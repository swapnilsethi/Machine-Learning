1,Musk’s Twitter Win Has Tesla Shareholders in a Twist,"Likely probably most other things Elon Musk has set his sights on owning during his lifetime, Twitter has succumbed to his will and accepted his bid to buy out the microblogging platform.

No doubt, Musk is overjoyed, but Wedbush’s Daniel Ives reckons Tesla (TSLA) shareholders aren’t as enthusiastic.

More specifically, the analyst thinks there are two main reasons why Tesla investors are unhappy about Musk’s new endeavor.

For one, while Musk has announced a financing package of $46.5 billion having already secured $13 billion in bank loans, and an additional $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stake, he still needs to come up with $21 billion for the deal to come to fruition. Musk might be the world’s richest person, but most of his fortune is tied up in his 21% ownership of Tesla.

Naturally, Tesla investors are worried that this could result in some piece of Musk's Tesla ownership being sold over the coming year.

Combine the uncertainty around the financing with the debt bring taken on and now a “good portion of Musk's Tesla shares will be spoken for/used as collateral for this deal, which is putting near-term pressure on the stock,"" Ives wrote.

“As we have said before,” stressed the 5-star analyst, “the Twitter transaction was never ideal for Tesla investors as the stock will now ultimately bear the burden of acquiring Twitter through its equity based financing mechanics.”

The other concern revolves around there being another element vying for Musk’s attention. Will Musk be distracted by the new undertaking? Ives doesn’t actually think this is much of a problem, as he does not see Musk becoming CEO of Twitter but rather expects him to take on a Chairman of the Board role with “less time pressures around transforming Twitter.”

“However,” the analyst summed up, “the Twitter deal brings another X variable into the mix for Musk which will be a concern for investors until they are proven otherwise.”

All in all, though, there’s no change to Ives’ Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating or $1,400 price target. The figure makes room for one-year upside of ~61%. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)

Ives’ objective is on the bullish end of the spectrum; the Street’s average target is a more modest $980.41, which is set to yield returns of ~13% over the coming months. All in, the stock’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 14 Buys, 8 Holds and 5 sells. (See Tesla stock forecast on TipRanks)

Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) bulls tried to make it a tech stock last year. They got their wish in the worst possible way.

On the back of analyst recommendations, Ford rose like a tech stock in 2021, with a January high of over $25/share. Since then, it has fallen like a tech stock. It opened for trade April 29 at $14.50/share.

As a car stock, Ford is still a work in progress. Ford reported an operating profit of $1.34 billion for the first quarter, on revenue of $34.5 billion. This became a net loss of $3.1 billion, 78 cents per share, on the $4.85 billion loss it took on stock in Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), the electric car start-up it invested in alongside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

F Ford Motor $14.49

Reasons to Believe in Ford

There are a lot of reasons to be hopeful about Ford’s future.

The first-quarter number beat earnings estimates handily, when the Rivian loss is taken out.

7 A-Rated Dividend Stocks to Buy Forever

Ford’s reorganization is going according to plan. It plans to milk profits at Ford Blue, which is making gas-powered vehicles, and in Ford Pro, which will sell directly to commercial accounts. It plans to invest heavily in Ford Model e, its electric car unit. Model e is being run by Doug Field, whose previous job was at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), but who has worked at Ford and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Ford has already sold out 2022 production of its electric Ford Lightning pick-up and the electric Ford Mustang Mach-E. There’s even good news for car buyers, as total car inventory rose sharply in March.

The best news may be the hybrid Ford Maverick. It’s built on a Ford Bronco chassis but gets 37 miles to the gallon, 42 miles in town with its electric motor. Its price starts at around $20,000 and it’s outselling the Toyota (NYSE:TM) Tundra. It, too, is sold out for 2022, and the company is taking orders on next year.

Story continues

Why F Stock Dropped

Despite the good news, Ford stock still dropped 17% in April.

Bears did not like the loss on Rivian. A chip shortage cut first quarter production. The company has had to temporarily close the plant that makes the Mustang, due to a parts shortage. Management admitted results would have been better without the parts shortages. About 580 engineers were let go when the Lightning debuted. There are worries that the Maverick may not be as reliable as advertised.

The biggest problem is more basic, Ford’s dealer network, which is antiquated and probably unnecessary. When times are good, as they have been, the dealers take extra profit by selling above retail. That means Ford doesn’t get the full benefit of high demand, as Tesla does.

Fat dealer markups cost Ford money and hurt its reputation. Dealers also have political power, which was once used mainly to fight Tesla but is now deployed to maintain their advantages over manufacturers.

The Bottom Line on F Stock

Ford is still a car company, not a tech company.

Ford manufactures cars with a complex supply chain and sells them through dealers. Tesla, on the other hand, controls its supply chain and has cut out the middlemen.

The value of this difference is currently $850 billion. That’s the difference between the market capitalizations of Tesla and Ford.

Ford does deliver what Tesla refuses to, a dividend that currently yields 2.64%. But analysts still aren’t expecting great things. The latest price target at Barclays (NYSE:BCS) is $16/share, that’s barely 10% over where Ford is currently trading.

To become a tech stock like Tesla, Ford needs to do more than reorganize. It needs to go to war against itself.

14,Elon Musk is taking over auto insurance too — should you get Tesla to cover your car?,"Elon Musk is taking over auto insurance too — should you get Tesla to cover your car?

As he did with the electric car industry, Elon Musk is aiming to revolutionize car insurance, promising drivers up to 60% off their premiums.

Tesla Insurance launched in Colorado, Oregon and Virginia this month, after bringing its services to Texas, Illinois, Arizona, Ohio and (to a limited extent) California.

The company, which hopes to expand to most other states this year and internationally in the future, says its customers are now free from being judged on their credit, age, gender or even their claims history.

While all of that sounds enticing, Tesla Insurance may not be a perfect option for everyone — if it's even an option at all.

Are you part of the club?

Right off the bat, Tesla Insurance is only available to Tesla car owners, and there are no plans to change that.

The company says the reason it offers lower rates in the first place is that it “uniquely understands its vehicles” and their “technology, safety and repair costs.”

If you don’t have a Model S, Model X, Model 3 or Model Y, you’ll have to look elsewhere to find a big discount on car insurance.

And while Musk plans to offer his in-house insurance around the globe someday, you might have a bit of a wait depending on where you live.

“The regulatory process for approval to offer insurance is extremely slow and complex, varying considerably by state,” he wrote on Twitter last year.

Why you might switch to Tesla Insurance

Electric cars typically cost more to repair or replace than their gas-guzzling counterparts, and as a luxury electric vehicle, Teslas can be pricier still.

Motortrend has studied how much it would cost each year to insure the various models available with a traditional provider. Among other factors, these averages assume the owner is a single 40-year-old man with a clean record and good credit score:

Tesla Model 3: $2,114 - $2,351 Tesla Model S: $3,673 - $4,143 Tesla Model Y: $2,118 - $2,227 Tesla Model X: $3,355 - $4,025

An average driver could save between 20% and 40% by switching, Tesla says, while some drivers could save between 30% and 60%.

Story continues

The company says it can charge less because it trusts its cars’ advanced safety features — and the driving data it harvests straight from your vehicle.

""Tesla uses specific features within the vehicle to evaluate your premium based on your actual driving,"" Tesla says in a statement. ""You will make monthly payments based on your driving behavior instead of traditional factors like credit, age, gender, claim history and driving records used by other insurance providers.""

That's a big change. While plenty of other insurers offer discounts if you install a tracking device and drive safely, they typically use that data alongside your credit, claim history and other factors to decide your rates.

Lastly, being held accountable for your behavior could force you to drive more safely, even if that means getting to your destination a little slower.

“Having real-time feedback for driving habits is actually resulting in Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way because they can see ... ‘OK, this is affecting my insurance rate, or it isn’t,'” Musk said in an April earnings call.

Why some might pass on Tesla Insurance

Speed demons with no desire to change may not appreciate their insurer knowing how they truly act behind the wheel, especially if they've benefited from a clean driving record or excellent credit.

Some drivers also avoid installing tracking devices out of privacy concerns, though in this case it's worth noting that the technology needed to use Tesla Insurance already comes baked into Tesla vehicles.

And while the company is enthusiastic about its use of data in most states where it operates, laws in California forbid insurers from using behavior-tracking tech to set car insurance rates.

""We want to have the kind of real-time insurance where your insurance costs are based on your actual driving history, which is the right way to do it,"" Musk said at a shareholders meeting last year. ""So, we are trying to get permission from the regulators.""

For now, Tesla isn't using data from individual cars in California and is relying instead on anonymous info pulled from a wide pool of drivers. That means a model Tesla driver in Cali will pay the same rate as a daredevil who makes hairpin turns and brakes at the last minute — assuming no one actually gets in an accident.

Tesla owners in the Golden State would be wise to compare quotes from multiple companies to ensure Tesla Insurance still offers the best rate.

16,9 Dividend Stock Picks of David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital,"In this article, we discuss the 9 dividend stock picks of David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Einhorn's investment philosophy, hedge fund returns and history, go directly to 4 Dividend Stock Picks of David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital.

David Einhorn founded Greenlight Capital in 1996 as a 27 year old with around $900,000 in startup capital, and currently serves as its President. He went to Cornell University where he graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in Government from the College of Arts and Sciences in 1991. For the first 10 years of running Greenlight Capital, Einhorn posted annualized returns of 26 percent, beating broader markets and showing a keen eye for choosing the golden stocks of the day. In 2007, Einhorn shorted Lehman Brothers stock, citing suspect accounting practices and an overexposure to illiquid real estate investments. This proved a genius bet as the company declared bankruptcy in 2008, establishing Einhorn as a renowned investor and a feared critic on Wall Street. However, Greenlight Capital has not enjoyed the same trailblazing success in recent years, and has significantly underperformed peers and the market.

From approximately $12 billion in 2014, the fund's assets under management (AUM) currently stand at $1.74 billion as of the fourth quarter of 2021. This downward journey was exacerbated by poor investor confidence resulting from short bets against Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) which turned out to be extraordinarily misjudged. During the fourth quarter, Greenlight Capital's top 10 holdings represented 75.69% of its entire portfolio. The fund made 12 new purchases in the quarter, made additional purchases in 7 stocks, and sold out of and reduced holdings in 13 stocks. However, for this article we'll be focusing on the top dividend stock picks of David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital.

“Intel announced they are removing stock-based compensation from non-GAAP earnings in 2022 to report results aligning with semiconductor peers. This may seem like a reasonable thing to do as comparability between peers becomes easier. On the other hand, what exactly is the point of adjusted earnings? It is not to conform to some industry norm or because the management teams need to make performance metrics. The point of adjusting earnings is to present results in a light that more closely reflects the actual underlying performance of the business. That is, backing out expenses that might be one-time in nature, such as legal or fire expenses. First off, share-based compensation is an actual expense. Decreasing my ownership stake in a company without receiving any compensation is not free. If a company paid its employees in all stock, would they add back the entire SBC? What a margin profile that would be. Second, should a company be worried about reporting results similar to other companies? Every company is unique. Management should not waste time determining what expenses should be excluded. Run the business, don’t worry about adjusting the numbers.”

Greenlight Capital’s Stake Value: $16.23 millionGreenlight Capital’s 13F Portfolio: 0.92%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36

20,China COVID hard line eats into everything from Teslas to tacos,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - When Tesla's Shanghai plant and other auto factories were shut over the last two months by emergency measures to control China’s biggest COVID-19 outbreak, the burning question was how quickly they could restart to meet surging demand.

But with the Shanghai lockdown grinding into its fourth week, and similar measures imposed in dozens of smaller cities, the world’s largest boom market for electric cars has gone bust.

Other companies from luxury goods makers to fast-food restaurants have also offered a first read on the lost sales and shaken confidence of recent weeks, even as Beijing rolls out measures to help COVID-hit industries and stimulate demand.

Joey Wat, CEO of Yum China, which owns KFC and Taco Bell, said in a letter to investors that April sales had been “significantly impacted” by COVID controls. In response, the company simplified its menu, streamlined staffing and promoted bulk orders for locked-down communities, she said.

The pressing question now is: how and when will Chinese consumers start buying everything from Teslas to tacos again?

In China's once-hot EV market, the recent turmoil is a stark example of a one-two economic punch, first to supply and then to demand, from Beijing’s hard-line implementation of COVID controls across the world’s second-largest economy.

Before Shanghai was locked down in early April to contain a COVID-19 outbreak, sales of electric vehicles had been booming. Tesla’s sales in China had jumped 56% in the first quarter, while sales for EVs from its larger rival in China, BYD, had quintupled. Then came the lockdowns.

Showrooms, stores and malls in Shanghai were shut and its 25 million residents were unable to shop online for much beyond food and daily necessities due to delivery bottlenecks. Analysts at Nomura estimated in mid-April that 45 cities in China, representing 40% of its GDP, were under full or partial lockdowns, with the economy at a growing risk of recession.

Story continues

The China Passenger Car Association estimated retail deliveries of passenger cars in China were 39% lower in the first three weeks of April from a year earlier.

COVID control measures cut into shipments, car dealers held back from promoting new models, and sales tumbled in China’s richest markets of Shanghai and Guangdong, the association said.

One dealer of a premium German car brand in Jiangsu province, which borders Shanghai, told Reuters sales plunged by one-third to half in April, citing lockdowns and trucking bottlenecks that made it difficult to deliver orders.

He was even more worried about the impact on consumer spending power, he said, declining to give his name as he was not permitted to speak to the media.

""It could be worse than the first wave of COVID in 2020, when the economic recovery was quick and strong. Nowadays there are more uncertainties in the economy, and the stock and property markets are not doing well,"" he said.

DOWNWARD SPIRAL

“Much will depend on how fast these restrictions can be lifted but the coming weeks may be difficult,” Helen de Tissot, chief financial officer at French spirits maker Pernod Ricard, told Reuters on Thursday.

Kering, which owns luxury brands including Gucci and Saint Laurent, said a “significant chunk” of its stores had been shuttered in April.

“It’s very difficult to predict what will happen after the lockdown,” said Jean-Marc Duplaix, Kering’s chief financial officer.

Apple also warned at its latest results over COVID-hit demand in China.

City authorities from Beijing to Shenzhen are trying to stimulate some demand by giving out millions of dollars worth of shopping vouchers to encourage residents to spend.

On Friday, Guangdong, a manufacturing powerhouse with an economy larger than South Korea’s, rolled out its own incentives to try to restart sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids.

These include subsidies of up to 8,000 yuan ($1,200) for a select range of what China classes as “new energy vehicles”, including from Volkswagen and BYD. Tesla, second in EV sales in China, was excluded from the subsidy programme.

The U.S. automaker did not respond to a request for comment.

Chongqing, another major auto manufacturing hub, in March said it would offer cash of up to 2,000 yuan ($300) for shoppers who exchange old cars for new models and set aside another $3 million for other measures to spur sales.

While noting such measures, Credit Suisse analysts still said they believe COVID control measures have put both online and offline consumption on a downward spiral.

""We see the consumer sector as being at major risk if the prolonged pandemic and further tightening continue across China,"" they said in an April 19 research note.

26,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Alphabet, Amazon and Tesla","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – May 2, 2022 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Tesla TSLA.

These 2 Giants Share a Bullish Catalyst Moving Forward

When shares carry a steep price tag, the barrier of entry for potential investors is sometimes too steep, causing them to steer away and look elsewhere to park their hard-earned cash.

Fractional shares have gained popularity over the recent term, but not all have access to this accommodating feature. Companies combat this steep barrier of entry via a stock split, one of the more shareholder-friendly and exciting announcements that a company can make.

A stock split doesn't affect a company's valuation. However, it does lower the value of each individual share, providing ease for the stock price to multiply once again and provide investors with considerable gains. Simply put, it's generally a bullish catalyst.

We've recently gotten announcements from two giants in the market – Alphabet and Amazon – that the companies would soon be splitting their stock. Needless to say, it shocked the market, as Amazon hasn't split shares since 1999, and Alphabet hasn't split their Class A shares since 2014. Both companies will be performing a 20-for-1 split.

It's no secret that these two giant companies have skyrocketed in valuation over the last several years due to their popularity with investors, causing the share price to become a significant barrier to entry.

Share Performance Woes

It's been a tough year-long stretch for AMZN and GOOGL shares. Amazon shares have declined quite drastically and underperformed the general market, but Alphabet shares have managed to show a higher blend of defense. Amazon shares have been negatively affected by supply-chain issues, rising labor costs, and unionization talks.

Additionally, in its quarterly report last night, AMZN revealed that expenses had surged and posted less-than-expected revenue growth. A rare EPS miss in Alphabet's quarterly report earlier this week has recently sent its shares downwards.

Story continues

Stock Split Success

Tesla is one of the best examples to analyze whenever gauging how stock splits affect a company's share price. TSLA last recorded a 5-for-1 split in August 2020, opening the floodgates for many new buyers. The company split its stock for a simple reason – the price tag on shares had increased dramatically following a surge of interest from investors.

The split sent shares flying. The chart below illustrates just how far shares moved in a month following the split announcement on August 11th, 2020.

TSLA shares no doubt benefited from the split. It's pretty common for a company's shares to move upwards following a split, and I see no reason why the same can't be true for GOOGL and AMZN.

In fact, Alphabet and Amazon simply announcing their plans for a stock split was enough to send both companies' shares flying. On March 9th, when the news first broke that AMZN would be splitting, shares jumped nearly 6% the next day. In Google's quarterly earnings in February, the company announced the split; shares surged 7.5% the following day.

The splits will also provide a higher level of liquidity; once the share count is increased, the bid-ask becomes tighter and makes it much easier for investors to buy shares.

Bottom Line

With the adverse price action we have witnessed following Amazon's and Alphabet's quarterly reports, it feels almost inevitable that rough waters are on the horizon. However, I believe that both companies have at least one major bullish catalyst moving forward – a stock split.

Amazon undoubtedly benefited immensely from the surge in pandemic-induced online shopping, displayed by its historic increase in revenue and valuation from 2020 to 2021. The trend has recently turned unfavorable for the company, shown in its quarterly revenue.

However, the stock split announcement is still enough for me to have an optimistic outlook for Amazon shares moving forward. The company has also displayed its shareholder-friendly nature via the announcement of a $10 billion share buyback when it revealed its plans to split its stock. The stock split takes place on June 6th.

Like AMZN, Alphabet was able to reap the rewards of the high-traffic online world during the pandemic whenever everybody was locked inside, no doubt fueling the run that shares went on before recently coming to a halt in 2022. Aside from the split, another positive moving forward for GOOGL shares is the announcement of a sizable $70 billion share buyback unveiled this week in its quarterly report. Alphabet's stock split takes place July 15th.

I believe that it's vital for investors to realize that these companies can't stay down forever and that their shares can walk down a more prosperous moving forward, especially after the splits take place. Additionally, a stock split usually indicates that the company is in good health.

5 Stocks to Buy at Lucrative Valuations After April's Mayhem

We are on the verge of completing a highly disappointing April with just a day of trading left. Historically, April is considered a strong month on Wall Street. However, this year, market participants failed to find any direction owing to extreme volatility. Despite several come back attempts, major stock indexes are in red this month.

Interestingly, April's meltdown has made several stocks highly attractive at their current valuations. Many of these stocks have a strong upside left for the rest of 2022. We have selected five from this space with a favorable Zacks Rank. These are — Tesla Inc., Pool Corp., Alcoa Corp., Zebra Technologies Corp. and SVB Financial Group.

Markets Suffer a Blow in April

U.S. stock markets have been reeling under severe volatility since the beginning of 2022. However, major stock indexes rebounded in March although the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, which was in line with investors' expectations.

Despite raising interest rate for the first time in three years, several measures of inflation have shown no signs of a downtrend and remained elevated at a 40-year high. Soaring inflation has compelled Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to say that the central bank will not hesitate to take harsher measurers in 2022. Fed's March FOMC minutes also indicated the same.

Market participants are overwhelmingly expecting the Fed to hike interest rate by 50 basis points in both May and June FOMC and will start shrinking the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet starting from May.

Story continues

A more than hawkish Fed, the continuation of high inflationary pressure due to lingering global supply-chain disruptions, the prolonged war between Russia and Ukraine and the resurgence of COVID-19 infections in China and lockdown in several parts of that country have significantly shaken investors' confidence.

Month to date, the three major indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 2.2%, 5.4% and 9.5%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite is currently in bear territory declining 20.6% from its recent high. The S&P 500 is in correction zone after falling 11% from its recent peak. The Dow is down 8.2% from its recent high.

5 Top Stocks at Attractive Valuation

Wall Street's turmoil in April has made several large-cap (market capital > $10 billion) highly attractive at their current valuation. Buying these stocks on the dip should give good benefit going forward. We narrowed down our search to five such stocks that have strong upside left for the rest of 2022.

These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days indicating that market is expecting these companies to do solid business in 2022. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Tesla has acquired a substantial market share within the electric car segment. Increasing Model 3 delivery, which forms a significant chunk of TSLA's overall deliveries, is aiding its top line. Along with Model 3, Model Y is contributing to its revenues. The global auto industry is gradually moving toward electric vehicles. Tesla is expected to be the largest beneficiary of this trend.

Despite the chip crisis, Tesla reported record deliveries of 310,048 units in first-quarter 2022. Additionally, TSLA's energy generation and storage revenues are growing, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products.

Zacks Rank #2 TSLA has an expected earnings growth rate of 66.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 13.6% over the last 7 days. Tesla is currently trading at a 29.4% discount to its 52-week high.

Pool is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related products. POOL is benefitting from the solid performance of base business, large market presence and strategic expansions through acquisitions.

Solid demand across heaters, pumps, filters, lighting, automation and pool remodeling also benefited it. POOL remains optimistic on the back of products (such as automation and the connected pool), the continuation of the de-urbanization trends and the strengthening of the southern migration.

Zacks Rank #2 POOL has an expected earnings growth rate of 20.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 4.4% over the last 7 days. POOL is currently trading at a 28.2% discount to its 52-week high.

Alcoa produces and sells bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products in the United States, Spain, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and internationally. AA operates through three segments: Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum.

Alcoa is engaged in bauxite mining operations and processes bauxite into alumina and sells it to customers who process it into industrial chemical products. AA offers primary aluminum in the form of alloy ingot or value-add ingot to customers that produce products for the transportation, building and construction, packaging, wire, and other industrial markets and flat-rolled aluminum sheets to customers that produce beverage and food cans.

Zacks Rank #1 AA has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 8.8% over the last 30 days. Alcoa is currently trading at a 28.1% discount to its 52-week high.

Zebra Technologies stands to benefit from a solid demand environment, coupled with investments in growth initiatives, in the quarters ahead. The growing popularity of ZBRA's Enterprise Asset Intelligence solutions is likely to be beneficial. Strong cash flow allows it to invest in organic growth, execute acquisitions and repurchase shares. For 2022, Zebra Technologies expects net sales to grow 3-7% year over year.

Zacks Rank #2 ZBRA has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. Zebra Technologies is currently trading at a 37.7% discount to its 52-week high.

SVB Financial is a diversified financial services company. Growth in loans and deposit balances, efforts to improve non-interest income (acquisition of MoffettNathanson) and global expansion strategy will likely keep supporting SIVB's financials.

The acquisitions of Boston Private and the debt investment business of WestRiver Group are expected to be earnings accretive and will likely help SVB Financial further cement its foothold in the innovation economy.

Zacks Rank #2 SIVB has an expected earnings growth rate of 6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 14% over the last 7 days. SVB Financial is currently trading at a 32.5% discount to its 52-week high.

31,Warren Buffett reminds the world about 3 legendary investing tips: Morning Brief,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe

If I had to grade this weekend’s ""Woodstock of Capitalism"" – aka the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting – I would slap it with a solid B.

Was this Buffett’s most headline-grabbing annual meeting? I have listened to/watched enough of these spectacles in the past decade to say emphatically: No. Personally, I liked his annual meeting in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic as he sought to rally the world.

Sure, Buffett railed against Wall Street (he hates paying fees to bankers, as seen once more in the Allegheny deal) by saying it’s a “gambling parlor” and bitcoin for it offering nothing of value. He scared the hell out of everyone (again) on potential nuclear war. Charlie Munger flipped the bird to Robinhood (more on that below).

But all of this felt very stale to me, just vintage Buffett and Munger. I would compare it to comedian Andrew Dice Clay going to his bag of nursery rhyme jokes to please long-time fans – they are proven winning lines. So from a headline standpoint, I give the annual meeting a solid C (tough grader I know, but whatever).

Where Buffett earned his A grade, however, was in the investing wisdom he imparted on the crowd. Nothing new per se, rather great reminders one day after the Dow Jones Industrial tanked 900 points and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4%. A woman shows a card with photos of Warren Buffett (L) and Charlie Munger (R) during the Shareholder Shopping Day at the Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders Meeting at CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska on April 29, 2022. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA / AFP)

Here are three lessons Buffett served up:

1. Do Your Research

Buffett’s explanation on how he upped his stake in Occidental Petroleum to 14% of the company, underscored the need to do your own research and make it extensive if possible. Buffett saw 60% of the top holders in Occidental being no more than passive investors unlikely to take advantage of a dislocation in the stock price. So, Buffett saw that passiveness and a dislocation in the stock price, and went to work buying up everyone else’s shares not in that 60% group. Savvy.

Story continues

2. Buy When Others Are Fearful

Falling markets haven’t deterred Buffett. In fact, this is the perfect environment for him…and it could be for you as well, provided you can have a time horizon of more than one-day. Buffett spent $51 billion to buy stocks in the first quarter, notably HP, Chevron and the aforementioned Occidental.

Ask yourself this question this morning: What would Warren Buffett be doing after Friday’s big down day in the markets? The answer is probably not preparing for a stock market crash because a free newsletter is warning of one (not this one of course). No, Buffett is probably licking his chops as names he is watching have just gotten cheaper.

3. Buy Stock of Companies You Understand

Buffett mentioned he doesn’t know how to use email and has documents printed out for him. With that context, is it any surprise Buffett became the largest shareholder in printer maker HP in the first quarter? Nope. Meanwhile, Buffett has a unique view of demand for fossil fuels by way of his ownership of railroad Burlington Northern (and his other industrial companies). Is it any shock he's been plowing billions into Chevron and Occidental? Nope.

Bottom line is Buffett has long purchased stocks of companies he understands. It’s a wise course of action for you as well. If you don’t understand what that $2 biotech stock you just bought really does, why are you buying it?

Mesh the grades together, you get my solid B. Till next year Warren and Charlie (hopefully).

Happy Trading!

Odds & Ends

Trash talking: Charlie Munger didn’t show his age (98) when wasting no time ripping Robinhood a new one at the celebration of two billionaire investors. ""Wasn't that pretty obvious that something like that was going to happen?"" Munger said after bringing up Robinhood's business troubles, later adding the company's business model ""was disgusting... God is getting just. ... There's been some justice.""

About seven hours after the comment, Robinhood’s head of public policy communications sent me this statement via email: “It is tiresome witnessing Mr. Munger mischaracterize a platform and customer base he knows nothing about. [No, Robinhood doesn’t charge commissions and does not allow day trading or short selling. We never did.] He should just say what he really means: unless you look, think, and act like him, you cannot and should not be an investor. We’re happy to share our educational tools, as it also seems he is lost on digital currencies.”

Maybe a touch of age-shaming in the crypto reference? You be the judge. Somehow I don’t think Munger will be invited on as a Robinhood board advisor anytime soon. But maybe he should: Robinhood’s stock has crashed 72% since hitting public markets in July 2021.

Thanks for nothing, Amazon: If Amazon’s first quarter loss were excluded, the S&P 500 would currently be sitting on double-digit percentage profit growth to start the year, points out FactSet. Including Amazon’s loss, the S&P 500’s first quarter earnings growth rate stands at 7.1% compared to 10.1% if Amazon were excluded.

On another note, my co-anchor Julie Hyman and I got into a fiery debate on live TV on whether Amazon will raise prices on Prime again to help offset inflation. Julie says no, I say it’s going to $200 a year by the middle of next year. One Wall Street analyst we spoke with thinks Amazon Prime is really worth $400 a year (at least). I am curious on your hot take on this one – drop us a tweet at @juleshyman, @briansozzi and @yahoofinance.

Stock stuff: Lots of interesting individual stock stories are on tap this week. Take for instance Restaurant Brands, which is holding a Tim Horton’s investor day on May 3. It’s not the norm for a company of Restaurant Brands’ size to hold an investor day for just one of its brands (others it owns include Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes).

However, I think CEO Jose Cil doesn’t think Tim Horton’s turnaround is getting appreciated by investors, hence the showcase of the brand. I do think this could be a signal Restaurant Brands is open to spinning out the division in some form and reinvesting proceeds in faster growing concepts.

It will also be interesting to see the market reception to Bausch & Lomb’s IPO on May 6. The company is nicely profitable, is a consumer staple (contact lenses which you need if you wear them…like I do) and has strong leadership.

Anything other than a positive response, given these favorable investing characteristics, would be another major red flag on the broader market’s near-term direction.

Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz better bring his oratory A-game on the company’s May 3 earnings call. The stock has cratered 18% in the past month – basically encompassing his time back as CEO of the coffee giant. I would expect a challenging quarter from Starbucks, notably in its key market of China due to COVID-19 lockdowns.

But the stock’s recent performance reflects more than challenges in the business – it reflects a view Schultz is another tone deaf, fat cat CEO who doesn’t understand the current real-world challenges facing his non-HQ workforce. Schultz has to do a better job here, his listening tours so far have been a social media nightmare for him.

Yahoo Finance Trending Tickers to Watch: It’s a big morning for all things touched by Warren Buffett on the Trending Tickers page. Chevron seeing a lot of interest as Buffett upped his stake in the oil giant. Buffett disclosed a 9.5% arbitrage stake in Activision Blizzard, and its stock is seeing strong interest on our platform.

Not much news on HP from the Buffett event, other than the fact he owns the stock and prefers printed documents because he doesn’t know how to email. Occidental Petroleum received more praise from Buffett, and finds itself on our list.

Robinhood is on the trending ticker page not for anything good, but because Charlie Munger gave the trading platform a middle finger (again) at the shareholder’s meeting.

China-based EV makers Nio and Xpeng — volatile names that are usually on the Trending Ticker pages — are back on this morning as traders assess sales updates from each. Nio said early Sunday it delivered 5,044 vehicles in April, down from 9,985 in March.

Elon Musk’s electric-car-market leader said on Monday in a securities filing that it wouldn’t be able to file a proxy statement until sometime later this year, without providing a specific timeline. Tesla faced an April 30 deadline for filing its shareholder proxy after the end of its fiscal year on Dec. 31.

“We currently expect that our definitive proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders will be filed later than the 120th day after the end of the last fiscal year,” it said.

Investors are awaiting details on an anticipated request for a share-issuance vote the Austin, Texas, based company announced in a March 28 tweet. Tesla said new shares would “enable a stock split,” but didn’t provide details.

Shares of the company fell 2.2% to $851.58 as of 9:37 a.m. in New York. The stock is down about 19% so far this year.

The company may also need to have another look at a closely watched section on Elon Musk’s pledged shares, which appears to contain out-of-date information.

Tesla’s amended annual report shows the share count and options of key investors through Dec. 31, and other footnotes refer to dates in 2022. But the part breaking out Musk’s ownership, exercisable options and pledged shares refers to Dec. 31, 2020, the same date from last year’s annual report. The company had previously updated the figures through June 30.

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent through its investor relations portal.

The number of Tesla shares pledged by its chief executive officer has taken on added importance because of the $12.5 billion margin loan he arranged to help finance his purchase of Twitter Inc. It requires Musk, 50, to pledge Tesla shares worth $62.5 billion. The debt is secured by that stock, which can be seized by lenders in the case of default.

The discrepancy itself won’t affect Musk’s Twitter deal. But after his sale of about $8.5 billion of Tesla stock last week, he had just enough Tesla shares remaining to secure the new facility, according to Bloomberg calculations, though it depends on the company’s share price.

That calculation assumes Musk has 88.3 million Tesla shares pledged to secure existing debt that would be unavailable for the margin loan -- the figure as of June 30. An updated number should have been included in Monday’s filing.

Story continues

It might be a coincidence that Musk had increased his pledged shares to the exact same figure he had a year earlier, though the old date in the same footnote would seem to suggest otherwise.

Asia, home to more than half the world’s population, is Twitter’s biggest growth opportunity and arguably a far thornier challenge. If the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX billionaire makes good on promises to scrap censorship, he’ll encounter a plethora of perplexing regulations, wielded by sometimes authoritarian governments, pushed to the limits by a horde of first-time internet users.

The numbers alone suggest Musk’s biggest headaches lie abroad. Twitter’s monetizable daily active users numbered 179 million internationally -- dwarfing the 38 million in the U.S. in 2021, according to its latest annual report.

As a public company, Twitter has repeatedly emphasized it must abide by local regulations. Once it’s a private concern controlled by the world’s richest man, Musk will personally shoulder responsibility for navigating that thicket -- and the fallout if he fails.

“Asia has the potential to make or break the new Twitter,” said JJ Rose, a contributor to Australia’s nonpartisan Lowy Institute think tank. “It will depend on how he approaches it if can harness it for his free speech aims.”

Representatives for Twitter and Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment.

China

Twitter is officially banned in China, but the country will still demand a lot of Musk’s attention. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos alluded to the potential conflicts in a tweet shortly after Musk’s deal, asking “Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square?”

Story continues

An obvious point is that China is tremendously important for Tesla, the key source of Musk’s wealth. The billionaire will certainly face pressures -- implicit or explicit -- to fine-tune Twitter’s policies to please Beijing.

As the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market as well as a supplier of Tesla batteries, China is essential to the healthy growth of the centerpiece of Musk’s business empire. Tesla has also benefited from significant tax breaks in setting up his Shanghai Gigafactory -- its first overseas plant -- and been allowed to wholly own its local operations, a rarity for a U.S. firm.

A pressing issue is how Twitter handles China’s efforts to spread propaganda globally on the platform. The company in 2020 instituted labels for government officials and “state-affiliated media” for publications like Xinhua and Global Times, and readers are reminded of this government-backing any time they like or retweet stories. Chinese media have called the practice “intimidation” and already begun to lobby the billionaire to roll it back.

Chen Weihua, a journalist at the China Daily, appealed directly to Musk with the argument that such labels suppress free speech and contradict Musk’s stated principles. The billionaire hasn’t given a clear indication of how he would decide such matters.

“By ‘free speech’, I simply mean that which matches the law,” Musk wrote on Twitter. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.”

Bots are another matter. China has also used automated and anonymous accounts to distribute the government’s messages, which prompted Twitter to remove more than 170,000 accounts in 2020 for “spreading geopolitical narratives favorable to the Communist Party.” Musk has pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying!” and sounds determined to keep taking on the fake accounts.

Beijing has shown a willingness to punish billionaires who don’t comply with its wishes. Regulators have hammered the country’s tech giants and effectively banished Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma from public view.

There are incentives on offer beyond the electric-vehicle market. Musk’s SpaceX could certainly seek Chinese customers, while his Boring Co. may profit from lucrative infrastructure contracts in the country.

And what of Twitter itself? A slice of the Chinese population employs virtual private networks to evade Beijing’s control and use the service. Could Beijing also offer up access to its 1.4 billion people? Perhaps under the right terms. They would certainly not include free speech.

India

India is another high-stakes market for Twitter: there are half a billion internet users in the country and another half-billion getting online.

Twitter plays a role in India’s online discourse similar to that in the U.S.: the country’s political leaders use it to get their messages out, which are then relayed across TV and news networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was an early adopter and has 78 million followers on the service -- more than Twitter has registered users in the country.

But the New Delhi government has insisted on far more control than Washington has ever been able to exert. Tensions in the relationship spiked during farmer protests in the country in 2020 and 2021 as Twitter and the government clashed over what sort of speech would be tolerated on the platform.

When farmers’ groups demanded the repeal of certain laws they said favored corporate-run farms, they took to the streets and social media to make their case, including Twitter. Modi’s administration insisted the San Francisco-based company take down posts critical of its actions -- and Twitter at first refused to comply. Indian authorities then threatened to jail the company’s executives, which prompted Twitter to permanently suspend more than 500 accounts and block access to hundreds more.

Twitter Yields, Blocks Access to Hundreds of India Accounts - Bloomberg

It was a direct example of how support for “free speech” can clash with government edicts and legal compliance. Later in 2021, New Delhi tightened its grip over social media such as Twitter and Facebook: The government insisted that companies identify specific individuals as grievance officers, who will be responsible for handling official removal requests and who could face prison terms for non-compliance. Twitter acceded, albeit after a delay.

It’s not clear how Musk would reconcile his support for more free speech with such strict government controls.

“Twitter should match the laws of the country,” the owner-to-be said in an interview.

The issue is hardly limited to India. Nearby Sri Lanka restricted social media access in anticipation of protests in April, while Myanmar’s military junta last year disrupted internet access altogether in its push to quell opposition. Researchers found Twitter was the most-blocked social media platform globally with a total 12,379 hours of outages in 2021.

Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia has become one of the fastest-growing internet markets, fueled by countries like Indonesia and India getting their vast populations online.

Southeast Asia Digital Economy to Reach $363 Billion by 2025

But developing markets come with their own set of issues. Meta Platforms Inc. names the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia as prominent sources of fake and duplicate accounts. Meta, whose Facebook and Instagram services face similar challenges to Twitter’s, has for years reported in its annual filings that roughly 11% of its worldwide users are duplicate accounts and another 5% are fake. As with China, Twitter will have its work cut out to eradicate synthetic users.

Freedom of expression also bumps up against local laws in this region. Singapore passed a contentious “foreign interference” law last year granting it powers to demand user information from social networks, in an effort to prevent outsiders from swaying domestic politics. Would that square with Musk’s ambition of free-wheeling expression?

Vietnam has posed similar challenges for online service providers like Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, with a cybersecurity law effectively forcing a choice between upholding user privacy and adhering to local rules.

The question to be answered over the coming years is how far Musk will stick with his promises of freeing up Twitter -- not just in the U.S., but in the rest of the world.

“Asia is not North America and it is not Europe,” said the Lowy Institute’s Rose. “Musk has a globalist view and his business interests to date have tended to be fairly universal. But something like media requires a more nuanced approach when applied globally.”

49,Fisker Investors Should Be Glad Its CEO Left Twitter,"As soon as the ink was dry on Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Fisker (NYSE:FSR) CEO Henrik Fisker deactivated his Twitter account and moved over to Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram. You ought to be happy about this if you own FSR stock.

If there’s one thing investors know about Elon Musk, it’s that he’s not afraid to push his weight around while speaking his mind. If I were the CEO of other electric vehicle (EV) makers, I’d think twice about remaining on Twitter. He’s bound to tilt the ball in his favor while appearing to stand for free speech. Billionaires rarely spend $44 billion out of the kindness of their hearts.

There’s no way to know if the move by Fisker was merely a publicity stunt or a case of voting with his feet. However, it did attract Fortune’s attention, and the publication rarely gets into the weeds on such issues.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Fortune mentioned Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) 2008 lawsuit claiming Fisker and one other person stole its design ideas. Fisker claimed victory after the two parties went to arbitration. The judge sided with his predecessor company, Fisker Automotive, citing “overwhelming” evidence against Tesla’s claims.

After his departure, here’s what Fisker said about Musk and Twitter:

“I believe 100% in free speech. But I do not want my free speech to be actively managed or controlled by a competitor. And I do not want a competitor to determine how my followers experience Fisker as we grow our company. #Fisker #Love #EV.”

There’s no question it hasn’t been easy to stay long in FSR stock. It’s down 30% in the past month and almost 40% year-to-date. While I haven’t written about Fisker in a long time, I continue to believe its Ocean sport utility vehicle (SUV) has a legitimate shot at being a big seller in the EV game.

Story continues

And heck, Fisker’s been tasked with converting an Ocean SUV into the first electric Popemobile. Musk can’t take that away from the company.

I’ve long been a fan of Elon Musk’s. However, I don’t think a privately-owned Twitter is a good idea, especially when the owner is someone as mercurial as the Tesla CEO. More EV makers ought to take a stand, whatever happens on this front. Fisker has made the right call, and that is good news for FSR stock.

51,Biden administration announces $3.1 billion for America’s battery shortage,"The White House announced $3.16 billion is on the way to help with the battery shortage in America.

The money, which will come from funds in the recently enacted Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, was announced by the White House and the Department of Energy on Monday. Officials promise the money will help domestic manufacturers make more batteries in the U.S., iron out supply chain issues for components, and also mitigate some of the environmental impacts from battery manufacturing.

""We need a lot of batteries and we want American workers making those batteries right here in America,"" said White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy in announcing the news alongside her colleagues.

The effort is part of a broader push to encourage American independence when it comes to the precious minerals that fuel much of modern life but come from places like Russia and Ukraine as well as China.

The money will be made available in the form of grants to companies looking to build plants in the U.S. to process the raw components of batteries into finished products. Officials note the funds will require a match from the recipient company, and the minimum grant will be $50 million. That means the new plants will cost, at a minimum, $100 million each.

‘For electric vehicles, it's all about the battery’

Industry players have long noted that batteries are key to EV manufacturing.

General Motors CEO Mary Barra told Yahoo Finance Monday that ""for electric vehicles, it's all about the battery"" as she outlined her company’s plans to take control up and down the manufacturing process. Nissan COO Ashwani Gupta added in another Yahoo Finance interview recently that “battery technology is the main differentiator” in the auto industry.

During Monday’s conversation, Barra also discussed plans to launch multiple new American plants for battery manufacturing, which will presumably be able to take advantage of these some of these funds from Washington, DC to get them off the ground.

Story continues

“We decided we wanted to have control over battery cell manufacture,” she said of the efforts, adding that some new plants are already coming online and others will be finished in the years ahead.

“This funding announcement will punch above its weight in not only accelerating a transition to a clean transportation future, but also in securing one of the most important supply chains in the U.S. economy,” Brian Deese, the Director of Biden’s National Economic Council, said during Monday’s announcement.

Deese added that President Joe Biden has prioritized the battery supply chain as key for the nation’s economy and security. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has more than $7 billion in total directed towards the U.S. battery supply chain, with initiatives like recycling critical minerals for domestic manufacturing. There are billions more set aside for things like EV charging stations and electric buses.

Biden has set a goal of having half of the cars sold in the United States by 2030 be electric; those cars will need to be powered by a massive increase in battery production.

‘Help to underwrite the private investment we need’

The batteries run on components that are at a premium include lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese. EV makers like Tesla (TSLA) have recently had to scramble to source nickel and Rivian (RIVN) has warned of supply chain woes.

The White House has deemed EV battery production to be in the interest of national defense and even invoked the Defense Production Act recently. The invocation of the Act — which allows the president to require businesses to take actions deemed necessary for national defense — allows the White House to force the building up of domestic production capability in these key materials. In other words, it paves the way for more mining.

Wednesday’s announcement is focused on lithium-ion batteries and is not intended to spur further mining or production of the raw materials, officials say. Rather, it will give companies more tools to process the existing supply.

The administration says the money will help companies process the materials needed to make lithium-ion batteries — such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite — and help mitigate supply chain disruptions in the years ahead.

The money announced Monday “will help to underwrite the private investment we need in the United States to build a reliable industrial capacity,” said Deese.

Russia supplies about 20% of the world’s nickel, and both Russia and Ukraine are central to global supply chains of other precious metals. China dominates lithium production. Biden called efforts to secure battery components critical to “end our long-term reliance on China and other countries for inputs that will power the future.”

Industry players have said the U.S. is behind China when it comes to both the mining and processing these key minerals. National Mining Association President and CEO Rich Nolan recently told Yahoo Finance that it's important to catch up to avoid “trading one concern of geo-petro politics for another related to metals mining and metals processing for the things we need for everyday life.”

52,UPDATE 1-U.S. to spend more than $3 bln on EV battery manufacturing -White House,"(Adds quotes from administration officials)

By Trevor Hunnicutt

WASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - The Biden administration will allocate more than $3 billion in infrastructure funding to finance electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing, U.S. officials said on Monday.

The funds will be allocated by the U.S. Department of Energy from the $1 trillion infrastructure bill Biden signed last year. Among the initiatives will be processing of minerals for use in large-capacity batteries and recycling those batteries, the agency said in a statement.

Biden wants half of vehicles sold to be electric by 2030, a goal he hopes will boost unionized manufacturing jobs in key election battleground states, thwart Chinese competition in a fast-growing market and reduce climate-changing carbon emissions.

The administration is also positioning the measures as a step to secure energy independence and cut long-term inflation pressures exacerbated by Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

""As we face this Putin price hike on oil and gas, it's also important to note that electric vehicles will be cheaper over the long haul for American families,"" Mitch Landrieu, the White House infrastructure coordinator, told reporters in a briefing, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The latest funding will help establish and retrofit battery factories. The infrastructure law also allocated billions more for the government to purchase electric buses and install EV chargers. The administration has been collaborating with manufacturers including Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, General Motors CEO Mary Barra and Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley.

But the new funds will not go toward developing new domestic mines to produce the lithium, nickel, cobalt and other high-demand minerals needed to make those batteries. Some of those projects face local opposition and are tied up in Biden administration environmental and legal reviews.

""These resources are about battery supply chain, which includes producing, recycling critical minerals without new extraction or mining,"" said Gina McCarthy, Biden's national climate adviser. ""So that's why we're all pretty excited about this.""

In March, Biden invoked the Cold War-era Defense Production Act to support the production and processing of those minerals. He requested funding to support that initiative last week as part of a $33 billion package on Ukraine-related initiatives.

Tomorrow, the Federal Reserve’s meeting will likely see a half-percentage-point hike being approved, as hinted by the Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The meeting on this hike will start on May 3 and conclude the next day. It is expected that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policymakers could raise interest rates by as much as 75 basis points.

Stocks have already fallen in anticipation of the hike as higher interest rates will hurt the market. Moreover, the Fed plans even more aggressive rate hikes going into the future as inflation is still significantly above target.

The economy as a whole does not seem to be well right now. The U.S Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by an annual rate of 1.4% this quarter. With the Fed’s fight against inflation, it is likely to decline even more.

7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement

Therefore, I have found seven stocks to sell since they are likely to perform poorly after the hike. They are as follows:

TSLA Tesla $878.84 AMZN Amazon $2,419.55 NVDA Nvidia Corporation $189.39 BXP Boston Properties $116.37 VICI VICI Properties $28.60 LEN Lennar Corporation $76.34 XOM Exxon Mobil $85.63

Tesla (TSLA)

Story continues Tesla (TSLA) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, Italy

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a likely sell in the current market situation. The stock is significantly overvalued, and Elon Musk’s antics aren’t going to do it any more favors. In the case of a recession, investors are likely to liquidate their positions on TSLA. Moreover, the company will not do well in an economic downturn as consumers will prefer to buy cheaper electric vehicles (EVs).

That could already be the case as Tesla has been losing its EV market shares for quite some time. Moreover, an economic decline has historically been met with a sharp fall in gas prices. If a similar situation occurs today, it could further remove the incentive to buy Tesla’s expensive EVs.

In addition, Tesla’s first quarter robust performance failed to excite investors as the 80.5% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth is not sustainable amidst an economic downturn and supply problems.

Of course, TSLA can still perform if the market does not react as negatively to the hike. However, I believe that it is always better to be safe.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is down over 33% since July last year. However, its large market capitalization still leaves more room for decline.

The company had explosive growth in 2021, driven by high consumer demand, significant growth in online shopping, and stimulus packages. In 2022, Amazon will have none of those attributes to capitalize on.

In addition, the comapny’s Q1 results of this year have already been quite disappointing. Amazon reported a $3.8 billion net loss this quarter compared to $8.1 billion in net profit in the same quarter last year. Moreover, Amazon’s earnings per share (EPS) loss of $7.56 is a significant miss compared to an expected $8.36 profit.

7 A-Rated Dividend Stocks to Buy Forever

There is also a slowdown in consumer spending, which will be problematic for Amazon once it enters negative territory. Following the Fed’s monetary policies, it isn’t very likely that consumers will continue to keep spending during an economic downturn. Thus, In my opinion, AMZN is a sell for the short term.

A severe chip shortage and high consumer spending came as a post-pandemic blessing for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, the chip shortage has improved, and the slowdown in consumer spending could damage the company’s revenue.

Nvidia has been in a decline of 42% since November last year. Nonetheless, Nvidia is still significantly overvalued, with a $468 billion market capitalization and a $27 billion annual revenue. Additionally, the prospect of a disappointing Q1 result can make it even riskier.

Nvidia could be hit particularly hard in the worst-case scenario as expensive consoles and GPUs aren’t products consumers will prioritize buying while in hardship. Altogether, this puts it high on the list of stocks to sell if the rate hike hits the economy hard.

Boston Properties (BXP) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.

Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) has performed quite poorly during economic downturns. The stock declined over 70% during the Great Recession, and it took the company more than seven years to recover. Similarly, the stock crashed by over 50% during the Covid-19 crash, and it has yet to recover.

Moreover, the company was declining for four straight quarters before turning green due to the housing boom. In addition, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37.34 does not scream a buy for this stock.

7 Biggest Loser Stocks That Could Become Surprising Buys

Boston Properties will be releasing its first-quarter results of this year today. Therefore, it is challenging to say where the stock will be going in the short term. However, if economic difficulties are to persist, BXP is certainly a sell.

Vici Properties (NYSE:VICI) is another real estate company that could take a substantial hit if the housing market declines. Casinos are not recession-proof, and they are among the hardest hit when challenged by economic volatility.

Vici is less likely to be affected by rate hikes due to its debt being tied to fixed-rate notes. However, Vici won’t be shielded from decline forever. The company’s significant state in the casino industry and real estate assets can still drag it down along with the rest of the market.

However, I still believe that Vici has excellent long-term prospects. Yet, this is not the time to buy or hold the stock. Even with high inflation, it is better to be patient in the current market. The 8.5% annual inflation rate does not justify holding high-risk real estate stocks such as VICI.

Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) is a home construction company that has performed poorly during previous economic downturns. During the Great Recession, the stock declined over 95% from its 2005 peak, and the company took ten years to recover to its previous high, albeit briefly.

It is almost a given that the housing market will undoubtedly decline. The housing market has boomed off of low-interest rates and is now entering a period of volatility and instability. Whether or not the real estate market will crash like in 2008 is still debated. However, it is better to be safe than sorry.

Additionally, the home construction industry does not fare well during economic decline. Therefore, judging by the stock’s underperformance and the home construction industry’s vulnerability, I consider LEN to be a sell.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has minimal upside potential. The stock has lagged behind the rest of the market and has remained stagnant since 2008.

XOM has likely reached its peak before it starts to decline again due to the current macroeconomic trends. In addition, the shift to clean energy will have a long-term drag on the stock nonetheless.

Exxon’s boom from rising oil prices won’t last soon in the face of a recession. Historically speaking, energy prices have consistently plunged during economic decline, and Exxon is likely to be hit.

Therefore, due to Exxon’s negligible upside potential and significant potential for a decline, I consider XOM stock to be a sell.

Asia, home to more than half the world’s population, is Twitter’s biggest growth opportunity and arguably a far thornier challenge. If the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX billionaire makes good on promises to scrap censorship, he’ll encounter a plethora of perplexing regulations, wielded by sometimes authoritarian governments, pushed to the limits by a horde of first-time internet users.

The numbers alone suggest Musk’s biggest headaches lie abroad. Twitter’s monetizable daily active users numbered 179 million internationally -- dwarfing the 38 million in the U.S. in 2021, according to its latest annual report.

As a public company, Twitter has repeatedly emphasized it must abide by local regulations. Once it’s a private concern controlled by the world’s richest man, Musk will personally shoulder responsibility for navigating that thicket -- and the fallout if he fails.

“Asia has the potential to make or break the new Twitter,” said JJ Rose, a contributor to Australia’s nonpartisan Lowy Institute think tank. “It will depend on how he approaches it, if he can harness it for his free speech aims.”

Representatives for Twitter and Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment.

China

Twitter is officially banned in China, but the country will still demand a lot of Musk’s attention. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos alluded to the potential conflicts in a tweet shortly after Musk’s deal, asking “Did the Chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square?”

Story continues

An obvious point is that China is tremendously important for Tesla, the key source of Musk’s wealth. The billionaire will certainly face pressures -- implicit or explicit -- to fine-tune Twitter’s policies to please Beijing.

As the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market as well as a supplier of Tesla batteries, China is essential to the healthy growth of the centerpiece of Musk’s business empire. Tesla has also benefited from significant tax breaks in setting up his Shanghai Gigafactory -- its first overseas plant -- and been allowed to wholly own its local operations, a rarity for a U.S. firm.

A pressing issue is how Twitter handles China’s efforts to spread propaganda globally on the platform. The company in 2020 instituted labels for government officials and “state-affiliated media” for publications like Xinhua and Global Times, and readers are reminded of this government-backing any time they like or retweet stories. Chinese media have called the practice “intimidation” and already begun to lobby the billionaire to roll it back.

“One of the fiercest tests of Musk’s avowed commitment to expanding free speech on Twitter will lie in whether he withstands pressure from Beijing to whitewash criticisms and challenges of China on the platform,” said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of non-profit advocacy group PEN America. “Whatever incremental changes he makes on the platform in the name of free speech risk being subsumed beneath the weight of a heavy Chinese hand controlling what Musk has rightly dubbed a global public square.”

Chen Weihua, a journalist at the China Daily, appealed directly to Musk with the argument that such labels suppress free speech and contradict Musk’s stated principles. The billionaire hasn’t given a clear indication of how he would decide such matters.

“By ‘free speech’, I simply mean that which matches the law,” Musk wrote on Twitter. “I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law.”

Bots are another matter. China has also used automated and anonymous accounts to distribute the government’s messages, which prompted Twitter to remove more than 170,000 accounts in 2020 for “spreading geopolitical narratives favorable to the Communist Party.” Musk has pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying!” and sounds determined to keep taking on the fake accounts.

Beijing has shown a willingness to punish billionaires who don’t comply with its wishes. Regulators have hammered the country’s tech giants and effectively banished Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma from public view.

There are incentives on offer beyond the electric-vehicle market. Musk’s SpaceX could certainly seek Chinese customers, while his Boring Co. may profit from lucrative infrastructure contracts in the country.

And what of Twitter itself? A slice of the Chinese population employs virtual private networks to evade Beijing’s control and use the service. Could Beijing also offer up access to its 1.4 billion people? Perhaps under the right terms. They would certainly not include free speech.

India

India is another high-stakes market for Twitter: there are half a billion internet users in the country and another half-billion getting online.

Twitter plays a role in India’s online discourse similar to that in the U.S.: the country’s political leaders use it to get their messages out, which are then relayed across TV and news networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was an early adopter and has 78 million followers on the service -- more than Twitter has registered users in the country.

But the New Delhi government has insisted on far more control than Washington has ever been able to exert. Tensions in the relationship spiked during farmer protests in the country in 2020 and 2021 as Twitter and the government clashed over what sort of speech would be tolerated on the platform.

When farmers’ groups demanded the repeal of certain laws they said favored corporate-run farms, they took to the streets and social media to make their case, including Twitter. Modi’s administration insisted the San Francisco-based company take down posts critical of its actions -- and Twitter at first refused to comply. Indian authorities then threatened to jail the company’s executives, which prompted Twitter to permanently suspend more than 500 accounts and block access to hundreds more.

Twitter Yields, Blocks Access to Hundreds of India Accounts - Bloomberg

It was a direct example of how support for “free speech” can clash with government edicts and legal compliance. Later in 2021, New Delhi tightened its grip over social media such as Twitter and Facebook: The government insisted that companies identify specific individuals as grievance officers, who will be responsible for handling official removal requests and who could face prison terms for non-compliance. Twitter acceded, albeit after a delay.

It’s not clear how Musk would reconcile his support for more free speech with such strict government controls.

“Twitter should match the laws of the country,” the owner-to-be said in an interview.

The issue is hardly limited to India. Nearby Sri Lanka restricted social media access in anticipation of protests in April, while Myanmar’s military junta last year disrupted internet access altogether in its push to quell opposition. Researchers found Twitter was the most-blocked social media platform globally with a total 12,379 hours of outages in 2021.

Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia has become one of the fastest-growing internet markets, fueled by countries like Indonesia and India getting their vast populations online.

Southeast Asia Digital Economy to Reach $363 Billion by 2025

But developing markets come with their own set of issues. Meta Platforms Inc. names the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia as prominent sources of fake and duplicate accounts. Meta, whose Facebook and Instagram services face similar challenges to Twitter’s, has for years reported in its annual filings that roughly 11% of its worldwide users are duplicate accounts and another 5% are fake. As with China, Twitter will have its work cut out to eradicate synthetic users.

Freedom of expression also bumps up against local laws in this region. Singapore passed a contentious “foreign interference” law last year granting it powers to demand user information from social networks, in an effort to prevent outsiders from swaying domestic politics. Would that square with Musk’s ambition of free-wheeling expression?

Vietnam has posed similar challenges for online service providers like Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, with a cybersecurity law effectively forcing a choice between upholding user privacy and adhering to local rules.

The question to be answered over the coming years is how far Musk will stick with his promises of freeing up Twitter -- not just in the U.S., but in the rest of the world.

“Asia is not North America and it is not Europe,” said the Lowy Institute’s Rose. “Musk has a globalist view and his business interests to date have tended to be fairly universal. But something like media requires a more nuanced approach when applied globally.”

Instead it promised additional details would be provided as part of its ""definitive proxy statement"", essentially the agenda for an upcoming annual meeting.

The SEC’s required time limit for filing, however, expired over the weekend, forcing Tesla to warn it would need an extension.

“We currently expect that our definitive proxy statement for the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders will be filed later than the 120th day after the end of the last fiscal year,” it said in an updated regulatory filing made public on Monday.

https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1521072388733083649?s=20u0026t=uVUCNm2DiNR9FX3XYGKHXg

Coming so soon on the heels of Elon Musk’s $44 billion Twitter bid, the delay reignites an ongoing debate as to whether Musk may be overextending himself.

Apart from retweeting Tesla’s official announcement that the AGM will take place on Aug. 4, the workaholic CEO has focused his recent social media postings on the broader political fallout of his high profile takeover.

A Reuters report from Monday citing informed sources suggests Musk is currently in negotiations with large investment firms and high net-worth individuals about taking on more financing for his Twitter deal in order to tie up less of his personal wealth. Last week he sold roughly 9.64 million shares, worth around $8.5 billion to help fund his plans for the social media platform.

No direct effect

Details on the stock split—which does nothing but optically lower the price of each share—is key for many, because Tesla is beloved chiefly among retail investors.

Vanda Research named it as one of the top ten favorites of small shareholders alongside names like Apple, Chinese EV maker NIO, data miner Palantir and meme stock AMC Entertainment.

https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1521344018768023553?s=20u0026t=vaIYDr-BSKu_9qchlKgf9A

By comparison, portfolio managers generally pay little heed to stock splits as they have no direct effect on either a company's underlying fundamentals or its valuation.

According to data from Nasdaq, institutionals own only about 42% of Tesla versus, for example, 78% for Meta, another mega-cap tech stock with a dominant shareholder as its CEO.

A lot of that has to do with Tesla’s stratospheric price-to-earnings multiples that has attracted big name short sellers like Kynikos Associates’ Jim Chanos, Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn and Michael Burry of The Big Short fame.

At its current price of $902.94, Tesla trades at a very aggressive 73 times consensus 2022 estimates. It is set to open Tuesday roughly flat, in line with minor gains in Nasdaq futures.

The stock split would be the EV pioneer’s second. In August 2020, the company issued four new shares for each existing one investors owned.

77,Weekly Comic: Elon Musk's Dangerous Distraction,"By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) could be the act that finally brings Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) gravity-defying stock price down to earth.

For one thing, no amount of corporate finance jargon can mask the fact that Musk is selling one stock to buy another. The old rule - ‘if the guy who knows the business best is selling, do you really want to be buying?’ – still holds.

It certainly holds when you think that this is the second time in six months that Musk has taken money off the table, after selling more stock than he needed to last fall in order to pay his federal income tax bill. The stock, whose valuation defied gravity throughout the pandemic, hasn’t made a new high since the first of those sales.

The rule holds even more when one thinks of the potential that ownership of Twitter has for distracting Tesla’s CEO from his day job. Tesla is a company still in the relatively early stages of a multi-year expansion phase, with execution risks at every step of the way and with the company’s first-mover advantage being gradually eroded. The chance that Musk can manage Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as well as before while trying to umpire disputes between the lunatic fringes of U.S. politics and stamping out Russian or Chinese disinformation is surely not very high.

Tesla has always had a high element of key person risk, and this move only exacerbates it. It is hard to see how owning Twitter makes his presence on the platform even more of an asset to Tesla’s general marketing, and only too easy to see how it could weaken it. Jeff Bezos' question about Chinese leverage over the company is to the point: what price free speech, if those running your biggest future market doesn't like it?

So what, says the fanbase. Elon has a history of multitasking. SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company – none of these has stopped him delivering at Tesla. Why should Twitter?

The obvious answer is that none of the above comes anywhere close to the political sensitivity of a mass media platform, in a country that is never more than two years from elections. The second obvious answer is that Musk may struggle to turn around a company that has consistently struggled to turn a user base of hundreds of millions into money.

Story continues

“I don’t care about the economics at all,” Musk told a recent TED event, as he talked up his vision of Twitter as a platform for free speech and robust debate. That’s the kind of talk that underpins his friendship with former CEO Jack Dorsey, who said “I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.” (Dorsey is one of a handful of large current shareholders that Musk reportedly wants to stay a co-owner after he takes Twitter private, reducing his own up-front costs.)

However, Dorsey himself failed to make that vision profitable, and Twitter needs, badly, to make money from day one. It will have to service over $13 billion in debt, directly or indirectly, due to the structure of the $44 billion deal, at a time when interest rates are rising steeply. For comparison, in the two years before the pandemic, the company made less than $400 million before earnings and taxes – not enough to cover one year’s worth of debt financing at 2%.

Another $12.5 billion of debt is a margin loan to Musk personally, secured against $62.5 billion of Tesla stock held by Musk. Both the terms of that loan and Tesla’s own internal guidelines limit the amount that Musk can borrow against his holdings at 20%. Given that over half of Musk’s 163 million shares are already pledged against other debt, Musk would have only limited ability to provide extra collateral should the value of Tesla’s shares fall sharply.

According to Bloomberg calculations, if the stock falls below $837 – only 8% below its current level – then Musk will have to raise cash to provide the extra collateral. As the vast bulk of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, that would most likely mean forced sales. Musk, meanwhile, will hope that the stock can hold above it until his next wave of options - worth as much as $23 billion under his 2018 compensation award - vests. While the company's first-quarter earnings appear to have triggered the release of most of those options, cashing in may be complicated if the company suffers a downturn and has to hand over those billions while its free shareholders suffer losses.

To be sure, most Wall Street analysts – let alone Tesla’s devoted base of retail investors - have target prices for the stock comfortably above that key $837 level.

Yet the reality is that, even after a 22% drop from its all-time high in April, the stock trades at 117 times trailing earnings, 10 times its expected sales for 2022 and, most strikingly, broadly equal in value to all the other household names in the global auto sector put together.

Such valuations tend not to outlive sharp monetary tightening cycles. Whatever the long-term outlook for Tesla, the short-term overhang looks decidedly dangerous.

81,Ex-Tesla engineer aims to build next-generation battery materials in U.S.,"By Hyunjoo Jin

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A battery startup founded by a former Tesla engineer announced on Tuesday plans for U.S.-based mass production of next-generation materials aimed at cutting costs, boosting driving ranges and reducing the industry's reliance on China.

Sila Nanotechnologies will invest in the low hundreds of millions of dollars in a new plant in Washington state due to open in 2024, Sila CEO Gene Berdichevsky told Reuters.

He said that since Tesla was founded in 2003, the price of electric car batteries had plateaued rather than falling as much as anticipated, so new materials could help lower the cost to consumers.

Automaker Daimler AG has a minority equity stake in unlisted Sila, which is also working with BMW. Sila raised an additional $590 million last year, boosting its valuation to an estimated $3.3 billion.

Berdichevsky said Sila would use the new plant in the city of Moses Lake to make silicon-based anode materials that can store 20% more energy than anodes that typically use graphite, 70% of which comes from China.

Graphite is on the U.S. critical minerals list but silicon is not, as the Biden administration aims to reduce reliance on China in the battery supply chain.

He said its new facility aims to deliver annual silicon-based anode production sufficient to power 10 gigawatt hours of batteries in 100,000 electric vehicles, with a goal to increase the capacity to power 2 million electric vehicles a year.

Sila runs a test production facility at its headquarters in Alameda, California that can produce battery materials for about 1,000 cars a year, though it is instead making materials used in fitness watches.

Berdichevsky said Sila was trying to address the challenges of scaling up production to meet the needs of carmakers.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a plan to use silicon-based anode in its new batteries at its Battery Day event in 2020 but it is not clear whether it is using the breakthrough technology. Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Wade would be ‘a horrible thing,’ Austin Mayor says","Austin Mayor Steve Adler joins Yahoo Finance Live from the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference to discuss reports that the Supreme Court of the United States will be overturning the Roe v. Wade ruling, labor market trends, diversity, housing issues, and the impact of Tesla’s presence in Austin.

Video Transcript

- Well, we have been checking in with folks at the Milken Global Conference out on the West Coast. And one of the people who's there is the Austin Mayor Steve Adler. I caught up with him in Austin. Now I get to catch up with you again. Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for being with us.

I know that you're talking about the big economic growth that Austin has seen out there. But I do want to ask you about something else, an item that is in the news first. And that is this leaked draft of the opinion from the Supreme Court that looks like it could be poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.

And I'm asking you about it because as we've talked about before, Austin is sort of a liberal island in the sea of Texas, Texas one of the states that's poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, or poised to act on that overturning if and when it does happen. So I would ask you, sir, how seriously should we take this report? And is there anything that you're sort of poised to do about it?

STEVE ADLER: First, thank you for the opportunity to be with you again. I think everybody, most of the people in our city, are real concerned about this leaked opinion, first substantively. If Roe is going to go away, that seems such a horrible thing after being law for such a long period of time. Our city has done everything that we can to help protect that right for women, and to help everybody in our city be able to take advantage of this constitutional right.

I tell you, I am real disturbed about a leaked opinion. I've never seen such a thing happen this early in this process. And it just seems to be just another hit to our democratic institutions. As we lose more and more trust in our basic democratic institutions in this country, I think that's the biggest threat to democracy generally. So the way that this happened is also incredibly disturbing.

Story continues

- I would also ask you, Mayor, you know, Texas-- leaving aside what's going on in the Supreme Court, Texas is one of the states that has been working to restrict access. Is there any recourse you have in a municipality within a state that is making those kinds of changes?

STEVE ADLER: Well, the state's trying to make it as hard as they can for anybody to be able to assist anybody taking advantage of this right. But in Austin, where Roe v. Wade is so significantly supported, we've done things like supporting our area clinics by providing support for women so that they can take advantage of the-- of their legal right, helping them with logistics and costs. So we're doing everything we can as a municipality to make sure that this right not only exists but is one that people can take advantage of.

It's still the law right now. And we'll continue to do everything we can. But we live in a state that is trying to make it harder and harder all the time.

- I want to talk about the return to office as well. When you think about the number of companies, major tech companies, occupy the largest amounts of office space in Austin, so when you have more tech companies that are continuing eyeing the area, you know, what is the selling point, the proposition that you're continuing to discuss with them, especially in the face of some of the legal fronts that are taking place in the state, too?

STEVE ADLER: Well, I believe that the positions that are being taken by our state leadership with respect to abortion, with respect to transgender children make it harder for us to attract businesses, make it harder-- more difficult decision for people to decide to live here. But in Austin, we try to stay true to who we are. And we recognize that what makes Austin ultimately attractive, or the people that self-select to be here, there's a different culture. There's a different way that people view the world and each other in this city.

And it's really important that we maintain that and nurture that as an innovative, creative city with an incredibly high tolerance for taking risks. And I think that's a real differentiator and one of the reasons why these companies want to come to our city. The people they want to have work for them want to live in this city. And this is a great city for innovation.

- Mr. Mayor, one company or business you have attracted to Austin is Tesla and CEO Elon Musk. Now, he's had a lot of good early success there in Austin with his new factory. He has recently made a bid to buy Twitter. And he has floated the potential of closing down that San Francisco headquarters. Do you want to roll out the red carpet to get those Twitter workers?

STEVE ADLER: Well, there are a lot of Tesla workers that Elon Musk could bring to Austin that are exactly the kind of jobs we want. Those are the middle-skill jobs, the jobs that are paying $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year that are in his factories. And I want to do everything I can to help encourage him to bring those jobs because in our city, that's what we need in order to be able to maintain the people, the diversity.

We have an affordability issue. And we need to make sure that we don't lose the diversity and the people that create the friction that drive the art and the culture in our city. You know, I'm happy to have Twitter workers come here, too. I want Mr. Musk to help us with those middle-skill jobs.

- And then additionally here, I mean, thinking through all of the movements that we've seen in trying to bring more chip manufacturing, and especially into the Southwest, we've seen much of those projects be started out, where are some of the talks taking place in Texas, in Austin specifically, and adjacent areas to get some of that chip manufacturing? I believe AMD is one of the companies that also holds a lot of space within Austin.

STEVE ADLER: And that's true. And we know that Samsung just announced their $15 billion plan immediately outside of Austin. Those kinds of jobs are great, too.

Again, you know, we're really lucky in the city of Austin in that we have lots of $150,000-plus-a-year jobs. But if we're going to preserve the people, the breadth of people, the diversity of people, we have to make sure in a city where prices are going up, home prices-- it's getting more and more expensive to live in this city. We have supply issues, and we have to increase housing supply.

But we also have to increase the number of jobs that'll enable somebody to be able to stay in this city, where costs are going up. And the chip manufacturing gives us a real opportunity, both with those companies and then the satellite companies that form all around them, to have those $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000-a-year jobs that someone can get without a four-year degree, sometimes without a two-year degree. That's really the hole in our city. And that's why we're so hot on that kind of clean manufacturing.",2022-05-03T14:27:35+00:00

89,Media mogul Byron Allen hopes Elon Musk uses Twitter 'for the greater good',"Elon Musk is buying Twitter (TWTR) for $44 billion, pending the appropriate shareholder and regulatory approvals.

The bombshell announcement sent shockwaves through the media and business world with Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos suggesting the decision could give China leverage over the social media company.

Byron Allen, media mogul and the founder and CEO of Entertainment Studios, also weighed in on the surprise announcement, telling Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer that he hopes Musk will use his power ""for the greater good.""

""[Twitter] has significant influence...Elon is going to do what he's going to do, but at the end of the day, hopefully he is using that platform to bring us together and not divide us, because there are plenty of media companies out there that work to divide us and this country is too great to be divided,"" Allen said.

Since Twitter's board agreed to sell the company to Musk for $54.20 per share, Musk has said he plans to ease content moderation on the platform, raising fears that it will be inundated with hate speech, disinformation, and harassment — a problem for both users and advertisers, alike.

Musk has tweeted critical remarks about Twitter and its moderation decisions in the past, although the Tesla CEO has remained staunch on his free speech stance, doubling down amid increased criticisms and warnings.

""The extreme antibody reaction from those who fear free speech says it all,"" he previously tweeted.

I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means

""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk said in a statement following the deal's announcement.

""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.""

Overall, it is not fully known what exactly Musk will do once he officially takes the company private, but the move underscores his power as a businessman as Twitter joins an impressive portfolio of other Musk-led firms including Tesla (TSLA), SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink.

90,Apple Hires 31-Year Ford Veteran to Ramp Up Electric-Car Work,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has recruited a longtime Ford Motor Co. executive who helped lead safety efforts and vehicle engineering, a sign the iPhone maker is again ramping up development of an electric car.

The tech giant hired Desi Ujkashevic for the car project, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Ujkashevic had worked at Ford since 1991, most recently serving as its global director of automotive safety engineering. Before that, she helped oversee engineering of interiors, exteriors, chassis and electrical components for many Ford models.

The executive worked on Ford’s Escape, Explorer, Fiesta and Focus models, as well as the Lincoln MKC and Aviator, according to her LinkedIn profile. She also helped develop new electric vehicles for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker. And Ujkashevic has experience dealing with regulatory issues, something that will be key to Apple getting a car on the road.

The Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment on the hire. Ford, meanwhile, said that Ujkashevic has retired from the automaker.

Enlisting Ujkashevic suggests that Apple is continuing to push toward a self-driving car despite several high-profile departures over the past year. The project’s management team has been almost entirely replaced since it was run by Doug Field, an executive who left for Ford last year.

Building an electric, self-driving car is seen as a “next big thing” for Apple -- a new product category that can keep its sales growth from stalling. But the project has suffered numerous strategy shifts and personnel changes since it kicked off around seven years ago.

Turnover has been especially heavy over the past year. Besides the departure of Field, Apple lost key managers in charge of hardware engineering, robotics and sensors. In some cases, high-ranking engineers left to join flying taxi startups.

Story continues

After Field quit, the company appointed Apple Watch and health software head Kevin Lynch to oversee the project. Lynch is a well-regarded software engineering manager but hasn’t previously led the development of a vehicle. Still, the company has sought to accelerate the project under Lynch -- with the goal of announcing a product by 2025.

An Apple car would put the company in competition with Tesla Inc. and Lucid Group Inc., as well as traditional automakers racing to introduce electric vehicles. Ford has been particularly aggressive in EVs lately with a push to electrify the best-selling vehicle in America: the F-150 pickup.

Apple also is trying to master autonomous driving as part of the project -- an auto-industry holy grail that tech companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo also have been grappling with.

Over the years, Apple has struggled to settle on a vision for its car, which has been in development since around 2015. The current hope is to make something fully autonomous and remove both the traditional steering wheel and pedals. The company also has sought to emphasize safety with its vehicle.

To that end, the company is looking to develop stronger safeguards than what’s available from Tesla and Waymo. That includes building in plenty of redundancy -- layers of backup systems that kick in to avoid safety and driving-system failures -- Bloomberg reported last year. Ujkashevic could be involved with that component. Apple had hired Jaime Waydo to serve as car safety leader in 2018, but the Waymo veteran departed last year.

Ujkashevic is now one of the few senior managers on Apple’s car team to come from the auto industry, but there are some others. Last year, Apple hired Ulrich Kranz, a former BMW executive and onetime head of self-driving startup Canoo. Stuart Bowers, a former Tesla executive who worked on self-driving software, and Jonathan Sive, an ex-manager at Tesla, Waymo and BMW, also are involved.

At Ford, Ujkashevic was one of the company’s highest-profile managers, serving as a named executive on its website.

“Desi has a wealth of global automotive industry leadership experience,” her biography reads on the Ford website. The company credited her with improving products, quality and the customer experience at the 118-year-old company.

By Devik Jain and Bansari Mayur Kamdar

May 3 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow rose on Tuesday, as investors picked up shares of financials and beaten-down megacap companies, while being cautious about the Federal Reserve's ability to tame inflation without impeding growth.

Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with energy and financials up 2.6% and 1.7%, respectively. The S&P 500 banks index gained 2.4%, with Bank of America climbing 3.5%.

The U.S. central bank kicks off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Traders see a 93.9% chance of a 50 basis points hike on Wednesday that would mark the largest rate hike by the Fed since May 2000.

The spotlight is squarely on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference on Wednesday for comments on the future path of interest rates and balance-sheet reduction.

""The markets remain turbulent as investors try to get their heads around the combination of rising inflation, interest rates and probably slowing growth,"" said David Swank, chief investment officer at Hood River Capital Management.

""For the first time in many people's careers the Fed's hands are tied by inflation, so it's not clear that it can ride to the rescue if something goes wrong in the economy.""

Pointing to historic data, Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in its note that rapid interest rate increases could eventually reinforce inflation's negative effect on economic growth and potentially and significantly slow the U.S. economy by 2023. It expects U.S. GDP to grow 0.4% by the end of 2023.

Uncertainty around Fed's policy move, mixed earnings from some Big Tech companies, the war in Ukraine and pandemic-related lockdowns in China hammered Wall Street in April.

The Nasdaq Composite slumped nearly 13.3% last month, its worst monthly performance since October 2008 as richly valued high-growth stocks came under pressure from rising rates.

At 12:11 p.m. ET, the tech-heavy index was down 13.09 points, or 0.10%, at 12,522.93, as a drop in shares of Microsoft and Amazon.com weighed.

On the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 91.87 points, or 0.28%, at 33,153.37 and the S&P 500 was up 18.73 points, or 0.45%, at 4,174.11.

The two indexes were boosted by Apple Inc, Tesla Inc and Alphabet Inc, which rose between 0.4% and 0.9%.

Estee Lauder Cos Inc slumped 5.3% after the cosmetics maker cut its full-year profit forecast due to fresh COVID-19 restrictions in China and the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc slid 3.3% after the hotel operator forecast a bleak full-year profit.

However, Western Digital Corp jumped 14.4% after activist investor Elliott Investment Management urged the company to separate its Flash business and offered to invest $1 billion to facilitate a sale or a spin-off of the business.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.14-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.25-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

94,Austin mayor to Elon Musk: We would welcome Twitter employees!,"If Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk wants to move Twitter's headquarters from San Francisco should he become owner of the social platform, there's at least one place that would gladly accept those displaced coders and marketers: Austin, Texas, the home of Musk's new Tesla Gigafactory.

""I am happy to have Twitter workers come here, too,"" Austin Mayor Steve Adler said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""I want Mr. Musk to help us with those middle-skill jobs.""

Musk acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter (TWTR) in early April before striking a deal to buy the social media platform for $54.20 a share — or about $44 billion — a few weeks later. Musk, the world's richest person, initially committed about $21 billion of his own cash to the deal.

On Monday, Reuters reported that Musk was in talks with investment firms to secure additional financing so that he would not have to spend more of his own money, most of which is paper gains from his Tesla equity.

In any case, many in the tech industry are rooting for Musk to transform Twitter.

""Let's hope that an extraordinary company is built,"" noted tech investor Ann Winblad said at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, where she was in attendance.

Speaking at the Milken conference, media mogul Byron Allen told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer that he hopes Musk uses Twitter ""for the greater good.""

Austin's Adler is welcoming any employees Musk brings to the region with open arms — and he would be keen on getting more semiconductor jobs into the region, too.

""We also have to increase the number of jobs to enable somebody to stay in the city when costs are going up,"" Adler said, ""and chip manufacturing gives us a real opportunity.""

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), one of the most-renowned electric vehicle stocks, with a leading position on the market. TSLA stock delivered a strong performance in the past year, gaining 29.62%.

Recently, the acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion by Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, has triggered a sell-off of its stock, offering a cheaper entry point for the EV leader. The market reaction seems exaggerated, given Tesla’s untouched fundamentals and strong track record.

In the last four quarters, TSLA outpaced analysts’ earnings per share and revenue estimates, managing with ease to respond to lifting EV demand, while controlling supply chain problems. Besides, the EV specialist is expected to continue to grow at a fast clip. Revenues are estimated to advance 61.1% to $86.7 billion in 2022, whereas net profits are forecasted to inflate 131% to $12.7 billion.

TSLA offers a high-profit margin of 14.7% to its shareholders and despite high valuation multiples, the recent sell-off offers a good entry point for long-term investors. TSLA stock is currently exchanging at an overvalued 2022e price-to-book ratio of 21.9x and posts a forward EV/EBITDA of 42.1x.

Lucid Motors (NYSE:LCID) is a startup EV company. LCID recently started electric vehicle deliveries and is set to ramp up sales considerably this year. LCID stock dipped more than 50% since the beginning of the year and is down 30.96% to $18.89 per share in the last month.

The EV stock manufactures luxury electric cars with long-range and fast-charging capabilities, setting new standards in the EV space. Recently, LCID announced one of the largest-ever purchase commitments for sustainable electric vehicles with the Government of Saudi Arabia. The deal to purchase 100,000 vehicles in the next 10 years is a constructive catalyst for the EV stock.

While deliveries should only begin in the second quarter of 2023, LCID’s revenues are expected to extend 377.9% in 2022 to $1.29, amid strong demand for its electric cars. However, the stock is still in a bearish trend and could see further selling pressure in the next months, due to high valuation metrics that stand at a forward EV/Revenue of 24x and 15.1x forward P/B.

7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement

LCID stock might be the next Tesla in the following years and investors should consider adding it to their EV list. Besides, analysts offer an upside of 114.4% on LCID stock, with an average target price of $40.5 per share.

Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is another must-have EV company that should be on any EV stocks list. The EV stock is also stepping up EV deliveries and has already produced 2,553 vehicles in Q1 2022. RIVN stock has however disappointed, following the 68.55% to $32.18 per share it registered since it started trading on the NASDAQ.

RIVN needs more time to deliver and 2022 could be the turning point that EV investors are looking for. The company is backed by Ford and Amazon’s substantial stakes, conferring confidence on RIVN’s ability to take a chunk of the fast-growing EV market.

Despite that, Rivian is still profitless and its bottom line is expected to deteriorate this year, posting an estimated net loss of $6.15 billion. On the other side, net sales are set to bounce 250% in 2022 to $1.92 billion.

RIVN’s sell-off offers an attractive price to enter this EV start-up. The valuation metrics are more affordable than other peers in our electric vehicle stocks list, trading at a forward EV/Revenue of 15x and a 2022e P/B of 1.99x. In addition, the average target price of $70.77 per share offered by Wall Street analysts is attractive, corresponding to a 12-month upside of 119.92%.

Nio (NYSE:NIO) is a Chinese EV pioneer and a leading premium smart electric vehicle company, ahead of its smaller rivals as to EV deliveries. NIO stock updates vehicle deliveries on April 1, posting a record high figure of 9,985 delivered vehicles for March, an increase of 37.6% year-on-year. This positive announcement has not stopped the downward momentum on Nio’s shares, falling 49.42% to $16.93 per share over the year.

Demand for EV cars in China remains strong and NIO is well-positioned to benefit from it. The company is close to reaching an important milestone, with cumulative EV deliveries approaching the 200,000 thresholds in March 2022.

With these solid figures, NIO’s top-line growth is projected to surge 74.1% to CNY 62.9 billion in 2022, whereas net loss is expected to be slashed in half this year to CNY -5.47 billion ($827.74 billion) . Despite being profitless, NIO’s cash position is solid, with an expected amount of CNY 18.2 billion in 2022, down 51.2% year-on-year.

Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) is another Chinese EV carmaker, managing to enter the highly competitive automotive market, defined by high entry barrier costs. XPEV stock is also on the list of beaten-down EV stocks, after the 52.1% to $24.08 per share dip registered since the beginning of the year.

XPEV is growing at a rapid pace, with total EV deliveries jumping 63% quarter-on-quarter to 41,751 in Q4 2021. Top-line is expected to expand heftily in 2022, up 102% to CNY 42.4 billion and by 64.8% to CNY 69.9 billion in 2023. On the other side, net income is projected to deteriorate, from a negative figure of CNY 4.86 billion in 2021 to a net loss of CNY 6.59 billion this year.

Nevertheless, the EV stock is an opportunity at its current price, trading at cheap metrics of only 3.01x forward EV/Revenue and 4.43x 2022e P/B. The consensus of analysts delivers an average target price on XPEV’s equity story of $45.16 per share, representing an implied appreciation of 87.54% in the next 12 months.

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) is an established automaker that is investing massively to transition to full EV production. F stock posted a strong yearly performance, advancing 29.84%, but the share price has withdrawn 32.84% to $14.62 per share year-to-date.

The company has been impacted by growing supply chain constraint that has impacted production over the past quarter, but strong demand for Ford’s EV vehicles remains robust. Ford has ambitious goals and ‘has committed to reaching worldwide EV manufacturing capacity of at least 600,000 vehicles by the end of 2023, for which it’s ramping up battery supplies, on the way to making more than two million EVs annually by the end of 2026.

7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement

Despite that, the company posted a net loss of $3.1 billion in the last quarter, due to the loss on the valuation of investment in Rivian. Nevertheless, the mature automaker is trading at attractive multiples, exchanging at a forward EV/EBITDA of 3.09x and 18.8x 2022e P/E. Besides, it is expected to deliver a dividend yield of 2.74% in 2022, making it a worthy-buy name to put on your electric vehicle stocks list.

Chargepoint (NYSE:CHPT) is a leading electric vehicle charging technology solutions provider and is creating a fueling network in North America and Europe. CHPT stock is down 34.88% year-to-date to $12.94 per share and lost more than 45% of its market capitalization over the past year. The company recently partnered with Goldman Sachs to introduce new tailored financing solutions to reduce upfront costs of EV charging technology and raised $300 million through the purchase by Antara Capital LP of 3.5% / 5% convertible senior notes due in 2027.

These proceeds will contribute to sustaining the strong growth rate of the EV charging specialist. After a flattish progression in 2021, net sales are expected to jump 65.8% in 2022 to $242 million and 91.7% to $464 million in 2023. Despite these robust figures, CHPT stock is not expected to deliver a profit in the next three years and net loss is forecasted to attain $299 million this year.

The company had a cash position of $111 million at the end of 2021 that is estimated to expand to $315 million this year. In addition, Chargepoint exchanges at high multiples, with a forward EV/Revenue of 17.6x and an elevated 2022e P/B ratio of 4.81x. This growth stock might continue to witness turbulence in the near term, but the leading EV charging specialist has an upside potential of 89.95% in the next 12 months and is a great investment to diversify your EV exposure.

Specifically, Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID), which seems to have received much more attention than Fisker, announced on Feb. 26 that it had obtained more than 25,000 orders for its EVs.

Meanwhile, Fisker has announced that it plans to offer a relatively low-cost EV, which it is calls PEAR, starting in the second half of 2024. According to Seeking Alpha, “The vehicle is expected to have a sticker price of just under $30,000, significantly lower than most other EVs on the market.”

Assuming that Fisker can turn a profit on the PEAR, I think the EV will be positive for the company and its stock. Not only do Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) EVs sell for well over $30,000, but so do those of Ford (NYSE:F), Lucid, GM (NYSE:GM), BMW, and many other automakers.

As far as the warranty, the EV maker is backing the Ocean’s “powertrain for six years and 60K miles and battery for 10 years and 100k miles.” That may differentiate the automaker from a number of its competitors in the EV sector.

FSR Stock: Not a Buy

The market capitalization of FSR stock still slightly exceeds $3 billion. If the company converts 30,000 of its reservations to sales at an average selling price of $45,000, it will generate $1.35 billion of revenue.

That amount of sales over a multi-year period does not justify the current market capitalization of FSR stock. Additionally, given the high level of competition that Fisker will face until it releases the PEAR in 2024, it may have trouble getting many more orders for the Ocean and could even have difficulty converting more than 50% of the reservations it does have.

Fisker’s outlook has greatly improved, but it is still not yet a buy.

98,"Nio’s EV Production Picks Up Pace, Should Hit Record Levels This Year","Nio (NYSE:NIO) announced on May 2 that it reached 5,074 electric vehicle (EV) deliveries in April 2022. Moreover, its year-to-date (YTD) deliveries reached an all-time record up, 13.5% year-over-year (YoY). This was at the level of 30,842 EVs YTD. If this pace keeps up for the whole year, NIO stock could get a significant boost.

This is quite a feat especially given that the company has faced the shutdown of its plants. This was due to the harsh Covid-19 restrictions by the Chinese authorities starting in late March through April. Nio decided to suspend production on April 9 after the country’s measures to contain the recent surge of Covid-19 cases disrupted operations at its suppliers.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Reuters reported that strict lockdown measures were put in place in Jilin province and Shanghai where the plants of Nio’s major auto part makers and other automakers are located. For example, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has closed its plant in Shanghai since March 28 and only recently started slowly opening up production.

7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May and Hold for Years

Barron’s magazine reported that during the last week of April Chinese authorities began to allow auto production to restart. However, workers will have to live in factory-based dormitories in what China calls “closed-loop” production. Elon Musk told investors last week that Tesla is back to half of its 2,000 EV production run rate per week.

Where This Leaves NIO Stock

Assuming NIO can get back on track by mid-summer it’s likely that the company, like Tesla, will try to make up for the loss of production. This could actually act as a catalyst for NIO stock going forward. If the company shows a surprise revenue pick up during the second or third quarters, the stock could move significantly higher.

For example, as it stands, analysts still see revenue climbing to $9.53 billion this year, up 72.9% from $5.51 billion in 2021. Moreover, the financial forecasts for 2023 show that 20 analysts predict another 66% gain in revenue next year to $15.82 billion. This implies that over the next two years, sales will almost triple.

Story continues

As a result, Nio’s valuation at $33 billion today could be very cheap. Once the 2023 revenue figure becomes attainable in investors eyes, the stock will move significantly higher. Right now it’s on a price-to-sales (P/S) metric of just over 2x. By contrast, TSLA stock trades at a forward P/S metric of over 8.1x. That implies that NIO stock could more than double from here, once investors decide to become more positive on its prospects.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

- It ain't easy to steal the spotlight from Kim Kardashian dressed as Marilyn Monroe. But who can do that? Who other than Elon Musk. Musk did manage to do so at last night's Met Gala, walking the red carpet with his supermodel mom and even answering a couple of questions.

What are his plans with Twitter? Quote, ""Assuming everything gets done, making it as inclusive as possible and to have as broad a swath of people on Twitter as possible,"" adding that it's entertaining and funny. Asked about his wardrobe inspiration, he said he's just ""following the dress code."" I thought he looked like a conductor, but mom looked fabulous.

Inclusive Twitter, [? Shana. ?] That's not the way I envision it. To me, it's a penthouse that doesn't allow many people.

- Yeah, and also, going off of that, too, I mean, he's also said he wanted to make Twitter-- he wanted it to help make people's lives better, where I think a lot of people who live on Twitter-- I'm on Twitter all day looking at stories and everything like that. There's a lot of negativity on Twitter. So I'm not sure if he's going to help make it-- everyone's lives better.

But let's go back, because we were just showing it, and you and I were talking about it in commercial break, about exactly what Elon Musk was wearing, because I thought it was on theme. And I don't think everyone who was there last night was on theme. Now, he does look a little bit more ""Downton Abbey""-esque, I guess, than Gilded Age, so a few decades later. But I liked the outfit. [? Rochelle, ?] what did you think?

- So for me, honestly, I was too busy looking at his mom, who I have always loved. I knew who she was before I ever knew who he was. And I was like, oh, oh, there's May's kid. She looked fantastic. I thought he looked nice.

I mean, obviously the theme was Gilded Age, and he went for a very classic look. Obviously, he can't go anywhere without being asked about Twitter and what's happening with Tesla and everything else. But he said, when they asked him why he was even there, he was like, oh, it's because my mom wanted to come. So keeping it in the family.

Story continues

- Mama's boy.

- But still making time. Exactly.

- What do you think he talked about with Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson there? That's what I want to know. I mean, that had to be a very interesting conversation. My personal favorite outfit, because I know you're wondering-- Blake Lively crushed it. She does every year.

- She looked great, and so did Ryan Reynolds.

- She was one of the hosts. Well, Ryan Reynolds always looks good, too. But Blake Lively stole the show. But it would be interesting to hear that conversation between Kim and Elon, wouldn't it, [? Rochelle? ?]

- I would like to know who initiated it. I would like to know what they would all have in common to chat about, other than all just sort of being very, very hot trends on social media all the time.",2022-05-03T20:36:20+00:00

102,4 Value Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio in May,"It’s a good time to buy value stocks on weakness. General Motors (GM): Should be lifted by strong demand for its electric vehicles and its autonomous vehicles. General Electric (GE): Reported fairly strong Q1 results, and GE stock should get a big lift from the travel boom. Deere (DE): Should continue to benefit from high food prices. Cheniere (LNG): Investors are underestimating the energy company’s outlook as Europe looks for new sources of natural gas. Value stocks: A hand places wooden cutouts of the letters in the word ""value"" on a surface.

In an environment in which growth stocks and value stocks aren’t doing particularly well, picking names with low valuations and high profits makes sense. That’s because even investors who are skeptical about the market’s outlook should see the attractiveness of such stocks sooner or later.

Meanwhile, there are multiple signs that, over the longer term, those who buy high-quality value stocks on weakness now are going to make a great deal of money. Indeed, with sentiment towards the market terrible and the macro situation poised to improve, it looks like, if the market hasn’t bottomed, it will do so within the next several weeks.

Among the macro developments likely to reassure investors are the (likely correct) growing consensus that inflation has peaked. The latter situation, in turn, will probably make the Federal Reserve more dovish than many expect, and many anticipate that the Russia-Ukraine war will end sometime this month.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Also boding well for stocks, both Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) have recently decided to make huge investments. If they thought stocks were still far from bottoming, they probably would have waited for valuations to drop further before they made their moves.

7 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May and Hold for Years

Let’s dig into these four very attractive value stocks to buy on weakness:

Story continues

GM General Motors $39.79 GE General Electric $77.18 DE Deere $389.87 LNG Cheniere $140.63

Despite inflation and supply chain pressures, General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) first-quarter earnings per share (EPS), excluding certain items, came in at a robust $2.09. versus analysts’ average estimate of just $1.67. The midpoint of GM’s 2022 adjusted EPS guidance is $7, well above analysts’ mean estimates.

With GM’s EV sales likely to surge next year, GM stock is likely to start pricing in that positive catalyst within a few months. Moreover, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is upbeat on the company’s future in the EV sector.

GM CEO Mary Barra recently indicated that the company plans to deploy a robotaxi service early next year, a development that should also be extremely positive for the automaker and its shares.

Even with all of these positive catalysts, the forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of GM stock is now a truly paltry 5.6.

Bearishness towards General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock seems to have hit a fever pitch, just as the conglomerate’s medium-term outlook appears to have reached its highest point in years.

Specifically, with travel booming and likely to stay hot for some time, airlines are like to order many more planes and service their planes’ engines much more often than they have since the pandemic began. Those trends should tremendously boost GE’s Aviation unit, whose profit came in at $908 million in Q1. Additionally, the unit’s orders soared 31% year-over-year.

And because electric-vehicle sales are soaring while many countries are replacing coal plants with natural gas, the medium-term and long-term outlook of GE’s Power business is bright. Already last quarter, the unit, which GE stock bears had left for dead, generated a $63 million profit, and a 14% YOY increase in its orders.

GE stock sank because CEO Larry Culp said that the company is “trending toward the low end of (its 2022 ERPS guidance) range” due to “inflation and other pressures.” But inflation looks to have peaked, while the “other pressures” cited by Culp, including the war in Ukraine and supply chain issues, should improve in the second half of the year.

7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement

GE’s 2022 EPS guidance range is $2.80-$3.50. Assuming its EPS comes in at $3, GE stock is now trading at a forward P/E ratio of slightly below 25. Given the company’s multiple, strong, positive catalysts, that’s a cheap price to pay for the shares.

Deere (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.

Deere (NYSE:DE) stock is up 10% so far this year, although it has fallen 10% in the last month. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently stated that the company is the “market leader in precision ag at a time of insatiable farmer demand for new technology.” Indeed, with food prices quite elevated and likely to stay high due to the damage from the war in Ukraine, many farmers will likely continue to look to buy Deere’s products to boost their crop yields.

As Barclaysstated in March: “High grain prices bode well for farm incomes, and elevated farm incomes are typically reinvested back into the farm, including machinery and grain storage,”

On Feb. 18, Deere reported “beat-and-raise” Q1 results. It increased its FY22 net income outlook to “$6.7B-$7.1B, up from its prior forecast of $6.5B-$7B.”

After its recent pullback, DE stock is trading at an affordable forward P/E ratio of 16.6.

Cheniere (LNG) LNG stock: the Cheniere logo displayed on a phone

With Europe looking to stop importing Russian gas, Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG), which exports American natural gas, should grow rapidly in the coming quarters and years. Some pundits have worried that the Biden administration is opposed to allowing U.S. natural gas exports to surge. But the Department of Energy in March “authorized additional liquefied natural gas exports from Cheniere Energy’s… Sabine Pass, La., and Corpus Christi, Texas, terminals.”

Cheniere will be able to quickly take advantage of the permit as its “facilities already are making more gas than is covered by previous export permits.”

What’s more, from Cheniere’s perspective, U.S. natural gas prices are in a “sweet spot” — high enough to convince U.S. producers to step up their output, but still much lower than European prices.

7 A-Rated Dividend Stocks to Buy Forever

LNG stock is trading at a very low forward P/E ratio of just 10.

107,WRAPUP 2-Beijing restricts public transport as COVID spreads in China,"(Updates with more Beijing metro stations closing, latest in Lingang trade zone)

* Beijing shuts more than 60 metro stations, 158 bus routes

* Zhengzhou to enforce strict COVID curbs in coming week

* Shanghai finds it difficult to exit month-long lockdown

BEIJING/SHANGHAI, May 4 (Reuters) - The Chinese capital Beijing shut dozens of metro stations and bus routes on Wednesday in its campaign to stop the spread of COVID-19 and avoid the fate of Shanghai where millions of residents have been under strict lockdown for more than a month.

China's uncompromising battle against the coronavirus, which is believed to have emerged in Wuhan city in late 2019, is undermining its growth and hurting the international companies invested there, according to the latest forecasts and data.

The central city of Zhengzhou, home to 12.6 million people and a factory of Apple's iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, announced work-from-home and other COVID curbs for the coming week late on Tuesday, joining dozens of big cities under some form of lockdown.

The capital shut more than 60 subway stations, about 15% of the network, and 158 bus routes, service providers said. Most of the suspended stations and routes are in the Chaoyang district, the epicentre of Beijing's outbreak.

With dozens of new cases a day, Beijing is trying to avoid a full lockdown, as Shanghai also did initially, instead hoping that mass testing will find and isolate the virus before it spreads.

The city of 22 million people has closed schools, restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues, as well as some businesses and residential buildings in high-risk areas.

In what will be a worrying sign for Beijing residents, workers in protective gear were seen setting up a two-metre high blue metal wall around a residential complex, with a sign at the gate reading ""Entry only. No exit.""

Twelve out of 16 Beijing districts conducted the second of three rounds of tests this week, having done three screenings last week.

BLOCKCHAIN MEMORIES

In Shanghai, there's no end in sight for the lockdown.

After more than a month, most people in mainland China's biggest city are still not allowed to leave their housing compounds.

Some residents have benefited from a tentative easing of precautions since Sunday, with usually just one member of a household allowed out for a quick stroll and grocery shopping.

The latest data showed Shanghai found 63 new cases outside areas under the strictest curbs, suggesting it has a way to go before reaching the goal of no cases for several days for curbs to ease significantly.

The isolation has fuelled rare outbursts of discontent, with social media users playing a cat-and-mouse game with censors to keep evidence of the hardship circulating.

Some have turned to blockchain technology to protect videos, photos and artwork around the topic from deletion.

Such acts of defiance are awkward for the ruling Communist Party in a sensitive year in which President Xi Jinping is expected to secure a third leadership term.

Authorities say the zero-COVID policy aims to save as many lives as possible, pointing to the millions of COVID deaths outside China, where many countries are throwing off precautions to ""live with COVID"" even as infections spread.

GROWTH FORECAST CUT

But the policy is hurting domestic consumption and factory output, disrupting key global supply chains and shrinking revenues for some of the biggest international brands, such as Apple, Gucci-parent Kering and Taco Bell-owner Yum China.

Capital Economics estimates COVID has spread to areas generating 40% of China's output and 80% of its exports.

""Recent mobility trends suggest that China’s growth momentum deteriorated significantly in April, with traffic congestion, subway passenger volume and other high-frequency indicators at their weakest since ... early 2020,"" Fitch Ratings said in a note.

Fitch cut its 2022 growth forecast to 4.3%, from 4.8%, well below China's official 5.5% target.

Starbucks Corp said on Tuesday its sales in China, where the chain has rapidly expanded in recent years, declined 23%, overshadowing 12% growth in North America.

Foxconn said on Wednesday it was continuing production in Zhengzhou.

Numerous factories were shut after Shanghai went into lockdown from March. While some have started reopening, getting workers back, while dealing with snarled supply chains, has proven difficult.

Shanghai authorities helped Tesla transport over 6,000 workers and carry out disinfection work to reopen its factory last month, according to a letter that Tesla sent to officials seen by Reuters.

In Shanghai's Lingang free trade zone area, 252 firms, or 52% of the companies there, had resumed work as of May 3, the Xinhua news agency reported.

Authorities were subsidising the screening of workers for COVID, providing hundreds of millions of yuan in relief on rent, and assigning officials to help implement COVID measures, it said.

International trade is also facing disruption.

A study by Royal Bank of Canada analysts found that a fifth of the global container ship fleet was stuck in ports.

At Shanghai's port, 344 ships were awaiting berth, a 34% increase over the past month. Shipping something from a warehouse in China to one in the United States takes 74 days longer than usual, they said.

“At a time when social media companies face the prospect of tighter regulations around the world, we’re keen to learn more about how Mr Musk will balance his clear commitment to free speech with new obligations to protect Twitter’s users from online harms,” Conservative party lawmaker Julian Knight wrote in a statement published Wednesday.

The request from the influential Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee comes as questions remain over how Musk will run Twitter following his $44 billion deal to take the social media company private.

“I want to make it as inclusive and interesting and entertaining as possible, and broaden the audience,” Musk said on Monday, at a benefit for the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Requests to give evidence to a U.K. parliamentary select committee are neither legally binding nor mandatory, but companies routinely answer the calls and provide executives to speak. Evidence gathered is used by committee members to write reports, which are passed to the government to inform lawmaking and legislative changes.

Sometimes requests are repeatedly refused, however, notably in the case of Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. The social-networking giant declined to send the CEO to appear before an earlier incarnation of the committee, following threats of a formal summons.

The U.K. is currently introducing long-awaited and sweeping legal proposals to force internet companies to remove illegal content from their platforms, giving regulator Ofcom power to impose massive fines and prosecute executives personally for failures to comply.

The network’s pitch at the IAB Digital NewFronts, the annual event for digital companies to sell ad space to marketers, will be a “spectacle,” according to a person familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because the details aren’t public.

Sarah Personette, Twitter’s chief customer officer, will lead the presentation and announce a variety of new and renewed partnership deals. Twitter is also likely to address advertisers’ concerns about their promotions running alongside undesirable content, as Musk has made clear he wants to limit enforcement of the company’s content rules.

However aggressively Twitter wants to sell advertisers on its potential, it’ll be hard for the company to make credible promises about what the future holds. Twitter on Monday warned in a regulatory filing that it won’t be able to predict what Musk will do with the business. The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer’s deal for Twitter, announced April 25, won’t close for months, and in the meantime uncertainty could cause “adverse changes in our relationships with employees, advertisers and other business partners,” the filing said.

The company also faces a series of issues specifically related to Musk’s stated plans. A self-described free-speech absolutist, Musk has promised to take a minimalist approach to content restrictions. Musk has said he would be “very reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans” on Twitter, according to his comments at a TED conference in April. The impulsive billionaire has also talked about limiting advertising on Twitter. “I don’t care about the economics at all,” Musk said.

That could cost Twitter. “I don’t think brands can afford to turn up in environments that are not safe,” said Arun Kumar, chief data and marketing technology officer at IPG.“I really hope he knows what he’s doing, because if they relax the content rules and they open up the algorithm, I just don’t see how they’re going to control bad actors.”

EXPLAINER: Twitter, Musk and Why Online Speech Gets Moderated

At the NewFronts, beyond its presentation, Twitter employees will mingle with ad-buyers, content creators and others who use the conference to decide how much time and money to dedicate to Twitter’s platform.

Musk’s vision to ease content-moderation policies may be welcomed by those who believe Twitter disproportionately silences conservative political speech, but it has alarmed Black, LGBTQ+, Muslim and other groups who are worried about increased harassment on the platform. Meanwhile, advertisers have expressed concern that their ads will show up next to controversial posts if content moderation rules are loosened.

On Tuesday, a group of 26 organizations, including Media Matters for America, GLAAD and Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, issued a statement calling on Twitter’s top advertisers to demand that Musk commit to upholding “standards of community trust and safety, and to pull their advertising spending from Twitter if he does not.”

“Under the guise of ‘free speech,’ [Musk’s] vision will silence and endanger marginalized communities, and tear at the fraying fabric of democracy,” the group said in its statement.

The advocacy group coalition is demanding, among other things, that Twitter commits to keeping public figures and politicians that were removed for violating Twitter’s rules, like former President Donald Trump, off the platform. Many have speculated that upon taking control of the company, Musk would move to reinstate controversial accounts that have been suspended.

That’s not something Twitter can promise, because employees do not know Musk’s plans. Prior to Musk’s takeover, Twitter doesn’t intend to change its commitment to running a network that’s appealing to brands, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Not everyone is convinced that Musk’s hopes for loosening content moderation will negatively impact Twitter’s bottom line.

Michael Cohen, executive vice president of Performance Media at Horizon Media, pointed to the #StopHateForProfit boycott that was organized by several civil rights groups in July 2020, mostly on Meta Platforms Inc. apps. The organizers urged companies to stop paying for ads on Facebook and Instagram to protest the platform’s handling of hate speech and misinformation. Of more than 9 million advertisers who bought ad space on Facebook, only about 1,000 publicly joined the boycott and the resulting impact on the company’s revenue was negligible.

“With the Meta boycott, we saw some advertisers come off the platform for a couple of months before moving right back on,” said Cohen.

Although Twitter’s advertising business is dwarfed by that of other major digital players, advertising dollars accounted for over 92% of its first-quarter revenue.

“Will advertisers move away from Twitter if Elon Musk owns it?” Mark DiMassimo, founder and creative chief of agency DiGo, asked rhetorically. “Not if they can still get good reach and frequency and a good audience.”

Twitter will try to make that case at the NewFronts, at least.

When it comes to recessions and profiting from an economic crisis, there is perhaps no other hedge fund manager on Wall Street that commands as much attention as Michael Burry, the chief of Scion Asset Management, a hedge fund with a portfolio value of $74 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Burry is a legendary investor who made record profits in the financial meltdowns of 2000 and 2008, accurately predicting the dotcom and housing crashes. As a recession looms large over the market again, Burry is once again in the spotlight.

The latest Burry saga begins in early 2021, just as the stock market was booming in light of easing virus restrictions and the reopening of the economy. Burry had warned that the boom was only temporary, predicting the “mother of all crashes” and comparing the soaring valuations in the technology sector to the dotcom and housing bubbles. He proceeded to repeat the same warnings through the year. His hedge fund activity was reflective of his thoughts as well as he reduced the stocks in the Scion portfolio from 20 to just 6 in the third quarter of 2021.

In late 2021, as inflation soared due to supply chain problems and increased demand for goods and services, the central bank hinted at raising the interest rate to curb skyrocketing prices. This led to a mass sell-off in the technology sector at the turn of the year. As the Fed prepares for even more rate hikes in 2022, several market experts are now predicting that the economy could go into a deep recession by 2023. Burry has said that the Fed has “no intention of fighting inflation” and the rate hikes are “getting elevation before stocks and the consumer tap out”.

Burry Cheers Musk, Warns of Great Depression

The chief of Scion Asset Management, who held large stakes in companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), and Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:DISCA) during the past year, also addressed famous tech-related names like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) in his tweets. In a series of tweets, which have been deleted in typical Burry fashion merely hours after they were sent, the hedge fund manager noted that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) rivals would catch up to the firm, pointing to Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) as an example to back his assertion.

Story continues

Streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported disappointing first quarter earnings last month and also disclosed that it was losing subscribers, sending a shockwave down the entertainment industry and leading to a dramatic drop in the share price. Burry claimed that the “the competition came for Netflix just like the competition is coming for Tesla” in a tweet. Burry had shorted hundreds of millions worth of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock last year and engaged in a public battle with Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) founder Elon Musk. The latter referred to the former as a “broken clock” in a tweet in November 2021.

More recently, Burry has cheered on Musk and his recent decision to purchase social networking platform Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR). In a since deleted tweet from late April, Burry said that “Musk taking control of Twitter after pledging to prioritize free speech would be good for the US” and that Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) had previously “restricted the sharing of disputed news reports that were later verified”. Burry has also compared the bulls at the market to the reporters sharing positive news about the stock market a day before it crashed, leading to the Great Depression of the 1929.

114,GM has 4 new plants coming to 'have control over battery cell manufacture': Mary Barra,"In the years ahead, GM (GM) says, it's aiming to be a leading manufacturer of batteries as well as cars.

“For electric vehicles, it's all about the battery,” CEO Mary Barra told Yahoo Finance in a wide-ranging interview this week.

The CEO outlined plans to open at least four new plants just to manufacture batteries that power the company's electric vehicles.

“We decided that we wanted to have control over battery cell manufacture so we formed a joint venture with LG, one of our partners, and we now have a plant coming online this year in Ohio, another one coming online next year, the following year, and one after that,” she says. Mary Barra announces an investment of more than $7 billion in four Michigan manufacturing sites in January, including a new Ultium Cells battery cell plant in Lansing. (JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images)

The collaboration with LG Energy Solution, called Ultium Cells, will power more and more GM vehicles in the years ahead. They have three locations under construction. A Warren, Ohio plant will begin production this August; a Spring Hill, Tennessee location is set to follow in 2023 and one in Lansing, Michigan begins in 2024. The Michigan plant alone is a $2.6 billion investment. According to GM, a fourth plant whose location has yet to be announced will be up and running in 2025.

The ambitious plans come as the company tries to catch up with EV industry leaders like Tesla (TSLA). Elon Musk's company, the world's largest EV maker, has manufactured its own batteries for years and says its Nevada gigafactory became the highest-volume battery plant in the world back in 2018. Tesla also says it produces more batteries — measured by kWh — than all other carmakers combined.

‘Going all the way up to the supply chain’

GM's effort is part of a broader push across the U.S. economy to pivot to clean energy while not trading dependence on oil for another asset, specifically the precious minerals that fuel batteries and much of modern life but are often either mined or processed in places like Russia and Ukraine as well as China.

The White House got involved in the effort this week, announcing over $3 billion to help companies like GM and others with the battery shortage.

Story continues

A Biden official behind the effort noted to Yahoo Finance Monday that automakers will be a key beneficiary. The efforts from Washington will “feed into those [GM] plants, making the advanced materials needed for those plants as inputs, and going all the way up to the supply chain of developing the advanced minerals that are needed for these plants,” says David Howell, acting director at the Department of Energy's Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains.

A GM spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that the company, which has close ties with the Biden White House, ""is actively pursuing opportunities to localize as much of the EV and battery supply chain as possible and, as such, we are reviewing the battery-related Funding Opportunity Announcements authorized by the U.S. Department of Energy under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)."" In a photo from 2020, the Ohio Ultium factory is shown under construction. It is scheduled to begin production this year. (MEGAN JELINGER/AFP via Getty Images)

‘We're not done yet’

President Joe Biden has set a goal of having half of the cars sold in the U.S. by 2030 be electric; GM has set a similar benchmark, saying it also wants 100% of its light-duty vehicles to be electric by 2035.

The batteries that will power these vehicles currently run on components like lithium and nickel. The White House recently invoked the Defense Production Act — allowing the president to force businesses to take actions — to build up domestic production capability. In effect, it’s likely to mean more mining of these metals in the U.S.

For her part, Barra also underlines the significant job creation GM's effort will entail. Speaking of the jobs set to be created, she said, “roughly every battery plant is around 1,100 to 1,200 people.”

She added, “We're not done yet.”

The higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S. would be outweighed by the supply chain security and the convenience factor, she said.

“When you think about the logistics piece of it, having it close to where we're actually building the vehicle or assembling the battery pack is an advantage,” she said.

115,‘Seems kinda fungible’: Elon Musk changes Twitter profile picture to Bored Ape Yacht Club collage in perceived ‘troll’ to NFT community,"Elon Musk has changed his Twitter profile picture to a collage of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs.

“I dunno…seems kinda fungible,” Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted on Wednesday, poking fun at a major hallmark of the non-fungible token, or NFT concept—that they are unique and cannot be replicated.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1521807738317066240?s=20

It doesn’t appear that Musk owns any of these NFTs but might be poking fun at the Bored Ape community. A common critique is that anyone can just copy or screenshot an NFT online and save it without buying it.

The collage that Musk posted, which seems to have been taken from the Sotheby’s “Ape In!” NFT auction from September 2021, shows one main Bored Ape against a backdrop of several smaller Bored Apes.

Michael Bouhanna, vice president, contemporary art specialist, and cohead of digital art at Sotheby’s, asked Musk on Twitter to remove the profile picture (pfp) or give him credit.

“@Elonmusk as much as I admire your work I’d like you to remove your pfp that I created for our Sotheby’s sale. Or you credit me 😂. Happy to send you the original file minted with the buyer approval,” Bouhanna tweeted.

https://twitter.com/michaelbouhanna/status/1521799776630628353

Musk frequently reposts memes of sorts, but some have criticized his reposting, as he often neglects to give the original meme creators credit.

https://twitter.com/ParikPatelCFA/status/1521812214482673669?s=20

The reactions to Musk’s new Bored Ape collage avatar from Crypto Twitter were mixed. Some found it funny. Others interpreted it as genuine support for the NFT collection, and others were just confused.

“Elon Musk literally made a collage of screenshotted bored apes his profile pic to troll NFT owners,” one Twitter user tweeted.

Musk has appeared to mock NFTs in the past. In December 2021 he tweeted a meme saying, ""These ‘NFTs’—are they in the room with us right now?”

In January 2022, Musk called Twitter's decision to include NFT profile pictures “annoying,” adding, “Twitter is spending engineering resources on this bs while crypto scammers are throwing a spambot block party in every thread!?”

ApeCoin, the cryptocurrency associated with Bored Apes, has popped slightly today after a rough week following Yuga Labs’ metaverse land sale. ApeCoin is up 2.1% in 24 hours, now trading at $15.51, according to CoinGecko.

124,Elon Musk plans eventual Twitter IPO after takeover,"Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley discusses Elon Musk's potential plans for Twitter.

Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Well, we know Elon Musk plans to take Twitter private once the deal is officially closed. But now the Tesla CEO reportedly telling potential Twitter investors that he could make it public again in just a few years. That's at least according to a report out from the Wall Street Journal.

Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley with me here at the desk. So, Dan, it's not unusual for companies-- for CEOs, we should say-- who acquire a company, take it private to restructure, and then go public again. What more do we know about the plans Elon Musk has to restructure Twitter?

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, it's really still very much up in the air. This is something that he's basically kind of said, you know, I want to have less censorship, and dot, dot, dot. That's basically all we know so much as far as his plans for Twitter. And that's been an issue that I think a lot of people have taken kind of in one way or the other. Either it's going to be very good if you are a Elon Musk supporter, and you don't believe that there should be content moderation, or it's going to be very bad if you believe that there should be content moderation.

As far as what else he wants to do, he says he's wanted to kind of-- at one point-- he's speaking out of both sides of his mouth here. At one point, he said it's not about making money. On the other side, he said he's going to improve revenue and has potential ideas for that, such as charging for quote tweeting or things along those lines. And that just seems untenable to me. I don't know how much more they could kind of get out of Twitter outside of being very ad-focused or going towards a subscription model. And they do have a small subscription service right now.

He has said, Elon Musk, that he wants to get away from the advertising revenue model, which I don't know how that's supposed to help the company. But that seems to be really his plans for now. I mean, look, this is a company that's not nearly as big as TikTok or Snap or anywhere close to Facebook. And it really is one where engagement isn't as intense as something like a Facebook and Instagram, a TikTok. It's, you see someone's little post. And then that's it. You kind of move on, unless there's a very long thread. So I don't know how he's going to get more out of this.

Story continues

AKIKO FUJITA: Well, there were those reports that he is considering charging some companies, as well as lawmakers, to use the platform, too. I mean, how much of that can be a revenue driver if you're not going to go through an advertising model?

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I mean, and that's not going to be a massive, massive amount of users, right? So I think part of it is trying to get-- Twitter is just very opaque to begin with, right? If you're an early user, it's hard to figure out how it works. And I think that was part of Snap's original problem. They've seemed to work that out. Twitter just never really did. And so it's still a difficult service to get your head around, especially when it comes to uploading images, things like that. The lack of being able to edit, again, that's a big problem, though that seems to be something that Twitter says they're working on and will soon introduce.

But I do think that it's still just a service that isn't really-- it doesn't really resonate with very many people, whereas something like a TikTok or an Instagram does. The algorithm is the algorithm. The feed is the feed. It's just going to be that way.

AKIKO FUJITA: Well, TikTok just seems like a happier place to be, right?

DAN HOWLEY: It depends on where you are.

AKIKO FUJITA: I guess my algorithm is a happy one. Did I hear that you're getting off Twitter? Is that what I heard this morning?

DAN HOWLEY: I'm not getting off Twitter. I'm getting off Instagram. 20-minute limit every day. And I'm not even on Facebook--

AKIKO FUJITA: It never works. I've got a 10-minute limit. I get the warning, and then I just keep watching.

DAN HOWLEY: I deleted TikTok five times.

AKIKO FUJITA: I think there are bigger issues we need to talk about, Dan. Dan Howley, thanks so much for that.",2022-05-04T15:56:47+00:00

* Starbucks rises on robust U.S. demand

* All eyes on Fed policy statement at 2 p.m. ET

* Indexes down: Dow 0.26%, S&P 0.57%, Nasdaq 1.47% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Devik Jain and Bansari Mayur Kamdar

May 4 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Wednesday as a rise in U.S. Treasury yields hit growth stocks ahead of a widely expected interest-rate hike that could be the biggest since 2000.

Six of the 11 major S&P sectors rose, with energy and utilities leading the gains.

Bank stocks were up 0.3% after U.S. Treasury two-year yields, the most sensitive to the Federal Reserve's interest rate outlook, soared to their highest since Nov 2018. The benchmark 10-year yield topped 3% for a third consecutive day.

Strengthening yields continued to haunt megacap growth stocks. Microsoft Corp, Google-parent Alphabet Inc , Meta Platforms, Tesla, Amazon.com and Nvidia fell between 1.5% and 4.1% and weighed on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

""There is this expectation that the Fed is going to be raising (rates) by 50 basis points and that they're going to start providing more color on winding down their balance sheet,"" said Michelle Cluver, portfolio strategist at Global X ETFs.

""This is all leading to more pressure on growth equities and putting upward pressure on your 10-year treasury yields.""

Fed policymakers have widely telegraphed a double-barreled decision that would lift the Fed's short-term target policy rate to a range between 0.75% and 1%, and set in motion a plan to trim its $9 trillion balance sheet.

The policy statement is due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).

The spotlight will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's news conference for fresh clues on how far and how fast the central bank is prepared to go in an effort to bring down decades-high inflation.

Concerns about a hit to economic growth due to a hawkish Fed, mixed earnings from some big growth companies, the conflict in Ukraine and pandemic-related lockdowns in China have hammered Wall Street recently, with richly valued growth stocks bearing the brunt of the sell-off.

""There's still a lot of uncertainty in the economy, and you're also seeing slowing economic growth and headwinds globally that could adversely affect earnings and stocks going forward. I'm not yet willing to say it's the bottom, but we have come down quite a lot,"" Cluver said.

Two separate sets of data showed private employers hired the fewest workers in two years last month, while expansion in the services sector unexpectedly lost some momentum in April.

At 11:38 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 86.54 points, or 0.26%, at 33,042.25, the S&P 500 was down 23.62 points, or 0.57%, at 4,151.86, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 184.93 points, or 1.47%, at 12,378.83.

Starbucks Corp gained 5.5% after the coffee chain saw quarterly comparable sales grow 12% in North America.

Livent Corp surged 21.2% after it posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit and bolstered its 2022 revenue outlook on higher demand for lithium used in electric vehicle batteries.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.03-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.46-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and 37 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 22 new highs and 297 new lows. (Reporting by Devik Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Anil D'Silva)",2022-05-04T16:25:23+00:00

132,UPDATE 3-U.S. House Republican says Musk/Twitter records must be preserved by FTC,"(Adds detail from letter, context)

By Diane Bartz

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - Representative Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, asked the chair of the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday to preserve its records related to Elon Musk's pending acquisition of Twitter Inc.

The request indicates that Jordan may investigate the FTC's merger review.

Jordan expressed concern about statements by the Open Markets Institute, which he called ""an extreme left-wing political advocacy organization,"" and its call for the FTC to stop the deal.

""We are concerned that OMI - where you were previously employed as Legal Director - may be trying to leverage its close relationship with you to take action to further limit free speech online,"" wrote Jordan.

FTC Chair Lina Khan was legal director from 2017-2018 at the OMI, which describes itself on its website as working ""to address threats to our democracy, individual liberties, and our national security from today's unprecedented levels of corporate concentration and monopoly power.""

Jordan has backed Musk's purchase of Twitter in hopes that some conservatives, like former President Donald Trump, who were removed from the social media platform would be able to return.

The OMI issued a statement https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/publications/open-markets-details-how-us-government-can-block-musk-takeover-of-twitter?rq=twitter last month on how it said the government could block the purchase of Twitter.

There is little expectation that Musk's potential purchase of Twitter will be rejected by antitrust enforcers.

In the letter, Jordan asked if Khan or anyone else at the FTC had helped draft the Open Markets statement. And he asked if the agency had taken any action regarding the statement. He asked for a reply by 5 p.m. on May 18.

Musk, the world's richest man and an active and opinionated Twitter user, clinched a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion cash in late April.

Story continues

While Musk has tweeted about free speech, when he discusses his plans for Twitter they are focused more on helping the company make more money by getting more people to use it or cutting expenses like executive pay. He has said nothing publicly about allowing banned former users to return.

The FTC is reportedly investigating Musk's initial purchase of a 9% stake in Twitter, probing whether he complied with an antitrust reporting requirement when he acquired the shares in early April.

The FTC acknowledged receiving Jordan's letter but declined further comment. Tesla, the electric vehicle company of which Musk is CEO, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The OMI could not be reached immediately for comment. (Reporting by Diane Bartz and David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler and Richard Pullin)",2022-05-04T18:33:21+00:00
133,JPMorgan lawsuit against Tesla unlikely to yield quick ruling,"By Luc Cohen

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday said he saw no reason to rule quickly in favor of JPMorgan Chase & Co as it sues Tesla Inc over Elon Musk's 2018 tweet that he might take the electric car company private.

JPMorgan sued Tesla for $162.2 million in November 2021, saying Tesla breached a 2014 contract related to stock warrants it sold to the bank, and which JPMorgan believes became more valuable because of Musk's tweet.

Warrants give the holder the right to buy a company's stock at a set ""strike"" price and date.

Judge Paul Gardephe of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York said at a hearing in Manhattan that he was unlikely to rule for JPMorgan without more evidence, including from financial experts, about whether the bank acted in good faith.

""Expert testimony regarding the custom in the industry appears necessary,"" Gardephe said.

JPMorgan said it was obligated to reprice the warrants after Musk's notorious tweet, and that a subsequent ten-fold increase in Tesla's stock price required that company to make payments, which it has not done.

Tesla countersued JPMorgan in January, accusing the bank of seeking a ""windfall"" when it re-priced the warrants.

JPMorgan has yet to formally seek a quick ruling. Lawrence Portnoy, a lawyer for the bank, said at the hearing he disagreed with Gardephe's assessment and thought JPMorgan could make a convincing case.

Jonathan Pickhardt, a lawyer for Tesla, said Gardephe shouldn't rule without first hearing from experts on JPMorgan's actions.

He also said the tweet was a ""personal statement made by Mr. Musk"" and not a statement by Tesla, limiting the company's responsibility.

Musk's tweets resulted in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission obtaining $20 million in civil fines against both him and Tesla.

Musk, the world's richest person, inked a deal to buy Twitter Inc for $44 billion last week.

Chinese technology platform company Pinduoduo Inc – ADR (NASDAQ:PDD), which is down 50% in the past 6 months, was also sold entirely by Cathie Wood’s hedge fund in the first quarter of 2022. In April, Goldman Sachs analyst Ronald Keung assumed coverage of Pinduoduo Inc – ADR (NASDAQ:PDD) with a Buy rating and $95 price target. In March, Pinduoduo Inc – ADR (NASDAQ:PDD) fell after it reported lackluster fourth quarter performance. Revenue in the period came in at $4.27 billion, below the consensus forecast of $4.68 billion.

Hedge funds were turning bearish on Pinduoduo Inc – ADR (NASDAQ:PDD) amid Chinese crackdown on tech companies. At the end of the fourth quarter, 34 funds in our database had stakes in the company, down from 49 funds a quarter earlier. Hedge funds are instead focusing on mainstream tech stocks like Tesla Inc.

Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is yet another tech stock losing value amid uncertainty around growth stocks in the market. The stock is down 44% in the last 6 months. Snap Inc.

Fed Hikes Rates Half-Point as Powell Signals Similar Moves Ahead Russia Seeks to Annex Occupied Ukraine as Invasion Goals Shift As Putin Gets Desperate, U.S. Should Remember Pearl Harbor Biden’s Team Eyes $125,000 Income Cutoff for Student Loan Relief India Wants Russia to Discount Its Oil to Below $70 a Barrel

Bitcoin staged its biggest rally in nearly two months after the Federal Reserve quashed fears it will make jumbo-sized moves on interest-rate policy.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency rose as much as 5.9% to $40,007 in New York trading, while other digital assets including Ether and Litecoin also rallied. The move follows comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said the central bank wasn’t looking to increase rates by 75 basis points at its upcoming meetings, quelling fears it would move super-aggressively to tamp down inflation.

The relatively less-hawkish tone of the comments “contributes to speculative appetite, which is likely to be bullish for crypto,” said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive of FRNT Financial Inc.

The U.S. central bank’s policy-making Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday voted unanimously to increase the benchmark rate by a half percentage point and said it will begin allowing its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to roll off in June. Risky assets surged after Powell said a 75-basis point increase is “not something that the committee is actively considering.”

Still, in this higher-rate environment, Bitcoin hasn’t been able to break out in any meaningful way beyond its highs at the start of the year. The coin has largely traded within a tight range over the past few months.

“The market is basically stuck in a range,” Dan Gunsberg, co-founder of Hxro Network, said by phone.

Money has been flowing out of the sector amid the malaise. Investors yanked roughly $120 million from crypto products last week, bringing total outflows over the past four weeks to $339 million, according to data tracked by fund provider CoinShares. Bitcoin last week accounted for the majority of the flows in what was its largest single week of outflows since June 2021.

Elsewhere, data from CoinGecko shows that the price of ApeCoin, the native crypto token of Yuga Labs’ APE ecosystem, was up 10% as of 4:10 p.m. in New York Wednesday after Elon Musk changed his Twitter display picture to that of a collage of Bored Apes.

Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection of NFTs, recently led a sale of virtual land on “Otherside,” its metaverse project. The sale raised $320 million but also led to huge congestion and high transaction fees on the Ethereum network.

The token price of ApeCoin fell from its Sunday highs of $22 to $14.50 per token on Wednesday before jumping to $17.16 after the Tesla CEO -- and Twitter acquirer -- changed his profile picture.

140,UPDATE 1-Albemarle lifts annual outlook on robust lithium demand,"(Updates with industry background, details from the results, outlook)

May 4 (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp, one of the world's biggest producers of lithium, raised its full-year forecasts on Wednesday after quarterly profit more than doubled on strong demand for the metal used in electric-vehicle batteries.

Shares of the company jumped 16% in extended trading.

Lithium's central role in the production of electric-vehicle batteries has made it a coveted commodity as global efforts to decarbonize automobiles gather pace. That has pushed up prices of the metal to record highs in a boost for producers.

Yet demand is expected to outstrip supply, with Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk saying last month that lithium is ""a limiting factor"" in the growth of EVs.

Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle posted a net income of $253.4 million, or $2.15 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, compared with $95.7 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier.

The company said it now expects full-year net sales to come between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion, compared with an earlier forecast of $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion.

It also raised its annual adjusted profit outlook to between $9.25 and $12.25 per share, from $5.65 per share to $6.65 per share.

142,APE Joins DOGE to Take Cues From Crypto Influencer Elon Musk,"Key Insights:

On Wednesday, Elon Musk briefly changed his Twitter profile image to a Bored Ape Yacht Club image, driving APECoin (APE) into a frenzy. Musk has a similar impact on Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB), and even Bitcoin (BTC). The Elon Musk influence brings into question the ethos of decentralization.

Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, is no stranger to cryptos. In January 2021, the Tesla (TSLA) CEO showed his power over the crypto market by simply changing his Twitter account description to #bitcoin.

On January 29, the Bitcoin (BTC) response was evident, surging from a day low of $31,996 to a day high of $38,632 before easing back. Hourly chart shows the influence of Elon Musk.

In February of last year, Musk delivered further BTC price action with news of Tesla acquiring $1.5bn in BTC. Once more, the Musk influence was evident, with BTC responding to the news. BTC spikes on news of Tesla purchasing $1.5bn in BTC.

Since then, Musk has continued to show his influence on the crypto market, with DOGE, SHIB, and now APE at the mercy of Musk’s Twitter account.

Musk Twitter Account Causes APECoin Frenzy

On Wednesday, Elon Musk flexed his crypto muscles via his heavily influential Twitter account. By simply changing his Twitter profile picture to a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT image, APECoin surged from $14.51 to a day high of $17.64 before easing back. APE holders enjoyed a 21% breakout within a 45-minute time span. Musk Twitter account hits APE

APE joined a growing list of cryptos that have fallen under Elon Musk’s spell. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB) have long been under the influence of Elon Musk.

APE Joins Dogecoin as an Elon Musk Dependent

Over the last 12-months, Musk’s influence on DOGE and SHIB has been unquestionable. Last month alone, DOGE investors faced heightened volatility as the global financial markets responded to Musk’s Twitter purchase.

On April 5 and April 25, two spikes were evidence of the Musk Spell. The April 5 breakout came in response to news of Musk taking a $3bn stake in Twitter.

The April 25 breakout came in response to renewed talk of Musk buying Twitter, which briefly took DOGE into the crypto top 10 by market cap.

Story continues Price spikes driven by Musk news updates.

Musk Brings into Question the Ethos of Decentralization

Since Tesla’s purchase of $1.5bn in BTC, questions have surfaced over the influence of one person on the crypto market.

There has yet to be any regulatory scrutiny on the Musk influence despite the SEC’s stance on cryptos.

For the crypto market, the Musk influence raises questions over the ethos of decentralization. The impact of a Musk Tweet on APE, BTC, DOGE, and even SHIB removes the concept of decentralization.

While crypto investors going long may appreciate the Musk influence, investors shorting APE, DOGE, and SHIB walk a treacherous path, with Musk able to create a price spike with a simple tweet.

Their discussion was sparked by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who said firms like BlackRock Inc. have outsized voices in many corporations because of the voting power of their stable of passive index trackers.

Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., replied that passive investing has “gone too far.” Wood, who founded Ark Investment Management LLC, took up the conversation, noting that investors in S&P 500 trackers would have missed out on big gains in Tesla before it was included in that index.

“History will deem the accelerated shift toward passive funds during the last 20 years as a massive misallocation of capital,” Wood said.

Wood is one of the most high-profile active managers but has suffered a bruising year, with her flagship ARK Innovation ETF slumping almost 45%. Tesla, meanwhile, is among the major companies where the likes of indexing pioneer Vanguard Group or BlackRock are among the top shareholders.

The debate over active and passive funds has raged for decades. Active managers tout their performance potential and role in creating the efficient markets tracked by passive funds. Others say active styles struggle to beat indexes consistently and levy high fees compared with cheap trackers.

Analysts see more than 60% upside for the payments company, while shares in its bigger rival, PayPal Holdings Inc., have a return potential of 31%, according to Bloomberg data. At the same time, Block shares are by no means cheap, trading at 76 times estimated earnings and dwarfing PayPal’s valuation at 22 times.

The high price tag means that the company, formerly called Square, needs to deliver when it reports first-quarter results after the close today. Analysts at Jefferies said more clarity is needed around future growth for Block’s consumer payments service, Cash App, and around the impact of its $29 billion acquisition of Afterpay.

The set-up into results is “tricky,” with consensus estimates for Cash App “looking stretched” beyond the first quarter, and the profit drag from the Afterpay deal not fully reflected in expectations, analyst Trevor Williams wrote in a note. Still, Williams said that despite these near-term bumps, he’s bullish on the long-term opportunity. He has a buy rating on the stock.

So far, investors seem willing to pay out for Block’s growth potential. The company led by former Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has expanded meaningfully from a simple point-of-sale firm into digital payments and crytocurrencies with Cash App, and into the buy-now, pay-later space with the Afterpay deal, which closed in January.

Block has evolved “into a full business management and fintech service company,” Tigress Financial Partners LLC analyst Ivan Feinseth said. “They’re going beyond the payment.”

Story continues

That diversification also means that some investors prefer Block over PayPal, which is still highly reliant on e-commerce transactions.

Block has “executed admirably” over the past 6-9 months compared with PayPal, which experienced “several operational missteps” that hurt revenue growth, according to SMBC Nikko Securities America analyst Andrew Bauch, who has a buy-equivalent rating on Block. The stock has 42 buy ratings, 8 holds and 2 sell recommendations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Bauch added that Block isn’t pricey when looking at its long-term prospects. “When compared to other fintech names with similar levels of gross profit growth, the stock appears much more affordable,” he said.

Investors like Cathie Wood have also remained bullish. Wood’s Ark Fintech Innovation ETF dumped shares in PayPal after the company’s fourth-quarter results, while adding exposure to Block at the same time.

Still, the fintech favorite hasn’t been immune to recent market turmoil, falling about 34% this year. And, even if it jumps 60% to hit analyst targets, that level is still lower than last year’s record high.

The commitments come as the Tesla Inc. billionaire marshals capital to bankroll one of the biggest tech industry takeovers. The investors named in the filing on Thursday include crypto exchange Binance, Brookfield, Fidelity Management & Research, and Qatar Holding.

Musk has also won the support of fellow entrepreneur and Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, who has a big stake in Tesla and a seat on its board. Ellison’s trust has committed $1 billion to finance Musk’s takeover.

Twitter shares rose 2.5% in pre-market trading.

The world’s wealthiest person reached an agreement on April 25 to acquire Twitter using a financing plan that’s alarmed some Tesla investors. In addition to pledging tens of billions of dollars worth of his Tesla shares to support margin loans, Musk vowed to line up some $21 billion worth of equity. It’s been unclear how much of that would come from selling a portion of his Tesla stake. Musk has sold more than $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to finance the deal.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of the board at Kingdom Holding Company and one of Twitter’s largest backers, has now agreed to roll over his current investment. He previously rejected Musk’s bid, stating that it failed to come “close to the intrinsic value of Twitter.”

Musk is also in discussions with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on contributing some of his shares toward the acquisition. A previously announced margin loan committed toward the deal was reduced to an aggregate principal amount of $6.25 billion from $12.5 billion.

He previously rejected Musk’s bid, stating that it failed to come “close to the intrinsic value of Twitter.”

Musk is also in discussions with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on contributing some of his shares toward the acquisition.

Musk’s latest backers includes a bevy of traditional asset managers, venture capital firms, boutique hedge funds, and one of the world’s largest pools of capital. Qatar Holding, a unit of the nation’s wealth fund, has agreed to commit $375 million.

Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has publicly feuded with Dorsey on Twitter, has agreed to commit $400 million via his fund A16Z. Fellow venture firm Sequoia Capital is putting up double that, with $800 million.

Smaller investors include Witkoff Capital, the real estate-backed family office, and Cartenna Capital, a hedge fund set up by Peter Avellone, a former Millennium Management portfolio manager.

“In this game of high stakes poker, Ellison and the impressive list of backers will remove more of an overhang from Tesla shares as the Musk leverage of shares now becomes less onerous,” said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush. “This was a smart financial and strategic move by Musk that will be well received across the board.”

The new equity allows Musk to cut the size of the margin loan he previously struck with an array of investment banks, down to an aggregate principal amount of $6.25 billion from $12.5 billion.

It remains unclear how much of that would come from selling a portion of his Tesla stake. Musk has sold more than $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to finance the deal.

Elon Musk has raised $7.1bn of the $44bn he needs to take full control of Twitter, including a $1bn commitment from Oracle’s Larry Ellison.

New filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission show Mr Musk has the financial backing of Mr Ellison, who is on Tesla’s board, as well as tech investment firm Andreesen Horowitz and cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

Mr Musk’s previous $12.5bn margin loan, secured against his Tesla shares, has been halved to $6.25bn.

Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of Twitter’s largest current shareholders, has also agreed to back the deal if he retains his $1.8bn stake in Twitter.

The prince was an early opponent of the buyout, saying last month he did not believe that Mr Musk’s bid properly valued Twitter “given its growth prospects … I reject this offer”.

He tweeted on Thursday: “I believe you will be an excellent leader for @Twitter to propel & maximise its great potential. @Kingdom_KHC & I look forward to roll our ~$1.9bn in the ‘new’ @Twitter and join you on this exciting journey”.

Twitter shares rose more than 2pc in pre-market trading to $50.18.

Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities praised Mr Musk for having made a “smart financial and strategic move”, saying: “This speaks to our thesis that once Musk secured and won the Twitter bid he would seek financing from [private equity] and other players to reduce his burden on the $44bn.”

The buyout of Twitter rests on Mr Musk’s ability to raise enough cash to purchase the San Francisco-based company.

His maximum liability if the deal falls through is $1bn, as revealed in previous regulatory filings - a sum said to be considerably less than any other corporate suitor would face.

Mr Musk also revealed he is in continuing talks with Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, about raising finance.

The two have exchanged supportive messages on the social media site itself about changing Twitter's content moderation policies.

Twitter is worth about $39bn, down from March 2021’s high of $62bn.

The Tesla Inc. co-founder won over the Saudi price who initially balked at his offer and brought aboard Larry Ellison, the 11th richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He also got a half-billion-dollar commitment from cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

Musk, 50, also got hundreds of millions of dollars from Sequoia Capital, a big backer of his Space Exploration Technologies Corp., and Vy Capital, which has previously invested in his Boring Co. and Neuralink.

There might be more money to come. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, whose stake is worth about $1 billion, is continuing to have discussions about keeping his holdings in the company, according to a Thursday regulatory filing.

Here are the large investors throwing big money behind Musk’s Twitter bid.

Saudi Arabia Prince Alwaleed bin Talal: $1.9 Billion

Alwaleed has pledged to roll over his nearly 35 million Twitter shares, according to Thursday’s filing, which are worth about $1.9 billion at a price of $54.20 per share.

With a $16.4 billion fortune, he’s the richest individual in Saudi Arabia, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Most of his wealth is derived from his 95% ownership of Kingdom Holding Co.

He initially rejected Musk’s bid, saying the deal didn’t “come close to the intrinsic value” of the popular social-media platform. The move prompted a rapid retort from Musk, who asked how many shares the investor held in Twitter and the Kingdom’s view on freedom of speech for journalists.

Larry Ellison: $1 Billion

Ellison has made a fortune from Tesla. His stake in the electric carmaker is worth more than $14 billion. He was already one of the world’s richest people after founding Oracle Corp. He has a $95.6 billion fortune, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Sequoia Capital: $800 Million

Sequoia Capital has been a major backer of Musk’s SpaceX and the links between the billionaire and some people at the firm go back a long time. Sequoia partner Roelof Botha was chief financial officer at PayPal Holdings Inc. when Musk was its CEO two decades ago.

Vy Capital: $700 Million

Vy Capital is a Dubai-based tech investment firm. Its website says it has “a focus on category-defining technology companies with the potential to meaningfully impact humanity.” It has previously invested in Musk’s ventures, including Neuralink and Boring Co.

Binance: $500 Million

This is the second high-profile investment in a media company for Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The firm, founded by billionaire Changpeng Zhao, has also invested in Forbes.

AH Capital Management: $400 Million

AH Capital is the investment advisor of A16Z and was co-founded by prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. Since Musk announced his plan to buy Twitter, Andreessen has encouraged the move, engaging with Musk on the social-media platform and even changing his biography to “shadow crew,” a jab at a Wall Street Journal article about those behind the scenes who encouraged the takeover.

Qatar Holding: $375 Million

Qatar, fittingly for Musk, is the world’s richest country per capita. It has a $450 billion sovereign-wealth fund that is seeking to diversify the country’s money by plowing into Asia and the U.S. after investing in Europe. The Qatar Investment Authority is the world’s ninth-largest sovereign-wealth fund, according to SWF Institute data.

Aliya Capital Partners: $360 Million

Miami-based Aliya, led by CEO Ari Shrage, has investments in companies it deems innovative and disruptive. Late last year, it was part of a $125 million Series B funding round for Kodiak Robotics, a self-driving truck startup.

Fidelity Management & Research: $316.14 Million

Musk is also getting backing from some large U.S. institutional investors. Boston-based Fidelity Investments, led by Chief Executive Officer Abigail Johnson, ended 2021 with $4.5 trillion of discretionary assets.

Brookfield: $250 Million

Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management oversees about $700 billion. CEO Bruce Flatt said recently in an interview with David Rubenstein that his key to success is to encourage employees to make small mistakes every day, “just don’t make any really large mistakes.”

Strauss Capital: $150 Million

Strauss is a New York-based investment banking firm founded by Tom Strauss, a former co-head of the mergers and acquisitions group at Barclays Plc’s U.S. investment-banking arm.

$100 Million or Less: BAMCO, DFJ Growth, Witkoff Capital, A.M. Management & Consulting, Honeycomb Asset Management, Key Wealth Advisers, Litani Ventures, Tresser Blvd 402

Musk secured investments from several other firms, in denominations of as little as $5 million.

He’s still looking for more investors. He “will continue to have, discussions with certain existing holders of Common Stock (including Jack Dorsey) regarding the possibility of contributing such shares of Common Stock to Parent, at or immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, in order to retain an equity investment in Twitter following completion of the Merger,” according to Thursday’s filing.

The alternative asset manager’s Brookfield Growth division piled $250 million into Musk’s $7.1 billion equity raise for the deal, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday.

The check is the largest ever for the venture capital arm and a little out of step from the late-stage funding it typically provides to private tech companies -- at much smaller sums, according to a person familiar with the matter. Brookfield raised $500 million for the growth fund last November.

The financing for Musk stems from a long-standing relationship between the billionaire and Canada’s largest alternative asset manager, the person said, asking not to be identified because the details aren’t public.

A representative for Brookfield declined to comment, while a representative for Musk wasn’t immediately available for comment.

Not only is Brookfield invested in Musk’s the Boring Co., but the two are partnered on a project to build a sustainable housing development in Austin, Texas.

Brookfield, Musk’s Tesla Energy and real estate developer Dacra announced the partnership, known as SunHouse at Easton Park, last year. The group said at the time that Tesla’s solar panels would be installed at the homes being developed at Brookfield’s Easton Park residential community.

168,GM CEO Mary Barra’s plan for overtaking Tesla,"GM (GM) CEO Mary Barra has made it her mission to surpass Elon Musk in EV manufacturing.

She promises that her 113-year-old company can pivot and take on Tesla (TSLA), the world's largest EV maker, making GM the eventual leader in that market as it's been in the past for internal-combustion powered cars.

“We're taking all the steps to do it,” she told Yahoo Finance in a wide-ranging interview this week. “We have said that by mid-decade, we will be selling more EVs in this country than anyone else, including Tesla.” Mary Barra, Chair and CEO of General Motors Company speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 2, 2022. REUTERS/Mike Blake

The ambitious plans are not likely to faze Musk publicly, who once mocked Barra on Twitter as living “in Cloud Cuckoo Land”, over the market share of their respective companies.

But Barra says she knows the strategy to do it: Cheaper electric vehicles.

“Remember, we're not necessarily just selling at the premium end” she said Monday, drawing a clear contrast to Tesla, whose cheapest model has an MSRP of $46,990. “We're going to have electric vehicles affordable at $30,000.”

Currently, the Chevy BOLT EV is listed as starting at $31,500, and a Silverado EV has an estimated MSRP of $39,900. Other electric cars in Barra’s lineup — like the Cadillac LYRIQ and the Hummer — are more clearly in the luxury space, with suggested MSRPs of $58,795 and 79,995, respectively.

The company also recently announced a partnership with Honda to further drive EV prices down via a series of affordable electric vehicles that are expected to go on sale in 2027.

“We've really worked to listen and understand what the customer is looking for,” Barra says.

Tesla has a clear head start on production and holds a distinct advantage in clean technology, however. In 2021, It remained the leader in the global EV market with a market share of nearly 14%. GM sits at in fourth at 7.6%.

Nonetheless, Barra professes confidence that she will eventually close the gap and surpass Musk, the world’s richest man.

She says each year more and more GM drivers will gradually trade in their internal-combustion vehicles for electric ones. “They are going to be buying electric trucks,” she said of current Chevy and GMC truck drivers in the years ahead.

“I think it's a little bit longer game,” she says.

176,"Bill Gates hits back at Elon Musk, says shorting Tesla doesn’t mean betting against the environment or electric cars","Responding to Elon Musk’s claims that he is shorting Tesla stock, Bill Gates says such a position is just an investment, not a move against helping solve climate change.

Elon Musk accused the Microsoft billionaire in a tweet last week of betting as much as half-a-billion dollars that shares of the electric-car company would fall.

In a text exchange between the two billionaires leaked online that Musk said was authentic, the Tesla CEO asked Gates if he was still shorting the stock. Gates said he was, and that he wanted to talk to Musk about philanthropy. Musk denied the request outright.

“Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change,” Musk reportedly said in the text exchange.

But Gates told the BBC in an interview Wednesday that his bet against Tesla is unrelated to advocacy for pro-environmental projects and government policies.

""That has nothing to do with climate change. I have ways of diversifying,” Gates said in an interview.

He added that just because he was betting against Tesla doesn’t mean he was against the rise of electric cars.

""The popularity of electric cars will lead to more competition for selling those cars. So there's a difference between electric cars being adopted, and companies becoming infinitely valuable,” he told the BBC.

Musk and Gates have a history of frosty relations, and Musk has attacked Gates on Twitter repeatedly.

After Gates said he was concerned about the range and premium price of Tesla vehicles in a 2020 video with YouTuber Marques Brownlee, Musk said in a tweet that his conversations with the former Microsoft CEO “have been underwhelming tbh.”

More recently, amid Musk’s takeover of Twitter, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO tweeted a picture of Gates side by side with an emoji of a pregnant man, saying, “in case u need to lose a boner fast.”

Gates told CNBC’s Squawk Box in July 2020 that Musk should cut back on his controversial vaccine comments and focus on electric cars and rockets. In a New York Times podcast later that year, the Tesla CEO responded to Gates’ comments about Musk’s lack of experience with vaccines, calling Gates a “knucklehead.” Musk has also attacked Gates in tweets regarding his vaccine advocacy.

Story continues

In a tweet last week, Musk said he was moving on from attacking Gates for shorting Tesla. But Gates appears unruffled.

""There’s no need for him to be nice to me,” Gates said of Musk in the BBC interview.

Disagreements and attacks between the two men have drawn outsize attention because of their immense wealth. Musk overtook Gates as the world’s second-richest person in 2020 and later surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to take the top spot. The Tesla CEO is currently the richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, while Gates sits at fourth on the list. Gates has pledged to give away most of his fortune over his lifetime.

177,NIO Stock: China’s Tesla Starts Sample Production on Model 3 Rival,"Chinese electric carmaker Nio (NYSE:NIO) is again in the news. It is producing cars at its newest production facility, NeoPark, in the province of Hefei. In September, the company will release its latest model, the ET5, and has started test production at the facility, and investors are watching to see how it affects NIO stock.

NeoPark will cover 4.4 square miles, and when it is complete, it will have a total capacity of a million vehicles and 100 gigawatt-hours of batteries. This is great news for NIO stock, which has struggled in the last six months and is down 49% in the year thus far.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The ET5 is touted as NIO’s answer to Tesla’s Model 3. The company’s latest release is an exciting one. It has an impressive range of 600 miles on a single charge and comes equipped with premium features that make it highly desirable in China. It will allow NIO to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the mainland’s premium electric vehicle (EV) segment and grow sales in an otherwise lackluster year.

The news comes at just the right time for NIO. Operations at the site began less than three weeks after work was suspended at the company’s first factory in Shanghai for five days. The suspension came as the result of supply chain issues.

Recently, there have been a few cases in which the coronavirus has demonstrated its potential to become even more invasive, with the worst spike in cases recorded since this virus first revealed itself. To combat this, Beijing has not only put in place strict policies to reduce infection of people but also stepped up lockdowns.

Currently, NIO stock is being hammered due to supply chain issues and lackluster delivery numbers. However, after falling so steeply, one cannot help but think of the company as a contrarian play.

NIO Stock Is a Buy After Steep Correction

The Chinese EV industry is struggling at the moment. The country has been trying to move away from its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and toward electric vehicles. However, the trade war with the U.S. and the recent geopolitical tensions are not helping matters.

Story continues

In addition, if the issues with Covid-19 weren’t enough, the country is now experiencing problems in managing supply chains.

Nio reported 5,074 EV deliveries in April. Nio had lower shipments in April than any other month in the year thus far.

However, not everything is negative.

Nio’s annual report shows that it had $8.3 billion in cash and investments at the end of last year. That means it will be able to continue operating smoothly during the Covid-19 situation. Nio has had to cut production since late March. It revealed in their annual filing that it has not yet been able to restart full operations.

The company confirmed its plans for international expansion, stating that it will be delivering the ET5 model starting in September. They plan to hit a couple of new markets in addition to China and Norway.

May 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reviewing Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover of Twitter Inc, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing a person familiar with the deal.

The FTC declined to comment, while Musk could not be reached for comment.

The agency will decide in the next month whether it will do an in-depth antitrust probe of the proposed transaction, the person told Bloomberg. Such a probe would delay the deal's closing by months.

Antitrust experts have said there is little likelihood the agency will find any evidence that Musk's purchase of Twitter is illegal under antitrust law.

The FTC is already investigating Musk's initial purchase of a 9% stake in Twitter, probing whether he complied with an antitrust reporting requirement when he acquired the shares in early April.

One critic of the deal has been Open Markets Institute, which said that it should be stopped to avoid giving an already powerful man ""direct control over one of the world's most important platforms for public communications and debate."" It also cited Musk's ownership of the satellite communications company Starlink as a concern.

The deal has the support of Republicans, who hope conservatives banned from the site, like former President Donald Trump, will be allowed to return.

While Musk has tweeted about free speech, when he discusses plans for Twitter he focuses more on helping revenues by getting more people to use it or cutting such expenses as executive pay. He has said nothing publicly about allowing banned former users to return.

181,There’s Nothing to Like About Lordstown Stock These Days,"Wall Street doesn’t seem to be taking the latest news about Lordstown Motors Corp. (NASDAQ:RIDE) stock well.

Lordstown on Monday announced that it’s pushing back its deal to sell its Ohio factory to Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (OTCMKTS:HNHPF), which operates as Foxconn. The deal was supposed to close by April 14, but the extension gives the parties until May 14 to complete the $230 million deal.

Foxconn already made $200 million in down payments toward the purchase, but the companies are still working on co-manufacturing and co-development agreements as part of the transaction, Lordstown says in a statement.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

If the deal doesn’t close by May 14, then Lordstown will have to give Foxconn its money back. That announcement was made April 29. Since then, RIDE stock is down nearly 8%.

7 Restaurant Stocks Ready for a 'Revenge Travel' Rally

It seems as if Wall Street is hedging its bets that the Foxconn deal will go through at all.

It’s really just another nail in the coffin for RIDE stock, which showed so much promise when it finalized its deal to go public with a special purpose acquisition company, DiamondPeak Holdings Corp. At one point, you could buy RIDE stock for more than $27 a share.

The electric vehicle company unveiled a pickup truck prototype and was being talked about as a potential challenger to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

But then federal regulators stepped in and began questioning SPAC deals in general. And specific to Lordstown, regulators wanted to know if the company deliberately overstated its claims about truck orders.

By February, RIDE stock was in free-fall and now trades in penny stock territory.

Lordstown says it still plans to begin production of its Endurance truck this year, and says it plans to deliver 500 units in 2022 and 2,500 units in 2023. But General Motors (NYSE:GM), and early investor in RIDE stock, announced that its sold its 7.5 million shares of Lordstown stock.

Story continues

I suppose it’s possible that Lordstown could find a way out of this mess. But it’s not looking good. Delivering a total of 3,000 trucks by the end of next year will barely move the needle toward the company turning a profit. And the idea of competing with Tesla seems to be just a folly at this point.

Avoid RIDE stock for the immediate future.

""You know, Elon, I guess it's possible Twitter could be worse. But it also could be better… So I have a wait and see attitude,” Gates told the BBC.

Gates added that he admires Musk for his work Tesla and SpaceX.

“So far, the things Elon’s tackled he’s done a spectacularly good job, his work at Tesla helps with climate change, with SpaceX he’s gotten way out in front on that,” he said.

Gates’ ambivalence about a Musk-led Twitter comes a week after Tesla CEO’s struck a deal to takeover the company. CNBC reported Thursday that Musk is expected to serve as temporary Twitter CEO once his $44 billion takeover of the social media platform is complete.

After some resistance to Musk’s takeover, Twitter and Musk reached a deal for the billionaire to buy the platform in late April. On Thursday, Musk said he secured about $7.14 billion in equity commitments for the takeover from 19 co-investors, according to the Wall Street Journal. With the new funding, Musk reduced the $12.5 billion loan he had originally taken out to finance the deal to $6.25 billion, the Journal reports.

Musk’s hostile takeover of Twitter started in early April when he bought a 9.2% stake in the company and was quickly offered a seat on Twitter’s board of directors. Accepting the board seat would have prevented Musk from owning more than 14.9% of the company while on the board. After rejecting the board seat, Musk mounted a bid to buy all Twitter shares at $54.20 a share and take the company private. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk said he plans to take the company public again after a few years.

Gates and Musk have had tense relations in the past and are known to make public jabs at each other.

Story continues

Last week, in a text exchange that Musk confirmed in a tweet as authentic, the richest man in the world asked Gates if he was shorting Tesla stock. Gates reportedly confirmed that he was betting on Tesla’s stock price falling and asked to talk with Musk about philanthropy, a request Musk shot down.

“Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change,” Musk reportedly said in the text exchange.

Gates said in an interview published Wednesday by the BBC that shorting Tesla “has nothing to do with climate change.” He did not specifically tell the BBC whether he was shorting Tesla stock or not.
On April 22, Musk tweeted a picture of Gates side-by-side with an emoji of a pregnant man with the caption “in case u need to lose a boner fast.” A few days later, Musk said in a tweet that he was moving on “from making fun of Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action.”

187,Blink Charging CEO: Investors shouldn’t expect EV plays to be profitable — yet,"Soaring gas prices helped drive electric vehicle adoption in the first quarter, with EVs doubling their market share to 5.2% in the U.S.

But even as an all-electric future draws nearer, don’t expect big profits anytime soon from the companies involved. According to Michael Farkas, founder and CEO of Blink Charging (BLNK), profitability for companies in the EV space is ""unrealistic"" given where the industry is right now.

""People [ask]: 'Is it in its infantile state?' And I go: 'No, it's actually at its embryonic state when you look at the numbers,” Farkas said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “So it's not going to mean profitability tomorrow. If that's your expectation, then this is not the industry for you.” Electric car charging at a Blink charger at a press conference at the Bowmansville service station.

'Rewards will be there in the future'

The global race to net zero has supercharged the EV charging infrastructure market, with some estimates expecting revenue to top $147 billion by 2030. However, investors have become increasingly skeptical about the medium-term growth prospects of companies that are far from profitability.

Blink’s stock has declined more than 35% in the last month, hitting a 52-week low on Thursday. While the sell-off has coincided with a broader pullback in high growth names, the declines have been more pronounced in the EV space. Blink rival Chargepoint (CHPT) and EVgo (EVGO), for instance, are both down more than 30% while electric truck maker Rivian (RIVN) has fallen over 25%.

“This is a growth industry. This is about land grab and growing out your footprint and investing in infrastructure,” Farkas said. “I believe the rewards will be there in the future. It's just a matter of having a long-term perspective. A lot of investors today look for the short term.”

Blink lags far behind competitors, including Tesla (TSLA) in the U.S., in the number of charging units deployed, though the company has been looking to expand rapidly through acquisitions.

Story continues

Last week, it signed a $23.4 million deal to purchase Electric Blue (EB Charging) and its 1,150 chargers in the United Kingdom, marking the company’s first entry into the UK market. That was preceded by an expansion into Greece and Latin America. And last year, the company signed a nearly $24 million acquisition deal to purchase Belgium-based charging operator Blue Corner N.V. and its 7,071 charging ports across Europe.

The land grab comes as countries plow ahead to reach emissions reduction targets and slow climate change.

The Biden administration has pledged to reduce the number of new gas-powered vehicles sold in the U.S. by half by 2030. As part of that effort, the infrastructure bill signed into law last year sets aside $7.5 billion to build out a national charging network with the aim of making 500,000 chargers accessible to Americans.

“Today if you look at estimates, we have roughly a couple million charging stations deployed globally. There are a lot of them that are not viable chargers, prior technology,” Farkas said. “By all estimates, you're looking at needing between 120 to 150 million chargers by 2030. Really this is the beginning of the process in this industry.”

191,Tesla Looking to Boost Shanghai Car Production With Second Shift,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is making plans to resume double shifts at its factory in Shanghai as soon as mid-May as it expects staffing and parts shortages to ease, according to people familiar with the matter.

The U.S. electric carmaker’s China factory was shuttered for three weeks in April as Shanghai was plunged into lockdown in an attempt to halt community spread of Covid-19. The plant started up again in late April under a so-called closed loop system whereby workers live on site and are tested regularly. The workers in that system have been doing 12-hour shifts, six days a week.

Now Tesla is aiming to bring back more employees to keep factory lines running around the clock, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the details are private. Prior to the pandemic-inducted halt on March 28, Tesla workers in Shanghai were working three shifts covering 24 hours, seven days a week.

The Shanghai factory’s management committee is trying to determine how feasible it is to bring more workers back, canvassing the willingness of staff to leave their residential compounds and collating address information to get a better picture of where in the city people are located, the people said.

Executives are also looking at daily door-to-door shuttle buses that would allow some workers to return home after their shift rather than sleep at the factory, they said.

A Tesla representative said there were no further updates as yet regarding the factory’s status.

In the meantime, Tesla’s Shanghai factory, which in regular times pumps out around 2,100 cars a day, remains challenged by component shortages. Tesla only has inventory for just over two weeks based on its current closed-loop schedule, another person familiar with the matter said last month, and logistics are a major problem for many other parts.

The company’s China website shows new customers can expect a wait time of between 20 to 24 weeks for a Model 3, up from around four to six weeks normally.

Shanghai reported 4,024 local asymptomatic Covid cases and 245 confirmed infections Thursday. While cases have been coming down, the city has said it will continue to mass test citizens and only lift the lockdown once community transmission reaches zero.

While officials are encouraging firms to restart production -- China said last month it will give assistance to more than 600 selected companies to help restart factory activities -- the reality on the ground may be more complex.

Some 63% of Japanese companies that own a plant in Shanghai say they’re still fully halting operations, the Nikkei reported Friday, citing the Shanghai Japanese Commerce & Industry Club.

Investing.com -- The bond market continues to flash warning signs about inflation, with the 10-year Treasury yield hitting its highest since late 2018 overnight. The U.S. employment will shed light on whether inflation is weakening the trend in job growth, or whether it’s drawing more people back into the labor market. Elon Musk is a big step closer to completing his acquisition of Twitter and oil prices rise again as the EU tries to remove a stumbling block to its Russian oil embargo. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 6th May.

1. Bonds still flashing warning signs

The bond market continues to flash warning signs after another highly volatile day left markets torn between the twin fears of inflation and recession.

The U.S. 10-year yield, which can be taken as a rough proxy for short-term rates over the next decade, hit a new 3½ year high of 3.10% overnight, reflecting perhaps the realization of how much liquidity conditions will change later in the year when the roll-off of the Fed’s balance sheet accelerates.

The 2-year Treasury yield, however, was less volatile and is set to end the week roughly where it started it. That suggests that market expectations for Fed rates in the next two years haven’t changed much, for all of the volatility witnessed in the last two days.

The overall impression is one of high uncertainty exacerbated by thin liquidity, against a backdrop of rising fear of ‘stagflation’ setting in.

That fear was in evidence on Thursday in response to the Bank of England’s rate hike cum growth downgrade, and the risk of the Eurozone heading the same way is growing by the day. German industrial orders and production both fell sharply in March, while Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau warned that a weak euro risked worsening the inflation picture still further.

2. Payrolls growth set to slow a bit

The U.S. economy is expected to have added another 391,000 jobs in the month through mid-April, a slight slowdown from the previous month’s 431,000.

Story continues

The official labor market report, due at 8:30 AM ET, is also set to show the jobless rate ticking down to 3.5% of the workforce. However, perhaps the most important numbers in the report will be the participation rate and average hourly earnings.

Record high vacancies and a shortage of workers are allowing wages to grow at rates well above what is consistent with low inflation. As such, any further acceleration in wage growth is likely to revive the fears of higher interest rates that have battered markets this week. Any sign of inactive people returning to the workforce will, by contrast, ease such fears. The participation rate has risen by nearly 1 percent in the last five months as pandemic savings were drawn down, especially by lower income groups.

The New York Federal Reserve President John Williams will speak at 9:15 AM ET, which may add some color and analysis to the report.

3. U.S. stocks set to extend losses at open

U.S. stock markets are set to extend their losses at the open, after enduring their worst day since the first wave of the pandemic on Thursday.

By 6 AM ET (1000 GMT), Dow futures were down 40 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.6%.

Stocks likely to be in focus later include electric vehicle group Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID), which posted a narrower loss than expected after the close on Thursday, as well as Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV), which reported solid profits as the concert and sports business rebounded. EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) also joined the ranks of oil and gas companies enjoying the uplift from crude prices.

Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) also has better-than-expected numbers out this morning, while insurance giant Cigna (NYSE:CI) reports before the open.

4. Musk finds backers for Twitter acquisition

Elon Musk’s bid for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) looks closer to becoming reality after the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO announced he had found another $7.1 billion in equity backing from a range of wealthy investors. Some, such as Prince Al Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, are existing shareholders who will keep their stock, while others such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison and bitcoin exchange Binance, will buy for the first time.

Venture capital companies Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz are also due to inject cash, along with Fidelity and Brookfield Asset Management.

The net effect is to reduce the amount that Musk has to borrow against his Tesla stock by half, significantly reducing the risk of forced liquidations. Tesla stock inched down in premarket despite the news, while Twitter stock held Thursday’s gains to trade at $50.09 by 6 AM ET, less than 10% below Musk’s offer price.

Separate reports suggested that Musk has agreed to take over as CEO temporarily if his bid succeeds.

5. Oil firms as EU acts to remove hurdle to embargo

Oil prices stayed well bid as the European Union tried to remove the biggest stumbling block to its proposed embargo on Russian oil and refined products.

Bloomberg reported officials as saying the EU will exempt give Hungary, Slovakia and Czechia up to two more years to comply with the ban, owing to their disproportionately high dependence on Soviet-era pipelines.

The sanctions package can only come into force with unanimous support. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is pressing for a five-year exemption, according to various reports.

By 6 AM ET (1000 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 2.3% at $110.69 a barrel, while Brent crude was up 2.2% at $113.39.

195,Tesla targets pre-lockdown output in Shanghai by mid-May,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Tesla is aiming to increase output at its Shanghai plant to 2,600 cars a day from May 16, it said in an internal memo seen by Reuters, as it seeks to restore production to levels before the city locked down to control COVID-19.

Tesla, which is now only running one shift, plans to add more at its Shanghai plant from May 16 to achieve the goal, the memo reviewed by Reuters showed.

That would bring weekly output to 16,900 vehicles based on Tesla's established work week at the facility, according to Reuters calculations.

It would also represent a return to the production levels at the plant before Shanghai's lockdown in late March forced the company to suspend work there.

Tesla declined to provide immediate comment.

Before the lockdown, Tesla had run three shifts at the Shanghai plant. The factory, which makes Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y, reopened on April 19 after a 22-day closure, its longest since the site opened in late 2019.

The Shanghai lockdown has also been challenging for Tesla and other manufacturers because of the complication of getting parts from suppliers.

In one example, Aptiv, which supplies wire harnesses for Tesla, was not able to resume production in mid-April and there were concerns that this could have a knock-on effect on the automaker's production, according to a person familiar with the matter.

But Tesla managed to secure wire harnesses from other suppliers and Aptiv got approval from authorities to resume production at the end of April, the person said.

Aptiv did not immediately respond to a query for comment.

The disruption to Tesla's Shanghai plant has been one of the highest profile consequences of China's measures to control its biggest COVID-19 outbreak, which have also crimped consumption, including vehicle sales.

Sales of electric vehicles (EV) had been booming in China before the COVID lockdowns. Tesla’s sales in China jumped 56% in the first quarter, while EV sales by its larger rival in China, BYD, increased fivefold.

Story continues

Tesla assembled 55,462 vehicles in March at its Shanghai plant when it paused production for six days in the month, data from China Passenger Car Association showed.

The reopening of its Shanghai factory was heavily publicised by state media and was undertaken with the support of authorities who helped Tesla transport more than 6,000 workers and carry out disinfection work, Reuters reported this week.

Tesla's progress, however, comes as a survey showed that Japanese companies are struggling to reopen factories in Shanghai, indicating difficulties with the municipal government's push to help key businesses get back to work.

The Shanghai Japanese Commerce and Industry Club said on Thursday that of 54 companies that responded to an April 27-30 survey, 63% said their factories had yet to resume operations.

197,Dow Futures Fall 100 Pts; Nonfarm Payrolls Loom Large,"By Peter Nurse

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, adding to the previous session’s dramatic selloff on concerns a solid April nonfarm payrolls release will add to expectations of aggressive monetary policy tightening.

At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 100 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.6%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 115 points, or 0.9%.

The three main Wall Street indices slumped Thursday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling more than 1,000 points, or 3.1%, its worst daily performance since October 2020.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 5%, its biggest one-day percentage decline since June 2020, as yields on Treasury bonds shot above 3%.

This meltdown reversed the relief rally following Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting, and the volatility suggests the market is grappling with how to price in inflation and slowing growth.

“Base case remains equity lows, yield highs yet to be reached,” Bank of America’s strategists wrote in a note. “‘Recession shock’ was priced-in too quickly; this is a problem as stronger-than-expected economic data in the first half is causing the market to price-in longer/bigger inflation/rates shock.”

With this in mind, investors will focus on the April jobs report, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with an additional 391,000 nonfarm payrolls expected, below the previous 431,000 reading.

However, perhaps the most important numbers in the report will be the participation rate and average hourly earnings.

“An average hourly earnings number in line with consensus (0.4% month-on-month, 5.5% year-on-year) should keep U.S. yields and the dollar firm. Any soft headline employment data will be ascribed to tight labour markets,” said analysts at ING, in a note.

In the corporate sector, Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) is likely to be in focus after the electric vehicle group posted a narrower loss than expected after the close on Thursday, while Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) reported solid profits as the concert and sports business rebounded.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in the spotlight after Reuters reported that the electric car maker is aiming to increase output at its Shanghai plant to 2,600 cars a day from May 16, as it seeks to restore production to levels before the city locked down to control COVID-19.

Earnings are also due from the likes of clothes retailer Under Armour (NYSE:UA) and insurance giant Cigna (NYSE:CI) before the bell.

Oil prices traded higher Friday, on course for a second straight weekly gain, on persistent concerns over the tightness of global supply.

The EU is seeking to remove the biggest stumbling block to its proposed embargo on Russian oil and refined products, offering exemptions to some central European member states, hoping that the concessions will ensure the unanimity needed for the sanctions to come into force.

By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.1% higher at $110.55 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2.2% to $113.29.

Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,884.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.0591.

204,"Investors Heavily Search Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): Here is What You Need to Know","Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned -17.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -8.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has lost 18.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Tesla is expected to post earnings of $2.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +59.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +24.7%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.26 points to a change of +66.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +30.6%.

Story continues

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.73 indicates a change of +22% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +116.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TSLA _12MonthEPSChartUrl

Projected Revenue Growth

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

For Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.12 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +59.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $87.26 billion and $113.64 billion estimates indicate +62.1% and +30.2% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Tesla reported revenues of $18.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +80.5%. EPS of $3.22 for the same period compares with $0.93 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.57%. The EPS surprise was +49.77%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Tesla is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

210,Brazil's Vale signs long-term deal to supply Tesla with nickel,"By Gabriel Araujo

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian miner Vale SA said on Friday it has signed a long-term deal with Tesla Inc to supply the U.S.-based electric vehicle maker with nickel from its Canadian operations.

Vale did not provide financial details on the deal and did not say how long it will last.

The Brazilian miner said in a securities filing that the agreement involves supplying Tesla with low-carbon Class 1 nickel and is in line with its strategy of increasing its exposure to the electric vehicle industry.

Vale said it aims for between 30% and 40% of its Class 1 nickel sales to go to the fast-growing sector, without detailing how much it would represent in terms of volume.

According to the company's first quarter performance report, Vale sold a total of 20,000 tonnes of Upper Class 1 nickel in the period, of which 1,300 tonnes were to the electric vehicle industry.

Canada's Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey said on Twitter the deal would include nickel produced by Vale at its Long Harbour plant, which is located in the province.

""Congratulations to Vale on signing this significant deal with Tesla to supply the nickel the company needs to make batteries for electric vehicles,"" Furey said.

""Nickel from right here in Newfoundland and Labrador. Our province is certainly rich in resources the world needs today.""

According to Vale, nickel rounds produced at its Long Harbour facility have a carbon footprint of 4.4 tonnes of CO2 equivalent for each ton of nickel, which it had previously claimed to be about one-third the Nickel Institute average for Class 1 nickel.

Vale said on its website that such a carbon footprint makes it a ""supplier-of-choice for the electric vehicle industry"".

The electric-vehicle maker’s report issued Friday is the most comprehensive view Tesla has given of its metals-supplier relationships, a topic of increased interest as global auto industry demand for EV batteries has exceeded supplies. Unlike most other major carmakers, Tesla has sought to manufacture its own battery cells and buy raw materials directly from metals producers.

Tesla listed Vale as a direct supplier of nickel for batteries, sourcing the metal from an integrated mine and refining site in Canada, which Bloomberg News first reported in March. The report also detailed agreements with producers such as Albemarle Corp., Livent Corp. and China’s Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group Co. for supplies of lithium.

As the EV market leader’s battery supply chain continues to scale, Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to grow. It already has deals with nine mining and chemicals companies to supply more than 95% of its lithium, greater than half its cobalt and over a third of its nickel, according to the report.

The 144-page annual filing covers the Austin, Texas-based company’s environmental impact, supply chain, recycling and diversity and inclusion efforts.

Tesla confirmed its health insurance policies included travel and lodging for employees who had to seek health-care services out of state. That has become increasingly relevant because Texas has made it more difficult to get abortions and the state is prepared to outlaw the procedure entirely if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its stance preventing such a move.

Story continues

The New York Times earlier reported on the health-care provision.

Tesla also provided previously undisclosed statistics on the racial breakdown of workers in the U.S. based on the private filings it submits each year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. However, unlike competitors including General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., it only detailed percentages and not raw numbers for employees in each category, a practice that diversity experts say can obscure weaknesses depending on how jobs are categorized.

Read why Tesla is holding out against releasing full diversity data

Tesla selected a handful of companies to argue its racial representation compares favorably to the tech and automotive industries. Its Hispanic workforce at the end of 2021 was much higher than Ford’s and GM’s -- the only two automakers it compared itself against -- though the advantage was much smaller for professional and executive roles. On the flip side, Tesla was underrepresented for Black workers compared with the two competitors based in Detroit.

The EEOC provides more comprehensive industry data each year that might put Tesla’s numbers in more perspective, but hasn’t yet provided the figures for 2021.

Tesla said its worldwide headcount grew 40% in 2021. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk recently tweeted it has over 110,000 “direct jobs” globally.

Story continues

8. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO)

Shares of the Chinese electric vehicle company Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) are down by a whopping 60% in the last 12 months. Still, Cathie Wood bought a new stake in the company. ARK added 420,057 shares of Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) to its portfolio in the first quarter, valued at $8.84 million.

7. Global-E Online Ltd (NASDAQ:GLBE)

Global-E Online Ltd (NASDAQ:GLBE) is an Israel-based company that provides cross-border sales solutions. The company claims to use big-data and business intelligence to boost international traffic conversion for businesses. Global-E Online Ltd (NASDAQ:GLBE)’s stock is down a whopping 60 % in the last 6 months. Cathie Wood’s hedge fund added 563,078 shares of Global-E Online Ltd (NASDAQ:GLBE) to its portfolio in the first quarter of 2022. The total value of these shares was$19.02 million.

Artisan Partners, a high value-added investment management firm, mentioned Global-E Online Ltd in its fourth quarter investor letter. The fund said:

“We added to several positions during the quarter including Global-E Online Ltd (NASDAQ:GLBE). Global-e online is a global e-commerce service platform enabling cross-border transactions across 200+ countries. It provides three critical elements: website localization, payments and logistics. For background, ~30% of a global brand’s online traffic is from international shoppers, though the portion of its international sales is no more than 5%-10% as brands struggle to overcome numerous cross-border challenges—different languages, currencies, payment methods, duties/taxes and shipping providers. There is no one-size-fits-all solution as each market is unique; hence, merchants of all sizes find a do-it-yourself cross-border strategy to be complex, costly and difficult to maintain. In our view, the capability of Global-e online’s platform to remove these frictions was recently validated by its strategic partnership with e-commerce platform giant Shopify, which also made an equity investment in the company. With strong current performance and the potential for accelerated growth once Global-e completes its technological integration with Shopify’s platform, we added to our GardenSM position.”

6. Fathom Digital Manufacturing Corp (NYSE:FATH)

Fathom Digital Manufacturing Corp (NYSE:FATH) is a 3D printing company.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 17 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Fathom Digital Manufacturing Corp (NYSE:FATH).

217,"Musk, Twitter are sued by shareholder over $44 bln takeover","May 6 (Reuters) - Elon Musk and Twitter Inc were sued on Friday by a Florida pension fund seeking to stop Musk from quickly completing his planned $44 billion takeover of the social media company.

In a complaint filed in Delaware Chancery Court, the Orlando Police Pension Fund said that under Delaware law Musk cannot complete the takeover until at least 2025 unless holders of two-thirds of shares not ""owned"" by him approved.

The lawsuit said Musk became an ""interested stockholder"" after taking a more than 9% Twitter stake, requiring the delay.

Musk also runs electric car company Tesla Inc and is the world's richest person according to Forbes magazine.

Twitter and its board, including Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, are also defendants.

The lawsuit seeks to delay the merger's closing until at least 2025, declare that Twitter directors breached their fiduciary duties, and recoup legal fees and costs.

Twitter declined to comment. A lawyer for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Funds managed by Wood’s Ark Investment Management had already been selling the social-media platform this year even before the Tesla Inc. co-founder struck a deal to take Twitter private. On Thursday, when Twitter was one of the few stocks that gained amid a vicious rout, the funds sold a further 875,000 shares, nearly eliminating all of their remaining Twitter holdings.

The Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ticker ARKW), which had about 5% in Twitter at the end of last year, cut its stake to about 2% by this week and then almost entirely disposed of it on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), which has maintained Twitter at about 1% this year, also trimmed its stake Thursday to 0.7%. The flagship Innovation ETF (ARKK) had already eliminated its Twitter holdings by mid-February.

Wood had expressed concerns about the platform that were similar to Musk’s, saying her firm’s confidence in Twitter “was nicked a bit as we saw some of the censorship issues and controversies.” After his deal was announced, she thanked Musk in a tweet.

Ark’s exchange-traded funds have been under pressure from rising interest rates, which have weighed particularly hard on the valuations of growth stocks. Since the ETFs had been cutting their Twitter holdings this year, they also missed out on some of the gains in Twitter after Musk disclosed that he’d become Twitter’s biggest shareholder in April.

Meanwhile, Wood has stuck with Tesla, which is the biggest holding in ARKK and the second-biggest holding in ARKW. It’s also kept former lockdown-era favorites, like Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Teladoc Health Inc., which have tumbled 46% and 63%, respectively, this year.

Story continues

ARKK experienced its worst month ever in April and its shares are down 51% in 2022, while ARKW has dropped 48% and ARKF has fallen 51%.

220,"Tesla, Echoing Musk, Says ESG Metrics Are ‘Fundamentally Flawed’","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has criticized ESG for making little sense, said current ways of measuring environmental, social and governance issues are “fundamentally flawed.”

In a 144-page annual report, the electric vehicle-maker said ESG ratings are based on how corporate profits are affected by ESG-related factors, rather than gauging a company’s real-world impact on society and the environment. The ratings are used by money managers to help decide where to invest.

In effect, individual investors who park their money in ESG funds managed by large asset managers are unaware that their capital is being used to buy shares of companies that are exacerbating the effects of climate change, rather than mitigating it, Tesla said.

“We need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes actual positive impact on our planet, so unsuspecting individual investors can choose to support companies that can make and prioritize positive change,” the Austin, Texas-based company said. It added that large investors, ratings agencies, companies and the public need to push for change.

Musk has been a recent critic of ESG, and has said its investment principles should be “deleted if not fixed.”

In its report, Tesla cited how automakers may see their ESG ratings increase even though they are only slightly reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, while continuing to produce vehicles that burn fossil fuels. Most emissions from vehicles are produced when customers drive them and that data tends to be misreported, not reported at all or based on “unrealistic assumptions,” Tesla said.

221,Elon’s war of words with the Saudi prince is over as he secures further funding to buy Twitter. It’s not his first takeover saga involving the kingdom,"Just three weeks ago, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud was one of many Twitter shareholders to publicly voice displeasure with the news that the world’s richest man was putting together a bid to purchase the social media platform.

“I don’t believe that the proposed offer by Elon Musk ($54.20) comes close to the intrinsic value of Twitter given its growth prospects. Being one of the largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter…I reject this offer,” the Saudi billionaire tweeted.

Now Musk and Alwaleed—who personally owns a 4.45% stake in Twitter and another 0.72% of the company through his company Kingdom Holding—have reconciled their differences.

It’s unclear how Musk was able to change Alwaleed’s mind, but in a tweet Thursday, the Saudi prince called the Tesla CEO his “new friend” and pledged to roll the $1.9 billion stake he owns in Twitter toward Musk’s privatization effort.

Things weren’t always so smooth. After Alwaleed tweeted out his rejection of Musk’s offer in April, Musk responded by questioning Saudi Arabia’s views on freedom of the press.

The country—which explicitly does not provide for freedom of expression or press, according to a 2018 U.S. State Department report on human rights in Saudi Arabia—currently ranks 166 out of 180 on the 2022 Press Freedom Index.

This is not the first fallout over a takeover deal—or even the funding for one—between Musk and the Saudi Kingdom.

Musk's previous attempt to secure Saudi funding

In 2018, Musk led a confusing effort to take Tesla private, at first tweeting out a seeming joke that he wanted to buy it for $420 per share, with “funding secured,” shortly before appearing on Joe Rogan’s podcast and apparently smoking weed on air. When the funding turned out not to be secured, reports emerged that the Saudi Kingdom was in talks to provide Musk with backing. That fell through, and Musk’s initial tweet of a takeover bid for Tesla resulted in lawsuits from the SEC and a still-ongoing matter filed by shareholders.

Story continues

In a series of text messages that recently came to light as part of the shareholder suit, Musk criticized Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the head of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, for not publicly backing the take-private.

Musk alleged that Al-Rumayyan had “strongly conveyed” that the Saudi PIF would finance Musk’s bid to privatize the electric car company during an in-person meeting, but a statement Al-Rumayyan provided to Bloomberg News at the time suggested the commitment was far less set in stone.

“This is an extremely weak statement and does not reflect the conversation we had at Tesla. You said you were definitely interested in taking Tesla private and had wanted to do so since 2016,” Musk texted Al-Rumayyan. “I’m sorry, but we cannot work together.”

Flash forward to 2022, and now Musk actually has a Saudi backer for a massive take-private deal. Alwaleed joins a growing list of 19 private investors and firms that have agreed to make an equity investment in Twitter in the aftermath of Musk’s purchase.

That list also includes Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, Binance, Sequoia Capital, Brookfield, and the Qatar Investment Authority, who collectively agreed to supply Musk with $7.1 billion in funding on Thursday.

""We hope to be able to play a role in bringing social media and Web3 together and broadening the use and adoption of crypto and blockchain technology,"" crypto exchange Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a statement.

Other major investors include Strauss Capital, Andersson Horowitz, and Fidelity.

Another week has passed with the European Union unable to agree on a comprehensive oil embargo on Russian crude, hindered by internal disagreements on the timeline of the phasing out. Should the draft see adoption, we might be in for another supply squeeze as OPEC+ has clearly indicated it values consistency over abrupt moves. Should the United States push forward with its NOPEC bill, the willingness of the oil group to satiate global demand might fall even further.

OPEC+ Rubberstamps Another 432,000 b/d Deal. In a meeting that lasted only 13 minutes, OPEC+ countries have agreed to increase their June 2022 production target by 432,000 b/d, avoiding any talk about sanctions on Russia and indicating global supply/demand picture is more or less balanced.

Russia Oil Ban Hinges on CEE Pushback. Despite Germany coming to embrace a Russian oil embargo, the European Union has still been unable to agree on a phase-out of Russian crude imports as most dependent countries like Hungary or Slovakia keep on asking for exemptions.

US Senate Committee Passes NOPEC Bill. A US Senate committee passed the NOPEC bill that was presented with bipartisan support, potentially revoking the sovereign immunity protecting OPEC countries and Middle Eastern NOCs from lawsuits, as high gasoline prices and inflation compel US lawmakers to take more aggressive action.

Venezuela’s Crude Exports Drop Amid Quality Issues. According to media reports, crude exports of Venezuela’s national oil company PDVSA fell 8% month-on-month in April to some 650,000 b/d as poor crude quality and limited upgrading capacity were limiting further upticks.

China Doubles Down on Its LNG Tanker Fleet. China’s state-controlled CNOOC (SHA:600938) has reportedly awarded 2.5 billion worth of contracts to build 12 liquefied natural gas tankers at the Hudong Zhonghua shipyards, seeking to grab a higher share of the LNG freight market in Asia.

Nordic Power Prices Rise to All-Time High. Front-year electricity prices in Europe’s Scandinavia have raised to an all-time high this week of €92 per MWh, driven by low hydro storage available in the south of Norway with the country’s total water reservoirs being only 22% full.

Wind Turbine Makers Looking Forward to Forgetting Q1. Wind turbine makers like Vestas (CPH:VWS), GE Renewable Energy (NYSE:GE), andSiemens Gamesa (BME:SGRE) all reported losses for the first three months of 2022, coming on the back of soaring raw material costs and increasing competition.

232,UPDATE 3-Musk aims to quintuple Twitter's revenue to $26.4 bln by 2028 -NYT,"(Adds details from the NYT report, background on financing)

May 6 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is aiming to increase Twitter's annual revenue to $26.4 billion by 2028, up from $5 billion last year, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing a pitch deck presented by the world's richest man to investors.

Advertising will fall to 45% of total revenue under Musk, down from about 90% in 2020, generating $12 billion in revenue in 2028, while subscriptions are expected to pull in another $10 billion, according to the report.

The head of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc also aims to increase Twitter's cash flow to $3.2 billion in 2025 and $9.4 billion in 2028, the newspaper reported, citing the presentation.

Musk clinched a deal last month to buy Twitter for $44 billion in cash, in a move that will shift control of the social media platform populated by millions of users and global leaders to the Tesla Inc chief.

The billionaire has promised to revitalize the company and expand the number of users by cracking down on spam bots and reducing the amount of moderation to facilitate more ""free speech"".

After the closure of the deal, Musk is expected to become Twitter's temporary CEO, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

Among his other goals, Musk expects the social media company to bring in $15 million from a payments business in 2023 that will grow to about $1.3 billion by 2028, the NYT cited the document as saying.

Musk anticipates he can increase Twitter's average revenue per user to $30.22 in 2028 from $24.83 last year, it added. He also expects Twitter to have 11,072 employees by 2025, up from around 7,500.

Revenue from Twitter Blue, the company's premium subscription service launched last year, is expected to have 69 million users by 2025, the NYT reported https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/06/technology/elon-musk-twitter-pitch-deck.html.

Musk, in a now deleted tweet last month, suggested a raft of changes to the social media giant's Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price.

On Thursday, Musk listed a group of high-profile investors who are ready to provide funding of $7.14 billion for his Twitter bid, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Sequoia Capital.

Musk has increased the financing commitment to $27.25 billion, which includes commitments from 19 investors, and reduced a margin loan from Morgan Stanley tied to his Tesla stock to $6.25 billion. He has already secured commitments for $13 billion in loans against Twitter shares.

Musk could not be reached for comment. Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

237,Exclusive: Arbitrage Expert Julian Klymochko Breaks Down Twitter Acquisition And Elon Musk's Options,"News of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk acquiring social media platform Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) has been one of the biggest topics of the investing world in 2022.

Musk offered to buy Twitter shares for $54.20 each, yet shares have been trading around the $49 level. Benzinga spoke recently with Julian Klymochko, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Accelerate, a company offering ETFs and alternative investments.

Klymochko has a history of analyzing mergers and often invests in the arbitrage opportunity of deals, or the amount that can be made if the deal closes. Klymochko recently estimated that he has invested in/analyzed over 2,500 mergers over the last 15 years.

Twitter Premium: Musk offered to buy Twitter shares for $54.20 and shares are trading below the price. Here’s what Klymochko had to say of the difference.

“Musk’s $44 billion leveraged buyout of Twitter is the largest LBO of all time (by a longshot). The financing package includes an exceptional amount of leverage, including $25.5 billion debt and margin loan commitments,” Klymochko told Benzinga.

Klymochko said the market is pricing in around 70% odds of success of the deal closing. Klymochko points to the risks of the deal being credit markets falling or the price of Tesla shares dropping, with the margin loan reliant on the share value of Tesla.

“Musk agreed to put up a $21 billion equity check. This is an astronomical amount of cash, even for the world’s wealthiest person. He has been divesting TSLA stock in addition to seeking partners to help fund this commitment.”

Musk recently announced a filing with new investors in the buyout that included Larry Ellison, Binance, a16z and others.

Can Elon Musk Walk From Deal?: One popular topic put forth on social media is if Musk can decide to walk away from the planned acquisition.

“Musk signed a definitive agreement, which is a legally binding agreement, to acquire Twitter for $54.20 per share. He cannot walk away from the deal,” Klymochko said.

Story continues

If Musk backs out from the deal, Klymochko said Twitter could sue and push for a court decision to force him to close the deal. If Musk is unable to obtain the proper financing, he would have to pay a $1 billion reverse break fee. A judge could award monetary damages in excess of the $1 billion break fee, depending on several scenarios, Klymochko added.

“Other things that could cause the merger agreement to terminate include shareholders voting against it (unlikely) and regulators blocking it (also unlikely).”

Twitter Deal Summary: The previous record for a leveraged buyout was KKR & Co (NYSE: KKR) and TPG Inc (NASDAQ: TPG) acquiring energy company TXU for $12 billion. TXU went bankrupt after the leveraged buyout.

The deal terms of the Twitter acquisition provide some risk with the financing methods and tie-in of Tesla shares.

Klymochko estimated that if the deal to acquire Twitter falls through, shares of the social media platform could fall to the mid-$30s.

What Happened: With the deal still pending and shares trading well below the $95 level, Benzinga spoke to merger and arbitrage expert Julian Klymochko.

Klymochko is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Accelerate Funds, a company that offers ETFs, and alternative funds with arbitrage are among the market opportunities it offers investors.

Klymochko has a history of analyzing mergers and often invests in the arbitrage opportunity of deals, or the amount that can be made if the deal closes. Klymochko recently estimated that he has invested in/analyzed over 2,500 mergers over the last 15 years.

Activision Acquisition: Similar to the acquisition of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, shares of the target company Activision are trading well below their buyout price, which offers a potential investment opportunity.

It was recently announced by Warren Buffett that Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B) owns a 9.5% stake in Activision Blizzard, seeing an opportunity to capture the deal spread with shares trading well below the acquisition price.

“It appears to be a wise investment by Buffett because his team liked the stock before the deal. It could be a case of ‘heads we win, tails we win’ because the successful arbitrage could bring a 22% annualized return, while they would still like the stock as a hold in the case in which the deal breaks,” Klymochko said.

There is some degree of risk with the Microsoft acquisition, as antitrust regulators could block the deal. Klymochko thinks this shouldn’t be a huge risk.

“The main risk in Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision is an overzealous antitrust regulator looking to make a case against ‘big tech’ and taking the parties to court to block the deal, despite them not having much horizontal overlap. The video game business is highly competitive. When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue behind Tencent and Sony, which would not be an insurmountable issue under a normal antitrust regime.”

244,Sibanye Bides Time on Battery Metals Push as Asset Prices Soar,"(Bloomberg) -- Sibanye Stillwater Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Neal Froneman plans to resume battery-metals acquisitions within two to three years, once inflated asset valuations come down.

The veteran dealmaker wants to make the metals that are key to powering the electric-vehicle revolution a third pillar of Sibanye’s operations, alongside gold and platinum-group metals. While the miner bought lithium and nickel assets in the U.S. and Europe last year, both metals have surged over the past 12 months, making deals less appealing.

“You’re probably aware that right now there’s very frothy nickel and lithium prices that affect valuation,” Froneman said in an interview from Johannesburg. “When prices resume more realistic levels, you can probably expect some activity.”

A gauge of lithium prices more than doubled in the first four months of this year after surging 280% last year. The rally in lithium prompted Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk to appeal for more mining investment to close the widening gap between supply and demand.

Sibanye will focus on opportunities in North America and Europe, positioning the South African miner for markets that will drive demand for EVs, the CEO said. Finland’s Keliber Oy lithium project, in which Sibanye has a 30% stake, could start producing battery grade metal as early as 2024. Increasing its presence in those regions will also help persuade investors to rerate the company, which is being held back by issues in its home country, Froneman said.

South African mining companies not only face the challenges of the world’s deepest platinum and gold deposits, but are grappling with electricity shortages, community unrest and crime.

Story continues

“We are suffering the consequences of bad policies, inequality, poverty,” said Froneman. “All these things are now really creating a lot of difficulty for companies like ourselves to operate.”

Still, the company won’t seek to acquire assets at any cost and will be “patient” in its pursuit of new deals, Froneman said.

“We will look at smaller transactions and we’ll look at large transactions,” Froneman said. “We can buy operating assets and we can also buy assets that need to be turned around.”

China’s exports and imports struggled in April as worsening Covid outbreaks cut demand, undermined production and disrupted logistics in the world’s second-largest economy.

Export growth in April in dollar terms slowed to 3.9% from a year earlier, compared to an increase in March of 14.7%, customs data showed Monday. That’s the weakest pace since June 2020 but faster than the median estimate of a 2.7% gain in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

Imports were unchanged in April after sliding 0.1% in the previous month. Economists expected a 3% decline.

April’s data captures the impact of Covid restrictions on the trade and manufacturing hub Shanghai -- home to the world’s largest port -- where most of the population have been under some form of lockdown for more than five weeks. The disruptions add another threat to global supply chains and inflation, and have affected the operations of companies from Tesla Inc. to Apple Inc.

Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management said export growth may continue to be weak in May because of disruptions to supply chains.

“One big macro issue is to what extent export orders will be shifted to other emerging countries such as India and Vietnam,” he said.

What Bloomberg Economics Says

China’s April trade data offered a glimpse of how lockdowns in Shanghai and other parts of the country are affecting the world’s goods markets. It doesn’t look pretty. An abrupt slowdown in export growth underlines strain on global supply chains from the disruptions to factory output and logistics. Zero import growth -- down from double digits just two months earlier -- suggests domestic demand is cratering.

Story continues

Eric Zhu, China economist

For the full report, click here.

China’s government is trying to get production back on track, but with many foreign businesses saying they’re still unable to resume operations and lockdowns tightening again, it’s unclear how much of the city is actually back to work.

The slowdown in trade is a concern as exports have been one of the strongest growth drivers for China, helping propel the economy out of its Covid-related slump in 2020 to a better-than-expected performance in 2021.

Inflation Effects

Imports were boosted by the soaring prices of energy and commodities. The value of coal imports rose almost 80% in the first four months of the year, while the volume of inbound shipments dropped 16%. The value of crude oil, natural gas, and steel also rose, while volumes fell.

Imports from Russia jumped almost 57%, likely boosted by rising prices of oil, gas and other commodities, which make up the majority of what China buys from Russia. The biggest declines in exports in April were to Russia, with shipments falling about 26% from a year ago, followed by Hong Kong, U.K., Japan and Germany. Exports to the U.S. rose 9.4%.

The slump in China’s trade came despite signs showing global demand likely stayed resilient last month. While South Korea’s exports -- a leading indicator of world trade -- grew by double digits in April, its shipments to China fell 3.4%.

Other data from April also showed the extent to which Covid-related disruptions have bruised the economy. Manufacturing activity plunged to its worst level since February 2020, while logistics bottlenecks have continued to be a strain. Suppliers face the longest delays in more than two years in delivering raw materials to their manufacturing customers and Chinese port activity fell below levels seen during the first coronavirus outbreak in 2020.

The Communist Party’s top leaders have pledged more stimulus to meet an economic growth target of about 5.5% this year, but have also insisted on sticking with the strict Covid Zero strategy -- two goals economists say contradict one another.

By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 421 points, or 1.3% at 32,478 points, the S&P 500 was down 1.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.7%.

The mood was soured by the sight of early backers of electric-van maker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) - an example of the 'profitless tech' sector that has come under the most pressure from the rising interest rate environment - reducing their holdings at a steep discount. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) reportedly sold some 8 million shares while another unnamed seller, thought by most to be Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), planned to sell another 12 million shares, both at a discount of around 6% to Friday's closing level, according to CNBC. Ford itself fell 1.9%.

Rivian stock fell 13% to a new all-time low in the first minutes of trading and has now lost over two-thirds of its value since listing only half a year ago. Other electric vehicle stocks also suffered in sympathy, with Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) stock falling 5.1% and Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) stock falling 10.2%, despite publishing first quarter earnings in line with consensus. Even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the only EV stock that is already consistently profitable, fell 3.8%.

Another stock to fall to an all-time low was cybersecurity and analytics company Palantir (NYSE:PLTR). Palantir missed estimates for first quarter earnings and revenue and also guided lower for the second quarter. It said its operating margin will fall to 20% in the current quarter from 31% a year earlier due to heavy investment in expanding its sales force. Palantir stock fell 22%.

Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock, meanwhile, fell to its lowest in over two years on reports that CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had warned staff of a ""seismic"" shift at the company to put more focus on generating free cash flow. An email reportedly sent to staff by Khosrowshahi hinted of heavy cost cuts and a further scaling back of investments that have only a long-term payoff. The stock pared its early losses to trade down 1.5%.

Tech, in particular, remains vulnerable to sharp selloffs due to fears about rising interest rates, which were not much eased by an April employment report that saw the unemployment rate falling further and the recent improvement in labor force participation reversing. That suggested that the labor market is likely to continue being a source of inflationary pressure for the foreseeable future, keeping the Federal Reserve inclined to raise interest rates in aggressive half-point increments over the next few months.

The few stocks to defy the drop included those that were able to prove they can absorb any rising input costs and pass them on to consumers. Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) stock rose 0.1% after the country's biggest meatpacker reported a 16% rise in revenue in the last quarter.

Today's newsletter is by Brian Sozzi, an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

Sometimes in life things are blatantly obvious.

You blow a tire after doing 90mph on a highway, and a pitstop to the local tire store is in the cards. Drink 10 cups of coffee before noon, and you'll probably need to use the bathroom at least twice before 1:00 p.m.

Fall down the stairs, and you'll likely get scuffed up somewhere.

This fact is why it’s becoming obvious — at least to grizzled finance veterans — that the economy is likely headed into a recession before 2023 ends. There are a few factors underlying this view.

First, inflation is getting worse and in turn, zapping consumer purchasing power. And by getting worse, I mean growth rates are accelerating and touching fresh highs for companies. Moreover, the executives getting paid big bucks to project when inflation may top out, have no visibility into when it may happen.

Couple new examples from my chats with executives:

“We are hedged a lot, more than normal, but it’s not clear we have hit the peak just yet,"" Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""But it’s not clear we have hit the peak just yet. We think it’s going to be high inflationary pressures throughout our fiscal year. I think you see it in things like transportation, particularly things like trucking. You are seeing it in some commodity goods input costs. We see it in glass as an example. But certainly inflation is going to be a challenge throughout the year.”

Hostess Brands CEO Andy Callahan told Yahoo Finance: ""I am not in a position to call the peak. I thought we may be able to have said that last year. When we started the year, we thought inflation would be up double digits. We have now revised that forecast to be more in the high teens. We are seeing it across a broad basket. We have seen it in our commodities like wheat and other things we cover. We are seeing it in our fuel costs and transportation. We are seeing it in packaging. So it's difficult for me to see the peak now.""

Story continues

And here's Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane: “We're seeing right now an acceleration in inflation. When we look even to 2023 we don’t really see bright skies yet. So it’s going to be a challenge going forward for the world.” A customer walks down the coffee and breakfast cereal aisle on the opening day of the new Walmart Neighborhood Market in Panorama City, California, on September 28, 2012. (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/GettyImages)

Inflation appears to be spreading from the goods sector to services sector – which naturally further zaps consumer purchasing power.

“Unfortunately, inflationary pressures are no longer contained to the supply chain or to the goods sector,"" Jefferies Chief Economist Aneta Markowska stated recently. ""They are now present in the service sector as well, and much of the pressure is now emanating from the labor market.""

Aneta is spot on: Just look at the cost to go do things. To see an IMAX movie inside an AMC theater, one adult ticket is $20. The price to bowl one game at a Bowlero on Saturday after 8pm (the cool kids time) is $8. I would say that $8 would buy you two boxes of cereal — but probably not as seen in Kellogg’s CEO comments above.

This elevated, sticky inflation along with Fed rate hikes making it costlier to own a home or put goods and services on credit cards, and you come away with very valid concerns a recession lurks. Not helping matters is a more volatile stock market (caused also by the Fed) now hurting consumer net wealth and likely, spending intentions.

The Federal Reserve shoulders a large part of the responsibility for letting inflation get out of hand. So, this will be their recession to deal with when the time comes. To us common folk, the message is clear: buckle up.

And as always, Happy Trading!

Odds & Ends

Ford drives away from Rivian: Ford will reportedly dump 8 million shares of electric truck maker Rivian now that the lockup period has expired. Rivian has been on a charm offensive with media in recent weeks (including interviews with Rivian founder RJ Scaringe)… execs of course knew Ford was going to go this route.

And Ford should go this route. For one, Rivian has been a colossal disappointment out of the gate as a public company (hence that aforementioned media charm offensive). Why should Ford have its financial statements hurt anymore (it took a hit in the first quarter because of Rivian's tanking stock price) by that poor Rivian execution?

And secondly, Ford continues to speed toward its own electric future with a host of new EVs and manufacturing plants. It’s best Ford detach itself from Rivian, and get full recognition by the market for its impressive feats under CEO Jim Farley of the past year.

Elon’s master Twitter plan: The New York Times got hold of Elon’s pitch deck for Twitter, and it’s a fun read. Elon has a vision to quintuple Twitter’s sales to $26.4 billion by 2028 on a user base of 931 million (compared to 217 million to end last year). LinkedIn founder and Musk friend Reid Hoffman recently told me that he has spoken to Musk about his Twitter vision and is confident on real change being brought to the platform.

Who am I to argue with these two visionaries? Just let me know when I have to start paying for Twitter, Elon.

Starsux: The awful year continues for coffee giant Starbucks. The National Labor Relations Board’s director in Buffalo issued a complaint against 29 unfair labor practices and outlined 200 violations of the National Labor Relations Act. It may be time for Starbucks to bring in crisis PR because it’s really losing the headline battle on the labor union front. Part of this reflects billionaire Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz continuing to throw gas on the fire, and the other is the realities of working in the ever-taxing job that is a Starbucks store employee.

I liked U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh’s message to Howard Schultz on Yahoo Finance Live. Give it a watch.

Trending tickers: The selling pressure persists in cryptocurrencies bitcoin, ethereum, shiba inu, XRP, Cardano, solara and dogecoin, as seen on the Yahoo Finance Trending Tickers page. As long as the sell-off in tech names continues on rate and earnings growth concerns, it’s hard to imagine cryptos stabilize and turn the corner.

And while the appetite to own streaming names isn’t exactly strong right now thanks to weak quarters from Netflix and Roku, Paramount’s decline is surprising given its first quarter was on the relatively strong side. Paramount CFO Naveen Chopra recently struck an upbeat on Yahoo Finance Live. Toss the name on your watch-list.

Constellation Brands is making a rare appearance on the trending ticker page. The stock is up 1% in the past five sessions versus the S&P 500’s 1.2% drop as traders seek out safe-havens. It doesn’t get anymore safe then a Constellation Brands, which sells Kim Crawford wine as well as Modelo, and Corona beer. Here’s what Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands just told me about current trends in the business.

Another stock I continue to watch closely is Qualcomm. Shares are up 1% in the past month compared to 13% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. In this poor tech tape, that is impressive relative out-performance and comes amid a strong first quarter for Qualcomm. Yahoo Finance’s Allie Garfinkle just spoke with Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, so give this a watch too.

BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton will meet Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk in Texas on Monday to discuss global supply chain issues and the bloc's newly agreed rules requiring tech giants to do more to police online content, Breton's spokesman said.

The meeting comes weeks after the world's richest man clinched a deal to buy social media company Twitter Inc for $44 billion in cash.

The meeting comes weeks after the world's richest man clinched a deal to buy the social media company for $44 billion in cash.

In a video with the two men posted on Twitter by Breton, the EU official tells Musk that he explained the Digital Services Act to Musk. ""It fits pretty well with what you think we should do,"" Breton tells Musk in a tweet that included the hashtag #DSA.

""I think it's exactly aligned with my thinking,"" Musk responds.

The two did not go into detail on the new law, which levies hefty fines on companies if they do not control illegal content. The rules ban advertising aimed at children or based on religion, gender, race and political opinions, for example.

252,Volkswagen CEO sees tight race with Tesla for e-car crown by 2025,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Volkswagen faces a tough road ahead to reach its self-imposed target of becoming the world's largest seller of electric vehicles by 2025, its chief executive said on Monday, admitting rival Tesla was stronger than expected.

""It will be a tight race but we won't give up on it,"" Herbert Diess said at the FT Future of the Car 2022 conference. ""I have to say we didn't expect our main U.S. competitor to be so fast and well-prepared,"" he added.

Diess was heavily criticised last year for regularly benchmarking Volkswagen against Tesla and singling out the company's agility and speed to put pressure on the German carmaker's established structures.

Tesla this year opened its first European gigafactory near Berlin, challenging Volkswagen as well as peers BMW and Mercedes-Benz on their home turf, while Diess said he expected Tesla's ramp-up to be challenging.

Diess said he still saw a chance that Volkswagen could manage to overtake Tesla and become the world's No.1 by 2025, pointing to its bigger product offering covering luxury and premium cars as well as volume brands.

Turning to the U.S. market, where Volkswagen aims to more than double its market share to 10%, Diess said this would require an additional plant as well as local battery production, but dismissed the move was due to being over-exposed to China.

253,Indonesian president plans to meet Elon Musk over nickel -minister,"JAKARTA, May 9 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo is planning to meet Elon Musk during an upcoming U.S. visit, a minister said on Monday, as the Southeast Asian country seeks to accelerate development of its nickel industry to supply batteries for electric vehicles.

Representatives of Musk's EV maker Tesla Inc were currently in Indonesia and due to visit the nickel production hub of Morawali on Sulawesi island, Coordinating Minister of Investment and Maritime Affairs Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said.

""They will visit Morowali... They are very satisfied with the data they have received so far,"" Luhut told a streamed media briefing.

In an Instagram post after meeting Musk in Texas in April, Luhut had said he hoped for ""discussions regarding the progress of Indonesia’s nickel industry development, which is high-tech, which can bring our country into the global supply chain of the electric vehicle industry.""

The Indonesian president, widely known as Jokowi, is due to travel to the United States this week for a summit of Southeast Asian leaders in Washington.

Asked about a meeting between Jokowi and Musk, Luhut said ""we're arranging where the meeting will be.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Indonesia is keen to develop a full domestic supply chain for nickel, especially for extracting battery chemicals, making batteries and eventually building EVs.

Southeast Asia's biggest economy has struck multi-billion dollar deals with South Korean and Chinese companies to take advantage of its nickel resources and has been trying to woo Tesla for some time.

Volkswagen (VOW3.DE) said the supply chain disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine are now under control as its CEO said the race to become the world's largest seller of electric vehicles (EV) by 2025 will be tight.

VW has sold out of all new electric models until some time in 2023, mostly due to higher than expected demand.

""The supply situation in Ukraine is under control now, we've set up alternative sources for the wiring harnesses. I would say 90% of our volumes are safe,"" Volkswagen Group boss Herbert Diess said at the FT Future of the Car 2022 conference.

Diess expressed concern about the impact of a lengthy war in Ukraine and said that he would welcome a negotiated outcome to the conflict.

The CEO revealed his ambitions for 7% to 8% of the Volkswagen Group’s sales to be electric this year, rising to 25% by 2025 and 50%-60% by 2030.

“Our goal is to be the world leader in EV sales by 2025. We have a very ambitious plan to achieve that and have invested hugely to achieve it, but some analysts aren't taking the amount of effort required to achieve our goals seriously enough,” he said.

Volkswagen will deliver no new EVs to customers in Europe and the US for the rest of 2022 as it has sold out of battery-powered models.

""We are not sold out because we can't build enough cars, we are sold out for electric cars because demand is higher than we expected initially.

""The pick up for EVs in many markets is really over our expectations. We would love to be able to build a few more cars, waiting times are just too long. You have to wait for your car for a year,"" Diess said.

VW, which includes brands such as Audi, Škoda and Porsche, has shipped more than 99,000 electric cars so far this year.

262,Petco expanding vet ultrasound services with Butterfly partnership,"From babies to puppies, one health tech company is scaling up services to bring ultrasound services not only to rural sub-Saharan Africa but also to your local Petco veterinary clinic.

Butterfly Network (BFLY) announced a collaboration with Petco (WOOF) that would integrate its Butterfly iQ+ Vet, a handheld single probe imaging system, to help streamline pet diagnoses at more than 200 pet clinics nationally.

Petco sees its partnership with Butterfly as a long-term strategy and a step into greater digital health for vet services.

""We're on a very aggressive growth path with our veterinary services, especially opening new full service veterinary hospitals,"" Dr. Whitney Miller, Petco's chief veterinarian, told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview.

""The pandemic has brought a lot of excitement in the tech space, but it's also brought a lot of challenges ... with supply chain, and rolling out at our scale can be a challenge,"" she said.

And Butterfly, a health tech company founded in 2011 and backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is already seeing its product used in various settings in more than 45 locations globally.

""I don't think it's a secret that they definitely are a more affordable options than a lot of ultrasound technologies out there,"" Miller said.

Darius Shahida, Butterfly's chief strategy and business development officer, told Yahoo Finance the pandemic has been a catalyst for the company's growth in the vet business.

""The companion animal market is by far the largest of all the segments in animal health. In the last few years, with the pandemic, the number of pets that have been added to American households is actually in the tens of millions. And, of course, you don't have tens of millions of veterinarians that are joining the workforce at the same time,"" he said.

The company estimates the veterinary ultrasound market to be about a $450 million market and one that is clearly underserved amid the pandemic's pet boom.

Story continues

Miller said that the pandemic really changed how pet parents want to access care and talk to their veterinarians.

Butterfly has also made its way into campuses, where medical students are learning how to use the device, Shahida said.

Through Gates Foundation funding, Butterfly has also been able to provide strong use case proof for midwives to perform services, usually limited to bulkier machines by obstetricians, in rural parts of Africa. Shahida sees multiple use case possibilities as Butterfly grows, with the affordability and high-tech functionality of the product makes it even more appealing.

From $2,400 to $2,999, depending on whether for humans or animals, the point-of-care unit is a fraction of the cost of traditional options.

""All of the traditional ultrasound on the market has really been created and engineered as a disconnected device. We can actually focus on the problems we're solving for different specialties, different practitioners and we can rapidly iterate, innovate and improve our solution. Much like a Tesla (TSLA) can improve its hardware performance through software updates. We're doing the same thing,"" Shahida said.

267,Aptiv Shanghai plant suspends some shipments after COVID cases - sources,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Aptiv stopped shipping over the weekend some parts from a Shanghai plant that supplies Tesla Inc and General Motors Co after COVID-19 infections were found among its workers, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

The suspension of shipments from Aptiv could represent a setback to Tesla, which had planned to bring output in Shanghai back to the levels before the city locked down to control a wave of infections and forced a shutdown through much of April.

Aptiv, in a statement to Reuters, did not comment on the status of its Shanghai plant or whether there had been infections among workers.

""The safety of our employees is our first priority,"" Aptiv said. ""We have been in touch with our customers and are working closely with them.""

Tesla and GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tesla restarted production at its Shanghai plant on April 19, with the help of the city government after a 22-day closure, the longest since the factory opened in 2019. The plant makes Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y for the China market and exports.

Aptiv had won approval to restart its factory in late April by implementing a ""closed-loop"" system in which workers are isolated. When it was unable to proceed last month to coincide with Tesla's restart, the delay forced the U.S. EV maker to find more inventory of wire harness, a person with knowledge of the situation said.

Wire harnesses are parts that bundle together cables that can stretch to up to 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) in the average car. Unique to each car model, vehicles cannot be built without them.

The disruption to Tesla's Shanghai plant has been one of the highest profile consequences of China's measures to control its biggest COVID-19 outbreak, which have also crimped consumption, including vehicle sales.

China's auto association said last week it estimated auto sales in China dropped 48% in April as zero-COVID lockdowns shut factories, limited traffic to showrooms and put the brakes on spending.

Shanghai authorities have tightened a city-wide lockdown imposed more than a month ago on the commercial hub with a population of 25 million, a move that could extend curbs on movement through the month.

At this point in the game, investing in Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock means investing in the Chinese government.

If you bought stock in Nio when China was arranging its bailout two years ago, your investment is in good shape. In March 2020, shares bottomed out near $3/share. It opened May 9, at about $14.

If you got in late in 2020, at the time of the government’s technology crackdown, you’re losing money. Shares peaked at over $61 each at the start of 2021.

As a Nio stockholder, your view is colored by when you got in, and what you believed at the time. Was China’s government the savior of your investment, or did they take you for a ride?

That aside, looking at these numbers and competition, NIO stock probably won’t be going the distance.

NIO Nio $13.64

Nio’s Numbers

Nio stock trades in Hong Kong as well as the U.S. Results are reported in Hong Kong dollars. These are currently trading at 7.85 HKD to the U.S. dollar. (The Chinese Yuan trades at 6.73 to the dollar, down sharply from 6.37 a month ago.)

At current exchange rates Nio lost about $1.61 billion in 2021, on revenue of $5.5 billion. Revenue was up 138% from 2020. The best news here was about $302 million in positive operating cash flow. Nio has a market capitalization of $49 billion.

Financial results for that first quarter are due May 13. Revenue is estimated at $1.54 billion with a loss of 16 cents/share. That would be an improvement over the last quarter’s 21 cents/share loss, on similar revenue.

The company reported its first quarter deliveries April 1 at 25,768 cars. It delivered 5,074 more in April. Compare this to 91,429 delivered in all of 2021.

Now let’s put these numbers in context.

The Reality

Nio cars are made by JAC Motors in Hefei. JAC makes a full line of sedans, hatchbacks, and pick-ups. Think of Nio as a luxury electric brand for JAC.

Nio says it wants to be “China’s Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).” But based on delivery numbers, it’s not China’s Tesla. When you read that it’s coming out with a model “competitive” with the Tesla Model 3, know that it’s only making a few of them. Tesla delivered over 300,000 cars in the first quarter of 2022.

If you want to know what globally competitive means for Nio, look at Norway, Europe’s most competitive electric car market. Nio has gotten into that market with plans to sell 7,000 cars over the next two years. Key to making that happen will be infrastructure, specifically battery swaps, which Nio has pioneered in its home market. The idea is that as a battery’s range drops it can be quickly replaced, and the whole car serviced.

If Nio can make it in Norway, the argument goes, it can make it in the U.S. But there will be a lot of competition, including Chinese competition. Geely (OTCMKTS:GELYF), which delivers as many vehicles in China as Tesla does electrics worldwide, now owns Volvo and has a luxury electric brand called Polestar taking orders in the U.S.

The Bottom Line on NIO Stock

Nio has a high public profile in U.S. markets because it came to the New York Stock Exchange in 2019.

That’s not the same thing as being China’s Tesla.

Nio is a luxury brand whose cars are being made by a state-backed company. It aims to export numbers measured in the thousands, while Tesla plans to produce numbers in the millions.

While Nio is slowly ramping up its export infrastructure, better-capitalized rivals in China are doing the same. As is the rest of the auto industry worldwide. Its volumes do not justify the $49 billion market cap.

If you have a profit in Nio stock now, take it. If you don’t, I don’t think it likely you will ever see one.

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - EU industry chief Thierry Breton met Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk in Texas on Monday and the two signalled agreement on EU digital media regulation ahead of Musk's purchase of Twitter Inc .

The meeting comes weeks after the world's richest man clinched a deal to buy the social media company for $44 billion in cash.

In a video with the two men posted on Twitter by Breton, the EU official tells Musk that he explained the Digital Services Act to Musk. ""It fits pretty well with what you think we should do,"" Breton tells Musk in a tweet that included the hashtag #DSA.

""I think it's exactly aligned with my thinking,"" Musk responds.

The two did not go into detail on the new law, which levies hefty fines on companies if they do not control illegal content. The rules ban advertising aimed at children or based on religion, gender, race and political opinions, for example.

Musk secured the deal to buy Twitter last month with a pledge to revitalise the company and expand the number of users by cracking down on spam bots and reducing the amount of moderation to facilitate more ""free speech"".

The billionaire's comments prompted a rejoinder from Breton that Twitter must comply with new EU rules known as the Digital Services Act tackling illegal online content.

Breton and Musk had been expected to discuss global supply chain issues during the EU official's visit to Tesla Inc's new Austin plant. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; additional reporting by Peter Henderson; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Stephen Coates)",2022-05-09T23:53:23+00:00
280,Exclusive-Tesla halts production at Shanghai plant due to supply issues - sources,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Tesla Inc halted production at its Shanghai plant on Monday due to issues with supplies, two people familiar with the matter said.

The suspension comes just three weeks after the U.S. automaker partially resumed production at the Shanghai plant on April 19 following a 22-day closure caused by the city's COVID-19 lockdown, reflecting the complexity and uncertainties of keeping manufacturing going as China battles the coronavirus.

It is unclear when the supply issues can be resolved and when Tesla can resume production, said the people, who declined to be identified as the matter is private. Shanghai is now in its sixth week of lockdown.

Among Tesla suppliers facing issues is wire harness maker Aptiv which had to stop shipping supplies from a plant that supplies Tesla and General Motors after with infections found among its employees, sources said on Monday.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a query for comment.

The company was aiming to increase output at its Shanghai plant to 2,600 cars a day from May 16, Reuters reported previously, as it seeks to restore production to levels before the lockdown.

The disruption to Tesla's Shanghai plant has been one of the highest profile consequences of China's measures to control its biggest COVID-19 outbreak, which have also crimped consumption, including vehicle sales.

China's auto association said last week it estimated auto sales in China dropped 48% in April as zero-COVID lockdowns shut factories, limited traffic to showrooms and put the brakes on spending.

It’s not clear when the supply issues can be resolved or when the electric carmaker can resume production in China, according to the report.

One of the problems stems from a shortage of wire harnesses from Aptiv Plc, which had to stop shipping supplies from a plant that supplies Tesla and General Motors Co. after infections were found among its employees, Reuters said.

Tesla representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tesla’s China factory was shuttered for three weeks in April as Shanghai was plunged into lockdown in an attempt to halt community spread of Covid-19. The plant started up again in late April under a so-called closed loop system whereby workers live on site and are tested regularly.

Prior to the pandemic-induced halt on March 28, Tesla workers in Shanghai were working three shifts covering 24 hours, seven days a week. The workers in the current closed-loop system have been doing 12-hour shifts, six days a week.

Tesla’s Shanghai factory, which in regular times pumps out around 2,100 cars a day, remains challenged by component shortages, other people familiar said last month. The U.S. automaker only has inventory for just over two weeks based on its current closed-loop schedule and logistics are a major problem for many other parts.

284,WRAPUP 1-Tesla stutters under Shanghai lockdown; Beijing keeps hunting COVID,"By David Stanway and Martin Quin Pollard

SHANGHAI/BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - Tesla operated its Shanghai plant well below capacity on Tuesday, showing the problems factories there face trying to ramp up output under a tightening COVID lockdown, while China's capital Beijing kept fighting a small, but elusive outbreak.

Many of the hundreds of companies reopening factories in Shanghai in recent weeks have faced challenges getting production lines back up to speed while keeping workers on-site in a ""closed loop"" system.

Even if they manage to get everything right, such firms depend on suppliers facing similar challenges.

The latest sign of struggle with increasing output under COVID rules came from Tesla's Shanghai plant, whose resumption three weeks ago received generous coverage in state media as an example of what can still be achieved despite restrictions.

The U.S. automaker has halted most of its production at the plant due to problems securing parts, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Tesla had planned as late as last week to increase output to pre-lockdown levels by next week.

Among Tesla suppliers facing difficulties is wire harness maker Aptiv after infections were found among its employees, sources said on Monday.

Videos posted online last week showed dozens of workers at Apple and Tesla supplier Quanta overwhelming hazmat-suited security guards and vaulting over factory gates fearing being trapped inside amid COVID rumours.

COVID curbs in Shanghai, Beijing and dozens of other major population centres and manufacturing hubs across China are taking a heavy toll on the world's second largest economy, with significant global spillovers on trade and supply chains.

Uncertainty about China's economic outlook is high, with economists unable to judge with precision when the country could bring COVID under control and for how long and what the final cost is likely to be.

""Growth in China is likely to remain hostage to the course of the pandemic for most of the year,"" analysts at Fathom Consulting said in a note.

Chinese markets had another tough day on Tuesday.

Shanghai, a vital centre for commerce, finance and manufacturing for China and beyond with a population of 25 million, was enduring its sixth week of a city-wide lockdown.

The prolonged, ruthlessly-enforced isolation increasingly jars with an outside world which is gradually returning to its pre-COVID way of life, even if cases spread.

China has threatened actions against critics of its ""dynamic-zero COVID"" policy, which it says aims to ""put life first"" and prevent the millions of deaths caused by the virus around the globe.

'CRITICAL PERIOD'

The number of new COVID-19 cases in Shanghai have been falling for almost two weeks, but they remain in the thousands and restrictions were tightening.

""We are still in a critical period of epidemic prevention and control,"" said Sun Xiaodong, deputy director of the Municipal Centre for Disease Control.

The city was making what it hoped was a final push to end infections discovered outside areas facing the strictest curbs - the most significant gauge of whether the virus was being brought under control.

While there was no official announcement, many residential compounds received notices that people would no longer be allowed out, having been able to go for brief walks or quick grocery trips previously.

In some cases, entire communities were sent into quarantine over one neighbour testing positive. Many Shanghai residents have to do a rapid antigen test at home, hours before doing the mandatory community PCR test.

Testing is part of daily routine in much of Beijing as well.

The capital has not seen its daily case numbers grow beyond several dozen since its outbreak began on April 22. But it has also found it difficult to bring them down significantly.

So restrictions have gradually tightened.

An area in the southwest of the capital on Monday forbade residents from leaving their neighbourhoods and ordered all activities not related to virus prevention to halt.

Elsewhere, some residents have been told to work from home; dine-in services at restaurants were banned; parks, some malls and other venues were shut; and a significant chunk of public transport routes was suspended.

Investing.com -- Stocks in focus in premarket trade on Tuesday, May 10th. Please refresh for updates.

Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock fell 23% after the vaccine-maker missed earnings and revenue expectations even as it reported its first profitable quarter, citing uncertainty over future orders for its COVID treatment.

Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock fell 27% after the exercise equipment makerreported a sharp fall in third quarter revenue, battered by lower demand for its stationary exercise bikes and tread machines as people returned to gyms.

Vroom  (NASDAQ:VRM) stock rose 38% after the used car retailer posted a smaller than expected quarterly loss and a jump in revenue, adding that chief operating officer Thomas Shortt would become its new CEO.

AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock rose 4.3% after the world’s largest theater chain posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a narrower loss, helped by the release of big-ticket films such as ""The Batman"".

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 1.6%, benefiting from the better overall tone despite the electric car manufacturer announcing the recall of about 130,000 vehicles in the United States following an overheating issue that may cause the center touchscreen display to malfunction.

Biohaven Pharmaceutical (NYSE:BHVN) stock soared over 72% after drugs giant  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), down 0.5%, announced it will buy the migraine drug maker for about $11.6 billion in cash.

286,"Wall Street Opens Sharply Higher, Rebounding from Monday Rout; Dow up 410 Points","By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply higher on Tuesday, recovering around half the losses they made on Monday as fears of a global economic slowdown swept through world markets.

By 9:36 AM ET (1336 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 417 points, or 1.3%, at 32,663 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.4% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.8%.

Aside from the technical element of the rebound, stocks were supported by the absence of any fresh shocks from the first two appearances of the day by Federal Reserve officials, while two big acquisitions acted as a reminder that companies with strong balance sheets are able to thrive in the current environment - and that the recent selloff may have created some valuable buying opportunities.

Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock rose 2.1% after it agreed to buy smaller rival Biohaven (NYSE:BHVN) for $11.8 billion, a premium of some 70% to Monday's close. Meanwhile, Duke Realty (NYSE:DRE) rose 15% after Prologis (NYSE:PLD) offered to buy it in an all-stock deal valuing it at just under $24 billion. Prologis stock rose 0.4%.

New York Fed President John Williams gave no indication of wanting to raise interest rates faster than the Fed has already indicated and said he expected a ""soft landing"" for the economy with only a small rise in unemployment and around 2% gross domestic product growth this year.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was also quoted by newswires as downplaying the risk of a sharp rise in unemployment, although she repeated that rates will have to rise above their 'neutral' level to bring inflation down to its 2% target.

It wasn't all plain sailing, however. Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock slumped another 20% to a new all-time low after reporting it lost over $750 million in the last three months, forcing it to borrow an equal amount to shore up its balance sheet while the hoped-for turnaround materializes. The stock was already down 90% from its peak and is now down 60% from its IPO price less than three years ago. Another fallen angel, AI-focused lender Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST), fell 56% as it was forced to slash its guidance for the coming year.

Story continues

Also falling heavily was Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX), which slumped 12.4% after the company warned of low take-up for its COVID-19 vaccine from the low-income countries that it had targeted. It still upheld its previous guidance for 2022.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock eked out a modest 2% gain after falling some 8% on Monday, held back by news that it has had to cut down production at its Shanghai factory again to barely 10% of capacity. Shanghai's lockdown, now in its eighth week in one form or another, has left the factory short of essential components.

295,"Sorry GME Stock Fans, There’s Still Little to Like About GameStop","GameStop (GME) stock remains unappealing from a fundamental perspective.  The NFT angle looks less and less likely as the market evolves in 2022.  Stock split news isn’t going to sway any investors.

Investors in GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock are looking for reasons to remain upbeat despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. As much as I’d like to be a contrarian and say that GameStop is a worthwhile investment, I can’t.

GameStop is the original meme stock and it’s proving to be very resilient even as multiple forces weigh against it. Even though it hasn’t fallen back to pre-pandemic levels below $10 like many analysts have speculated, that still seems to be the direction that it’s headed.

As we’re all aware, 2022 is very different from 2021. The forces that propped GameStop up in 2021 aren’t present anymore.  That implies that GameStop will continue to head downward. GameStop has a powerful contingent behind it. Retail investors could very well serve to keep prices elevated for some time. Sooner or later, though, fundamental truths are going to catch up to the company. When it happens, GME stock will experience a capital exodus.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

GME GameStop $98.79

Fundamental Lack of Appeal

The reason to be pessimistic about GameStop is much the same reason to be pessimistic about mini growth stocks right now. Despite the fact that these companies continue to experience a top-line turnaround, they also continue to experience widening losses.

4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for May 2022

For the 52 weeks that ended in January 2022, GameStop posted revenues of $6 billion. That represented strong growth over the same period a year earlier when GameStop posted $5.1 billion in revenues.

But investors would be hard-pressed to remain optimistic given that the company’s net loss has reached $381 million dollars. A year earlier during the same period, GameStop’s net losses only reached $215 million.

Story continues

This isn’t a deep fundamental analysis. Rather, it is a recognition that the company faces a far different investment environment this year than last. Readers are well aware now that increasing revenues can’t trump widening losses when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. No matter what your thoughts about GameStop’s ascendance, you have to recognize at some point that capital will stop flowing into speculative investments like GameStop.

Will NFTs Help GME Stock?

Back in late March, GameStop announced that it was going to build an NFT marketplace. When the company made the announcement, it was noted that the marketplace would be open by sometime in July. The markets reacted positively to the news, and the stock’s price jumped to nearly $200.

Those prices have since come down as the market for cryptocurrency and NFTs have somewhat soured. But GameStop investors shouldn’t be very enthusiastic about the NFT angle in any case.

A report from the data website NonFungible shows that NFT sales are down 92% since September. The problem isn’t only that speculative investments are getting trashed as interest rates rise. Rather, it’s also a consequence of market dynamics specific to NFTs themselves.

Essentially, the supply of NFTs far outstripped the demand. One report suggests that there were 9 million NFTs created, but that of those 9 million, only 2 million have been sold. It seems that NFT creators simply became far too overzealous.

So the idea that GameStop’s marketplace for NFTs is going to be a hit seems unlikely. Even if it is introduced in July, there’s probably not going to be much selling occurring. And the selling that does occur won’t garner the prices GameStop was seeking when it hatched the idea to create an NFT marketplace in the first place.

Stock Split News

GameStop is also considering undertaking a stock split. The details of that proposed stock split remain murky. However, it should remain uninteresting in any case.

GameStop is not Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Those companies can undertake stock splits that remain logical and compelling. Their massive stock prices necessitate such a move. If investors can suddenly buy Alphabet shares at $150 apiece, that is fundamentally appealing. It changes the psychology because of price. GameStop is nothing like them. It is not particularly high-priced and remains very attainable. The news that it is undertaking a potential stock split shouldn’t excite investors in the same way that those tech companies should.

What to Do With GME Stock

Just to summarize briefly, GameStop doesn’t look to have much going for it these days. Fundamentally it’s unappealing, its NFT marketplace doesn’t look to have legs, and the stock split news is fundamentally different from that which is appealing. Expect it to continue to fall, and don’t buy in.

296,Elon Musk Says Twitter Will Comply With EU Content Rules After Takeover,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the leading officials from the European Union paid a visit to Elon Musk in Texas, and came away convinced the billionaire will keep Twitter Inc. on the right side of lawmakers.

After meeting Musk on Monday, Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said that he and the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer agreed on everything.

“To tell you the truth, there was definitely no disagreement -- none,” Breton told Bloomberg in an interview.

Musk said Twitter would comply with the European Union’s rules on content if he completes his proposed takeover, despite his plans to loosen restrictions on the network.

Breton is one of the first major tech regulators to discuss Musk’s proposed $44 billion takeover of Twitter -- at least publicly. The EU is one of the fiercest regulators of major tech firms, and has previously launched scathing attacks on prominent founders including Mark Zuckerberg.

Breton previously warned that Twitter, even after a change of ownership, would have to comply with the EU’s new digital content rules.

Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, has criticized Twitter’s content moderation policies, saying he will focus on “free speech” values.

However, Musk is aligned with the EU especially on the idea of making the algorithms more transparent, and on requiring companies to have consistent rules about banning people from platforms.

“I agree with everything you said, really,” Musk said in a video post after the two met in Texas. “I think we’re very much on the same line.”

Twitter, Musk and Why Online Speech Gets Moderated: QuickTake

The European Union agreed on the Digital Services Act last month, aiming to force tech platforms to better police content. The rules mainly focus on taking down illegal content like terrorist posts and hate speech, but could also affect tech companies’ algorithms to down-rank harmful posts, such as messages harassing others or promoting eating disorders.

Story continues

Twitter has become more active in flagging and taking down content in recent years due to increasing public scrutiny. The platform famously banned former U.S. President Donald Trump from the site last year for inciting violence. The move provoked condemnation from conservatives in the U.S., who argued the ban hindered free speech.

Musk’s purchase of the platform could mark a shift in how Twitter mediates content disputes, eschewing rapid take-downs in favor of promoting a broadly open platform.

Musk however has said he believes the platform should follow the rules of each country it operates in. “In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country,” Musk said in April at a TED conference before Twitter accepted his bid to buy the platform.

Breton confirmed that Musk understood that the EU’s rules require that what is illegal offline should be illegal online. Breton told Bloomberg that Musk “was very comfortable” with what Europe was doing. “He was pretty much aligned with the philosophy of what we have done in Europe.”

It is yet to be seen to what extent European regulators will push platforms like Twitter to do more on harmful content including disinformation and harassment. Very large platforms like Twitter will be required to submit annual reports to the EU detailing what they are doing to combat legal but harmful content on their platform.

If companies are not doing enough, the EU could require companies down-rank certain content or change their algorithms.

There’s also the prospect of major financial penalties if Musk and the EU disagree. If the company doesn’t comply with the DSA, the EU can issue fines of as much as 6% of a company’s annual revenue and even ban the platform from operating in the bloc.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Tesla Inc is recalling about 130,000 vehicles in the United States following an overheating issue that may cause the center touchscreen display to malfunction, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Tuesday.

The recall covers Tesla's S and X from the 2021 and 2022 model years and its 3 and Y from the 2022 model year. The electric vehicle maker will provide an over-the-air software update to resolve the issue, according to the NHTSA.

Tesla told NHTSA it was aware of 59 warranty claims and 59 field reports received since January that may be related to the issue but no reports of crashes or injuries related to the issue.

Tesla recalled 48,000 Model 3 Performance vehicles in the U.S. in April for an issue that may not display the speedometer when in ""Track Mode"".

Tesla has issued a number of recalls for camera-related issues. In March, Tesla recalled 947 vehicles in the United States because the rearview image may not immediately display when they begin to reverse.

In December, Tesla recalled 356,309 of its 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles to address rearview camera issues.

The NHTSA said ""the rearview camera cable harness may be damaged by the opening and closing of the trunk lid, preventing the rearview camera image from displaying.""

Tesla has issued 11 recalls this year, tied with Chrysler parent Stellantis for fourth most in 2022.

TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it would suspend operations on 14 lines at eight domestic factories for up to six days in May due to the COVID lockdown in China.

The duration will be between May 16 and May 21, the company said, expanding the number of lines and factories affected by partial suspension to a total of 20 and 12, respectively.

It also slashed global production target for the month by around 50,000 to 700,000.

It did not provide an estimate for lost production in a statement.

Source: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com

Monday picked up where last week left off on Wall Street with the major averages hitting year-to-date lows. And Shanghai-based electric vehicle (EV) play Nio (NYSE:NIO) didn’t prove immune to the bearish behavior as NIO stock fell more than 9% in the session.

This week’s bearish start. Last week’s miserable finish. April’s punishing retreat or simply an awful 2022 for risk assets. Most investors will agreeably point fingers at Covid-19 and Russia as global economies wrestle with rocketing inflation, hawkish monetary policy and supply chain snarls which appear to grow worse daily. And Nio’s year-to-date (YTD) decline of 56% reflects those bad actors and more.

But unless Fred Flintstone’s foot-powered vehicle is set to make a comeback, today’s NIO stock is demanding investors consider buying shares. So, let’s look at what else is happening, off and on the price chart, and how a more calculated purchase in Nio might be approached.

NIO Stock Comes Unplugged

Make no mistake, Nio has other specific, but broader market fears that have weighed on shares in 2022, and helped drag the stock down about 80% since last January’s all-time-high of $66.99.

4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for May 2022

One boogeyman in question is investors’ collective retreat out of higher multiple growth stocks. That phenomenon began last February just after NIO stock peaked, and this year it’s snowballed into an even larger drag with tighter monetary policy now underway.

Secondly and as a China-based American Depository Receipt, Nio shares have been a victim of political and regulatory saber rattling against Chinese companies over the past year. And last week those durable fears against NIO stock did seemingly receive some validation.

NIO stock, along with Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), JD (NASDAQ:JD) and others, were placed on a list of 88 Chinese companies with delisting risk. And in the wake of the report’s release investors sent shares of NIO down more than 15% in a single session.

The good news is the report wasn’t an indictment against NIO. And according to Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), “pronounced weakness from delisting headlines” are a buying opportunity in Nio shares.

Unless investors fearfully suspect accounting irregularities will suddenly appear, fail to appreciate NIO stock’s Hong Kong listing as a positive liquidity feature or believe Covid-driven near-term supply chain disruptions are a sign of long-term problems –the case for buying Nio is an increasingly strong one.

Today, the bear market in NIO stock has led to shares trading much closer to a historical trough and presenting relative value versus EV giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with shares fetching just over four times sales compared to TSLA stock’s 16 time multiple.

Further and at a market capitalization of $26 billion, NIO is offering investors the chance to buy shares at a fraction of TSLA stock’s $815 billion valuation despite three new competing models hitting the road this year.

To be fair, Nio shares won’t make a dye-in-the-wool value investor smile. And more challenging right now, investors that purchase NIO stock are choosing to buy growth when it’s out-of-favor in a gloomy and doubtful environment.

But demand for Nio’s popular EVs remains huge and longer-term sales growth shouldn’t be dismissed. In fact, if the EV maker’s supply chain can normalize next year, sales could quadruple by 2024 and even achieve sustainable profitability according to The Motley Fool.

Positioning in NIO Stock Nio (NIO) challenging key monthly hammer support with signs of failure warning of lower NIO stock prices

Fearful market behavior has also led to NIO stock testing its March’s bullish monthly reversal hammer candlestick. After narrowly confirming a bullish buy decision in April as shares traded through $23.86, Nio is about 4% from taking out the bottoming candle’s low of $13.01 and zone support from roughly $13 – $19.

With stochastics flatlining in oversold territory and NIO’s lower Bollinger band beginning to open from a flattened position, a full-blown retreat to Nio’s Covid bear market low might appear credible on the price chart. But rather than panic, now is actually a better time to start accumulating shares or considering an actively-managed collar in NIO stock.

In order for NIO stock to revisit its Covid lows, shares would need to unravel another 85% and compress in valuation to around $4 billion. Realistically though, that’s highly unlikely to happen. And attempting to cherry pick a bottom, as Nio’s volatile monthly candlesticks can attest, comes with its own degree of difficulty.

Given NIO’s revenues last year amounted to $5.671 billion and more than five-fold 2019’s pre-Covid sales of $1.124 billion, even if hamstrung buyers or supply chain problems turn into larger issues, only a consumer movement towards foot-powered transportation at the expense of EVs could push NIO stock towards the low single digits. And bottom-line, that’s only probable in investors imagination or an episode of The Flintstones.

309,Elon Musk’s Tesla factory workers sleeping on-site and working 12-hour shifts six days a week,"Workers at the Tesla factory in Shanghai have reportedly been sleeping on-site and working 12-hour shifts with just one day off per week.

With the Chinese government continuing to pursue its zero-COVID strategy, Shanghai has been stuck in lockdown for more than six weeks, leading to new disruptions in production for the U.S. carmaker.

Reuters reported that output at the Gigafactory 3 plant had been halted, but Tesla said it had received no notice the factory had ceased to operate and that some cars were still being made there.

An internal memo seen by Reuters claims the factory will manufacture fewer than 200 vehicles on Tuesday, a massive drop from the roughly 1,200 units it has been building each day since reopening on April 19.

In late March, Tesla’s Shanghai plant was shut down as the city grappled with a surge in COVID cases caused by the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the virus.

But in April, the company was permitted to resume operations under China’s so-called closed-loop system, under which a company's employees live on-site and are tested regularly, enabling the firm to operate while preventing outbreaks of the coronavirus.

Prior to the lockdown, workers at Tesla’s Shanghai plant worked three shifts covering 24 hours, seven days a week, Bloomberg reported.

But under the closed-loop system, employees are working 12-hour shifts, six days a week, according to Bloomberg.

A spokesperson for Tesla was not available for comment when contacted by Fortune.

The plant’s workforce was reportedly sent a memo before it entered into the closed-loop system, detailing what employees could expect.

The company said at the time that it would provide workers with a mattress and sleeping bag, with employees having to sleep on the floor due to there being no purpose-built dorm.

Other spaces would be designated for entertainment, showering, and dining, the memo said.

Until recently, Tesla was reliant on two factories—its plants in California and Shanghai—for the production of its vehicles.

Story continues

The electric vehicle maker opened factories in Berlin and Texas in March and April respectively, with the latter serving as the company’s new global headquarters.

Employees living at their place of work in Shanghai isn’t a phenomenon unique to Tesla: As the city’s stringent lockdown measures rage on, authorities have been encouraging companies to adopt the closed-loop system to keep the economy going.

More than 20,000 bankers and traders in the city were reported to have been living at their offices last month, as financial services firms adopted the closed-loop system.

Meanwhile, Shanghai Port, the world’s busiest seaport, is reported to have maintained a 24-hour operation by implementing the policy.

When the city’s lockdown began at the end of March, General Motors’ joint venture with China’s SAIC Motorreportedly told employees at its Shanghai plant to sleep on the factory floor so that production could continue.

And workers who were locked in at Volkswagen’s Shanghai plant were reportedly treated to movie nights when they moved into the factory.

Spokespeople for GM and Volkswagen were not available for comment.

316,Cathie Wood shocks the market after dumping $12.7 million of Tesla stock to snap up some in General Motors,"Tesla perma-bull Cathie Wood shocked investors on Tuesday after it emerged she had trimmed her holdings in Elon Musk’s electric vehicle manufacturer to buy stock in legacy rival General Motors.

Wood has become something of a tech industry oracle for retail investors thanks to her early and aggressive bets on disruptive technologies like EVs, and Tesla has traditionally been her top holding.

On Monday, however, the ARK Invest firm she manages as CEO and chief investment officer revealed it had sold 15,862 shares in Musk’s company, worth about $12.7 million, while buying 158,157 shares in GM for nearly $6.1 million, among other portfolio adjustments.

While Wood occasionally takes profits on Tesla, also to ensure the fund doesn’t become too top-heavy from the trillion-dollar megacap, the move is striking as even a high-quality name like Tesla has found itself in a slump owing to Musk’s planned acquisition of Twitter.

Moreover, ARK Invest itself released research last month that included an extremely bullish price target of $4,600 per share for Tesla in 2026—hardly a signal to markets Wood might shift some of her portfolio toward an incumbent like General Motors.

“Hell has officially frozen over,” tweeted Stanphyl Capital fund manager Mark Spiegel, one of the fiercest critics of both Tesla and Wood.

Wood however didn’t buy shares in GM because of its exposure to the growing EV market.

The company has in fact been heavily mocked by Tesla fans for selling just 483 electric vehicles in its domestic U.S. market over a six-month period through the end of March.

In fact, GM shares were added not to the flagship ARK Innovation ETF, but to her ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF. That’s because the Detroit carmaker is at the forefront of robotaxi development thanks to its 80% stake in Cruise.

Wood however continues to concentrate some of the highest risk, highest return stocks in one portfolio, undeterred by market weakness.

‘Deep value territory’

Story continues

In December she claimed that some of her favorite names, such as telemedicine service provider Teladoc, were poised for an eventual rebound after recent routs.

“Innovation stocks are not in a bubble: We believe they are in deep value territory,” she wrote at the time.

Unfortunately for Wood, an inflation-fighting Federal Reserve has for the moment proved otherwise. Its aggressive preparations for a tightening cycle have turned out to be kryptonite for growth-stock–heavy funds like her own.

On top of the Fed poisoning über-bullish market sentiment on Wall Street, her reputation for stock picking has also suffered despite her long-term conviction in Tesla.

In the run-up to Teladoc’s Q1 results, she added to her position in the company, which already counted her as its largest investor.

The bet blew up in her face when the stock promptly lost half its value. The company revealed a larger than expected quarterly loss after effectively admitting it had overpaid $6.6 billion for the takeover of Livongo.

As a result, ARK Innovation is trading at levels not seen since the March 2020 lows when the pandemic first erupted. Currently it’s trading down 5% on Tuesday.

A deeply religious Christian known for her close friendship with Bill Hwang, Wood recently revealed she had founded ARK Invest with the help of the convicted Archegos hedge fund manager.

320,Musk says he would reverse Twitter ban on Donald Trump,"By Sheila Dang

(Reuters) -Billionaire Elon Musk said Tuesday he would reverse Twitter's ban on former U.S. President Donald Trump when he buys the social media platform, the clearest signal of Musk's intention to cut moderation of the site.

Musk, the world's richest person and chief executive of Tesla Inc, has inked a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. He has called himself a ""free speech absolutist"" but given few specific details of his plans.

Musk is expected to become Twitter's temporary CEO after closing the deal, Reuters previously reported according to a source familiar with the matter.

The question of reinstating Trump has been seen as a litmus test of how far Musk will go in making changes.

Musk, speaking to the Financial Times Future of the Car conference, added that he and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey believe permanent bans should be ""extremely rare"" and reserved for accounts that operate bots or spread spam.

Musk said the decision to ban Trump amplified his views among people on the political right, and he called the ban ""morally wrong and flat-out stupid.""

The suspension of Trump’s account, which had more than 88 million followers, silenced his primary megaphone days before the end of his term and follows years of debate about how social media companies should moderate the accounts of powerful global leaders.

Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter shortly after the Jan. 6 riot on the U.S. Capitol. Twitter cited ""the risk of further incitement of violence"" in its decision.

'OUGHT TO BE EVERYWHERE'

Conservatives, who have accused San Francisco-based Twitter of bias against right-leaning views, have cheered the prospect of Trump’s return.

""He (Trump) ought to be everywhere he can,"" Republican Senator Rick Scott told reporters when asked about Musk's comments.

""We ought to have free speech in this country. We shouldn't have social media companies that are restricting people's ability to get their message out,"" added Scott.

Story continues

Democrats have said Trump’s potential reinstatement could constitute a threat to democracy, although some hope that a frequently-tweeting Trump could upset their base and rev up turnout in the November midterm congressional elections.

Twitter declined to comment.

Trump had previously told Fox News that he would not return to Twitter even if Musk purchases the platform and reinstates his account, and said he would use his own social media app called Truth Social, a Twitter-like platform that launched on the Apple app store in lat February and in which users post ""truths"" instead of tweets.

Trump has revved up his messaging on the new platform after a slow start, posting about 50 times, mostly in the last week, to his 2.7 million followers.

The platform is owned by Trump Media & Technology Group, which is led by Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman. There was no immediate comment from a Trump spokesperson.

During the conference, Musk said the deal to acquire Twitter could be done in two to three months in the ""best case scenario."" But he added Twitter has not yet filed the proxy for a shareholder vote to approve the deal, and there were still outstanding questions that needed to be resolved.

Earlier on Tuesday, Twitter shares fell to a level that indicated the stock market took the view for the first time that it was unlikely that Musk would make the acquisition for $44 billion, as he originally agreed.

Banning former US president Donald Trump from Twitter was a “mistake”, according to future Twitter (TWTR) owner Elon Musk, who added he would reverse the ban.

The decision to ban Trump from the social media platform was ""morally wrong and flat-out stupid,"" Tesla (TSLA) boss Musk said at the Financial Times Future of the Car conference.

“It was not correct to ban Donald Trump. I think that was a mistake,” he said, while arguing that the permanent ban “alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice.”

Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter shortly after the 6 January riot on the US Capitol.

“I would reverse the permanent ban,” Musk said. “I don’t own Twitter yet. So this is not like a thing that will definitely happen, because what if I don’t own Twitter?”

Musk said he had spoken to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who agreed that permanents bans are not the solution.

“Permanent bans should be extremely rare and really reserved for accounts that are bots, or scam, spam accounts…” he said.

Trump has publicly said he would not return to the social media platform and will instead use his own platform, Truth Social.

The Tesla boss said tweets that are wrong or bad “should be deleted and a temporary suspension is appropriate, but not a permanent ban”.

He also highlighted some of the changes he would make, if he is successful in buying the company for $44bn (£35.7bn).

Musk said he would like to put the algorithm on GitHub and allow anyone to make suggestions and for human interventions to be highlighted, stating that “you really want transparency to build trust.”

He also said he wants to reduce the left-leaning bias of the San Francisco-based company.

“They’re just coming at it from an environment that is very far left. But it fails to build trust in the rest of the United States and perhaps other parts of the world.”

332,UPDATE 1-Elon Musk says Tesla open to buying a mining company,"(Adds background)

By Ernest Scheyder

May 10 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is open to buying a mining company if producing its own supply of electric vehicle (EV) metals would speed up worldwide adoption of clean energy technologies, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Tuesday.

Concern is mounting across the EV industry that there may not be enough supply of lithium, nickel, copper and other metals to match demand later this decade, fueling questions about whether Tesla would consider jumping into the mining sector.

While the auto giant has EV metals contracts with suppliers across the globe, its goal to produce 20 million vehicles annually by 2030 - what Musk called an ""aspiration, not a promise"" - will require vastly more supplies of metals. Tesla produced just under 1 million EVs last year.

Other automakers and executives including Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Tesla rival Stellantis NV, have warned the auto industry faces a metals supply shortage.

Tesla has no experience with the time-intensive and laborious task of building and operating a mine, so industry analysts have advised the automaker to focus on buying an existing operator.

Many in the mining industry have noted that buying an existing metals producer would cost far less than the $43 billion Musk offered to personally buy social media network Twitter Inc earlier this year.

Tesla has lithium supply deals with Ganfeng Lithium Co , Livent Corp and Albemarle Corp, among others. The company's lithium supply deal with Piedmont Lithium Inc was put on hold last year.

Tesla has nickel supply deals with Vale SA and Talon Metals Corp.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Tesla (TSLA) Daily chart of TSLa stock

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock broke the April low on Monday and despite Tuesday’s rally, this level acted as resistance on the day. That said, Tesla is holding the 21-month moving average as support.

We’re in a tight two-day range and that can be said for a lot of stocks right now. If the stock can go daily-up over Tuesday’s high and reclaim the April high in the process, we could be looking at a quick move back to the $870 area. Above that gets us $900 and the 200-day.

On the downside, keep a close watch on this week’s low. A break of this level and a failure to reclaim it could open the door down to the March low near $756, then this year’s low at $700.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) top stock trades for PANW

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider

You may remember Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) from a few weeks ago, where I explained that it was breaking support but I was hesitant to be a seller in this name given its relative strength.

Specifically, I said: “If this continues lower though, $550 is not out of the question. A real hammering puts $500 in play (and would have me wishing I didn’t call PANW a short). Aggressive shorts can use $570 as their stop-loss.”

Well, it’s true — I regret it.

Anyone who did sell this name made out well as it dropped all the way into the $450s. From here, it just undercut the January low and is reversing nicely.

If PANW stock can reclaim the 50-week moving average, it can fill the gap at $500. Above that could open the door to the 10-week and 21-week moving averages up near $550.

However, should the stock continue lower and take out the recent lows, the $400 breakout area could be on the table.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: SoFi Technologies (SOFI) Top stock trades for SOFI

This was a weird one, with SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) sinking earlier in the day, then getting halted just after 11:15 after accidentally releasing its earnings in the middle of the day.

The stock is rallying on the results, though, after hitting new all-time lows earlier in the day.

On the upside, I want to see how SoFi handles $6. Assuming it can get there, this was a prior support area until today. Above that puts the May high in play near $7.15. That’s followed by $7.73.

On the downside, though, the main levels to watch are $5 and Tuesday’s low. A break of the former puts the latter in play and below the latter puts SoFi stock in no man’s land.

AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) was on my go-to list for most of this year because of its relative strength. After stabilizing following a tough pullback, this one is back in play. However, we have to wait for the setup.

After an inside week and following earnings, an inside-and-up weekly rotation over $153.50 is in the cards. It tried today but couldn’t hold. If it can do it again and clear the 10-week moving average, $160 to $162 could be in the cards as a trim spot.

335,Can Tesla Become an Industrial Powerhouse? Morgan Stanley Thinks So,"“Tesla (TSLA) is overvalued” phrase is one used in abundance and when looking at the company from several angles, Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas thinks that it might be apt.

“There are clear areas where we wish market expectations would be lowered,” says the analyst. Which ones, then? Well, given input cost inflation, auto margin expectations are “too high,” and the market is also too optimistic on FSD (full-self driving) with Jonas believing L4/L5 autonomy at scale is “well over a decade away.” And don’t bank on China, either, as the future there is “highly uncertain.”

That said, there are other less lauded aspects of Tesla that demand greater attention. It is the part Tesla is expected to play in “building-out” the US and West Europe’s renewable energy infrastructure, that is “underappreciated,” and what investors should really be taking notice of is Tesla's “leadership in the Mother of All Capex Cycles (the MACC).”

The world might be currently gripped both by inflation and war, but looking at the bright side of these macro negatives, Jonas thinks the result will be “energy innovation.”

“The lack of energy supply (both structural and idiosyncratic, renewable and fossil) ranks high amongst global challenges,” says Jonas and what the global renewable energy infrastructure and supply chain needs is a complete overhaul; through 2040, this will call for as much as 20 to 40 TWh of battery capacity and $10 to $20 trillion of “accumulated capex spend.”

And portfolios with names “exposed to this capex cycle can drive powerful alpha.”

As such, while the upside for Tesla based on other verticals might be capped, there is another opportunity.

“We think attributes like AI, autonomous and EV are fully if not over-appreciated here,” opined the 5-star analyst. “In fact, we believe Tesla's more 'gritty' capabilities in terms of manufacturing, material sourcing, supply chain and infrastructure will drive the next leg of growth to the story. Tesla's prowess as a tech company is known. Enter the industrial powerhouse?”

Story continues

To this end, Jonas reiterated an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating backed by a $1,300 price target. Should the figure be met, investors are looking at upside of 62%. (To watch Jonas’ track record, click here)

Tesla elicits a wide spectrum of opinions and that is reflected by the current Street ratings. With 14 Buys, 8 Holds and 5 Sells, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Moderate Buy. The average price target currently stands at $977.54, implying shares will climb 22% higher in the year ahead. (See Tesla stock forecast on TipRanks)

By Ernest Scheyder

May 10 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is open to buying a mining company if producing its own supply of electric vehicle (EV) metals would speed up worldwide adoption of clean energy technologies, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Tuesday.

Concern is mounting across the EV industry that there may not be enough supply of lithium, nickel, copper and other metals to match demand later this decade, fueling questions about whether Tesla would consider jumping into the mining sector.

""It's not out of the question,"" Musk told the FT Future of the Car 2022 conference. ""We will address whatever limitations are on accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. It's not that we wish to buy mining companies, but if that's the only way to accelerate the transition, then we will do that.""

338,Apollo Plans to Lead $1 Billion Financing for Musk’s Twitter Bid,"(Bloomberg) -- Apollo Global Management Inc. is in talks to lead a preferred financing for Elon Musk’s proposed buyout of Twitter Inc., according to people with knowledge of the deal.

The funding, arranged by Morgan Stanley, will exceed $1 billion and may include Sixth Street Partners, among other firms, the people said.

Apollo, Sixth Street and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Shares of Twitter closed Tuesday at $47.26 apiece, with traders growing more skeptical that Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., will complete the purchase at the $54.20 offer price.

That’s despite Musk revealing last week he’s getting $7.1 billion in equity commitments from investors including Larry Ellison, Sequoia Capital and Qatar. He persuaded Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal to roll his $1.9 billion of Twitter stock into the privatized company and is seeking to do the same with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.

It’s not clear how the preferred equity might change the existing financing proposal, which requires Musk and his partners to contribute $27.25 billion in equity to fund the $44 billion purchase, with the rest coming from junk-rated debt and a margin loan tied to Musk’s Tesla stock.

Preferred equity is a hybrid of debt and equity capital that sits above common equity in the capital structure. Some preferred equity is convertible into common shares at a pre-agreed price.

Musk recently boosted his cash position by selling Tesla stock -- about $8.5 billion in the latest round -- and he’s already amassed 9.6% of Twitter’s outstanding shares.

Story continues

Musk is the world’s richest person with a net worth of $231.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, but much of that fortune is illiquid. Tesla’s stock has tumbled 26% since Musk announced his desire to buy Twitter, stoking concerns among investors that he may need to sell or pledge considerable amounts of stock to fund the bid.

Ordinarily, you don’t want to attempt to catch a falling knife simply for its own sake. Sure, in some narrowly defined contexts, you can get away with it. However, when publicly traded companies — particularly those labeled as growth stocks — shed massive double-digit losses, there’s usually a reason for it. Nevertheless, the present volatility provides possible upside returns for the long run.

The emphasis here is the long run.

And that really sums up the theme for today. Recently, we’ve seen the equities sector tumble due to myriad fears, ranging from recession to inflation to war. Ultimately, cooler heads may prevail (as it always has throughout human history) but when that will occur is anyone’s guess. Therefore, you can position yourself into these heavily discounted growth stocks but with the understanding that you’ve got to be patient.

7 Retirement Stocks to Buy in May 2022

If you can accept the risks — and have the time to see through the ambiguous waters ahead — you might want to check out these growth stocks to buy on the dip.

Ticker Company Current Price BE Bloom Energy $13.10 RIVN Rivian Automotive $22.11 LYFT Lyft $18.34 BILL Bill.com $100.35 SE Sea $63.30 DNA Ginkgo Bioworks $2.28 WULF TeraWulf $2.95

Bloom Energy (BE)

In my opinion, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) may be the perfect example of growth stocks to buy that battle-hardened contrarian investors are eyeballing. On the surface, BE stock seems the antithesis of a reasonable investment. Recently, the fuel-cell specialist released its earnings report for the first quarter and it wasn’t pleasant.

The highlight (or perhaps the lowlight) of the disclosure was Bloom Energy’s earnings-per-share, which came in at a loss of 32 cents. This figure compared poorly to the EPS loss of 11 cents that covering analysts were targeting. Further, in the year-ago quarter, Bloom presented comparatively superior optics, posting an EPS loss of 7 cents.

Still, with an aspirational and growth-oriented company like Bloom, you must focus on the bigger picture. In particular, the company’s AlwaysON microgrid solution could empower energy resilience, a circumstance that has been socially and economically problematic since the beginning of the new normal.

But with energy becoming an even more critical topic amid geopolitical flashpoints in Europe? In this context, BE is very interesting if you can handle the volatility.

Rivian Automotive (RIVN)

Let me be upfront that I haven’t been particularly enthused about electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN). It’s not that I dislike the company per say. However, with so many EV companies now competing in the heavily contested arena, it’s unlikely (in my view) that they’ll all succeed.

I mean, let’s face reality here. The average household income for those purchasing EVs is about $140,000. That’s basically twice the U.S. average. Yet there are so many EV competitors in the space, all fighting for a narrow piece of the consumer pie. It doesn’t seem realistic.

Ironically enough, it’s Rivian’s management team that appears to be more in line with reality than some of its rabid followers. Recently, it disclosed risks regarding supply chain pressures and the rising cost of raw materials.

Despite the bad news, though, Rivian does make some attractive EVs. Considering that it’s not competing in the middle-income consumer bracket, Rivian could steal some market share from premium brands like Telsa (NASDAQ:TSLA). Still, RIVN is one of the growth stocks that will require nerves of steel.

Lyft (LYFT)

From a cursory perspective, it might be hard to understand why ride-sharing platform Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) suffered significant losses following its Q1 earnings disclosure. Just by the numbers, the performance was quite solid. For instance, Lyft posted revenue of $875.6 million in Q1, beating out the consensus target calling for $845.5 million.

So, what gives? Although companies love to celebrate past achievements, Wall Street is forward looking. Therefore, management’s softened guidance for Q2 convinced stakeholders to hit the exits. Essentially, the downgraded outlook reflected the worries of our time, namely inflation and rising energy costs. Subsequently, such headwinds could negatively affect consumer sentiment, which wouldn’t be conducive for LYFT and other similarly exposed growth stocks.

However, if you’re an optimistic contrarian with a patient mindset, you might want to give LYFT stock another look with these discounted levels. Given the roughly two years Americans spent cooped up in their homes, the concept of revenge travel is strong. Therefore, LYFT could be among the growth stocks to receive a downwind benefit.

Bill.com (BILL)

A San Jose, California-based technology firm that provides automated, cloud-based software for financial operations, Bill.com (NYSE:BILL) is quickly becoming a go-to platform for the burgeoning gig economy. From the perspective of gig workers, it’s a convenient 21st century timeclock: punch in your hours worked (or whatever business metric that’s used) and off you go.

Although it’s a relevant innovation, BILL stock is suffering a rather antithetical experience. On a year-to-date basis, BILL is down 57%, with much of the losses stemming from a mixed earnings report. Although the underlying company enjoyed record customer additions, revenue in the most recently completed quarter grew by only 6.6% year-over-year. That was a much lower growth compared to the double-digit numbers seen in prior quarters.

7 Great Growth Stocks to Buy in May

Therefore, stakeholders took the hint: Bill.com is struggling in the post-pandemic era. However, working from home may be coming to an end because the catalyzing public health crisis is also waning. If so, the reluctant workers could join the gig economy permanently, which may support BILL as one of the growth stocks to buy.

Sea (SE)

A tech conglomerate firm headquartered in Singapore, Sea (NYSE:SE) remains one of the most frustrating ideas among growth stocks to buy. On one hand, the company is extraordinarily compelling because of its relevance to the emerging markets of Southeast Asia. But on the other hand, SE has to demonstrate this potential with positive returns.

Well, SE is returning something but nothing good across recent time frames. For instance, on a YTD basis, SE has dropped a staggering 71%. And this isn’t just a victimization of arbitrary context. Indeed, you have to go back to late May 2020 to when SE stock was trading hands this low.

If I’m being honest, it appears that the acceleration of negativity isn’t yet over. It wouldn’t be surprising to see SE drop near pandemic-lows of around $40. But if it does get that low, the $1 trillion internet economy for Southeast Asia that experts project will materialize by 2030 is enough to put me in the contrarian’s chair.

Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA)

Although an intriguing concept, Ginkgo Bioworks (NYSE:DNA) should only be reserved for the most daring of contrarians. As one of the riskiest growth stocks to buy, DNA is actually behind the eight-ball for two main reasons. First, it entered the public market via a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). As I’m sure you’re well aware, SPACs have greatly underperformed the benchmark equities index following their business combinations.

Another factor impeding upward mobility for DNA stock is that the underlying company is aspirational. While the core focus of the company — bioengineering for the production of bacteria with industrial applications — is intriguing, it’s also fiscally flawed. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2021, Ginkgo suffered a net loss of $1.6 billion against revenue of only $148.5 million.

Put another way, you’ve got to be in this for the long haul.

7 Retirement Stocks to Buy in May 2022

Still, DNA could be an enticing name among growth stocks if you intend on holding it for many years. Since the coronavirus pandemic, interest in advanced scientific and medical technologies has skyrocketed.

TeraWulf (WULF)

On the surface, TeraWulf (NASDAQ:WULF) sounds like an extraordinarily compelling concept. With the cryptocurrency market representing one of the biggest paradigm shifts in the entire investing ecosystem, it only makes sense that growth stocks catered to crypto-mining operations will enjoy at least the possibility of significant upside. Further, TeraWulf specializes in sustainable mining, distinguishing it from other miners. However, a closer inspection into TeraWulf reveals a highly speculative venture.

For one thing, the company appears to be a pre-revenue firm. According to its most recent Form 10-K disclosure, “TeraWulf expects to generate revenues” through its crypto-mining endeavors, which suggests that it’s not posting sales currently. As well, the underlying digital asset market has been tanking due to global recession fears, sending WULF into the abyss.

Is that reason enough to avoid WULF stock? For most folks, the answer is yes. However, if you’re on the adventurous side, you might note that the crypto sector has proven incredibly resilient. Over the long run, it’s unlikely that the blockchain will simply fade away. Therefore, if you’re willing to lose everything in the position, WULF could be intriguing.

The ship Glvois Splendor set off early on Wednesday from Shanghai with the Tesla cars and is headed for the Port of Koper in Slovenia, according to the Shanghai-based news outlet.

Tesla has also arranged 4,100 cars to be shipped on Friday, it said, adding that the automaker aims to export 300,000 cars from Shanghai in 2022.

""Tesla was in a big hurry to load cars freshly off the production lines onto the vessel yesterday afternoon,"" Shanghai Observer said, citing a customs official.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Tesla did not export any China-made Model 3s or Model Ys from the Shanghai plant in April, the China Passenger Car Association said on Tuesday, as China's zero-COVID-19 policies disrupted production and logistics.

The shipment marks further efforts to bring operations at Tesla's Shanghai plant, which makes Model 3 and Model Y for sale in China and for export to other markets, back to normal levels.

The factory's April 19 reopening was carried out with the help of the Shanghai governemnt and widely covered by Chinese state media. It was held up as an example of how the city is trying to keep business open while pursuing a tough COVID policy.

Telsa manufactured 10,757 cars at its Shanghai plant in April and had set a target to achieve a daily output of 2,600 vehicles a day from May 16, Reuters reported previously.

However, the goal is being challenged by supply and logistics issues as the plant ran well below capacity on Tuesday, showing the problems factories face trying to ramp up output under a tightening COVID-19 lockdown in the city.

Telsa manufactured 10,757 cars at its Shanghai plant in April and had set a target to achieve a daily output of 2,600 vehicles a day from May 16, Reuters reported previously.

However, the goal is being challenged by supply and logistics issues as the plant ran well below capacity on Tuesday, showing the problems factories face trying to ramp up output under a tightening COVID-19 lockdown in the city.

345,REFILE-Court says Musk recklessly tweeted that 'funding secured' for taking Tesla private,"(Fix typo in 9th sentence)

By Hyunjoo Jin

SAN FRANCISCO, May 10 (Reuters) - A court said that Elon Musk's 2018 tweets that funding was secured to take Tesla private was inaccurate and reckless, saying ""there was nothing concrete"" about financing from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund at that time.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco is a major victory for investors alleging that Musk inflated stock prices by making false and misleading statements, causing billions of damages.

In 2018, Musk met with representatives of the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and had a discussion about taking Tesla private, but evidence shows that ""there was nothing concrete about funding coming from the PIF,"" the judge wrote.

""Rather, discussions between Tesla and the PIF were clearly at the preliminary stage.

""No reasonable jury could find that Mr. Musk did not act recklessly given his clear knowledge of the discussions,"" he said.

He said details such as the total amount of funding needed to take Tesla private or the price to be paid for Tesla stock were not discussed.

The summary judgment, made on April 1, was sealed for more than a month before it was publicly available on Tuesday.

""It is hugely significant,"" shareholder attorney Nicholas Porritt, a partner at Levi & Korsinsky LLP told Reuters.

He said it is rare that class action plaintiffs get summary judgment on falsity and scienter before going to a jury trial, scheduled in January.

The remaining issue is what damages the intentionally false statement has caused to shareholders, he said.

The judge refused to grant shareholders summary judgment on the question of whether or not the allegedly false statements actually impacted Tesla's share prices.

Musk's lawyer, who has filed motions to undo the court decision, was not immediately available for comments. Musk said recently that funding was actually secured to take Tesla private in 2018.

The latest ruling was in line with a complaint from the U.S. security regulator which sued Musk for fraud charges for the tweets in 2018. He settled with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, stepping down as Tesla chairman, paying fines and agreeing to have a lawyer approve some of his tweets before posting them.

347,UPDATE 2-China vehicle sales plunge 48% but EVs strong as BYD gains,"(Updates with data, comment from industry groups, Musk)

SHANGHAI, May 11 (Reuters) - China's overall vehicle sales for April plunged almost 48% from a year earlier as COVID-19 lockdowns hit factories and showrooms, but sales of electric vehicles surged and Chinese brands took share from global rivals.

The monthly sales volume was the lowest for the month in a decade, underscoring the economic toll of the tough restrictions China put in place in April in Shanghai and other cities to control the spread of COVID.

The tally released on Wednesday by the China Association of Automobile Manufactuers (CAAM) includes sales to dealers of passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Retail sales of passenger cars alone dropped almost 36% in April, data released Tuesday by a separate trade group showed.

Overall, vehicle sales in the first four months of 2022 were down 12% from the same period a year earlier in the world's biggest car market, the CAAM said.

The bright spot remained sales of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, a fast-growing segment China has supported as ""new energy nehicles"", and where made-in-China brands now dominate. Sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids were up 45% in April and more than doubled over the first four months of the year from 2021 levels.

Among Chinese brands, BYD was the biggest winner, posting a 164% jump in sales in the first four months of the year, including April when its U.S. rival Tesla was hobbled by supply constraints.

BYD, which also makes EV batteries, accounted for 32% of all batteries installed in electric vehicles in April, trailing CATL , which accounted for 38%, data from the China Automotive and Battery Innovation Alliance showed.

Shares in BYD closed up 8.3%. Shares in CATL were up 8%.

Tesla's sales plunged 98% in April with exports down to zero, as Shanghai's lockdown disrupted logistics near its plant, data released Tuesday showed.

Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expected China's COVID restrictions to be less disruptive and that China sales would account for 25% to 30% of its overall sales in the long term.

""I had conversations with the Chinese government in recent days and it's clear that the lockdowns are being lifted rapidly,"" he said.

The CAAM and some private analysts said they also expected production and demand to begin to catch up in coming weeks for the losses in April, when dozens of cities were in full or partial lockdown.

Daiwa Capital Markets said in a note on Tuesday it expected major automakers would ""catch up in the coming months to make up for the sales loss in April"" with normal production levels in Shanghai this month.

348,Panasonic Considers US IPO for Blue Yonder Software Arm,"(Bloomberg) -- Panasonic Holdings Corp. said it plans a stock market listing for its supply-chain management arm, including the Blue Yonder business that it acquired for about $7 billion last year.

Panasonic, which also makes consumer electronics and batteries for Tesla Inc., sees the listing as an effective way to accelerate growth in the supply-chain unit, making it easier to recruit staff and make acquisitions. It’s also part of a broader push to increase the independence of its operating businesses, it said.

Panasonic bought full control of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based Blue Yonder last year after taking a minority stake in 2020, in one of the largest acquisitions by a Japanese company recently. Blue Yonder, founded in 1985, makes supply-chain management software and uses artificial intelligence to predict product demand.

In a press conference after the announcement, Panasonic Chief Executive Officer Yuki Kusumi said he would consider taking the division public outside of Japan, perhaps in the US. He said the timing of the deal is difficult to predict, especially given recent tumult in global markets.

“It’s hard to say now when we would be able to list the company because we just started mulling the idea,” he said. “But we hope to move as fast as we can because we’re aware speed is important. What units would be included into the new entity is one of many factors we will be considering.”

A market listing would also be a way to reward and retain employees at Blue Yonder, which had already filed for its own IPO when Panasonic swooped in with the acquisition. At the time of the deal, Blue Yonder had more than 3,000 customers, including Best Buy Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Walmart Inc.

Story continues

Panasonic announced the listing news after reporting earnings for the March quarter, including operating income that fell short of analyst estimates. It also forecast operating profit for the 2023 fiscal year that was shy of expectations.

CEO Kusumi said it’s unlikely the company would consider a similar spinoff for the battery business that supplies Tesla.

“We do not have any plans to list any other units of Panasonic, including the battery business,” he said.

While factories have been given special allowances to reopen under strict guidelines and systems, snarls in the supply chain -- from a shortage of delivery drivers to a lack of materials -- continue to disrupt local operators and global giants including Tesla Inc. and Sony Group Corp. And despite a decline in virus cases, the lockdown is intensifying as officials chase the elusive goal of wiping out Covid in the community.

“Restrictions on transport of people and goods remain a serious problem,” said Louis Kuijs, Asia Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. “Much more needs to happen before we can start talking about a return to normality.”

Under pressure from President Xi Jinping to insulate the economy from pandemic disruptions, the Shanghai government is painting a rosier picture, saying over 70% of 1,800 industrial companies had resumed production as of May 4. Within that number there are about 660 so-called key industrial firms, and more than 90% of those have restarted work, according to the authorities.

But manufacturers are far from firing on all cylinders. In a Shanghai Securities News survey of 667 companies, about half had resumed less than 30% of production as of May 7. The biggest challenges they face are disrupted supply chains and restrictions on staff movement, the newspaper said.

Another survey this month by the Shanghai Japanese Commerce and Industry Club found that almost two-thirds of Japanese-run factories in the financial and manufacturing center hadn’t resumed any production. None of the 54 companies surveyed had returned to planned levels of output.

Story continues

Many German firms are also finding it hard to get government permission to restart, according to Maximilian Butek, executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.

Closed Loop

China has touted “closed loops,” where workers are regularly tested and shuttled between factories and accommodation on-site or nearby, as a way to keep the economy running amid Covid Zero’s punishing diktats. But companies trying to operate these loops are facing issues from infections spreading among workers to lack of accommodation and social unrest.

Tensions flared last week at a facility that makes devices for Apple Inc., as workers rushed through barriers and clashed with guards trying to keep them inside, a video shared on Twitter and YouTube shows. The plant, owned by Taiwan’s Quanta Computer Inc., has been operating in a closed loop since the start of April.

3M Co., a Minnesota-based manufacturer of face masks, electronic components and other medical and industrial materials, found it hard to book hotels to accommodate workers returning to plants in Shanghai, the company’s China President Hongyu Ding said at a press briefing late last month.

Tesla shuttered its Shanghai plant for three weeks because of the lockdown in the city of about 25 million people. The factory, which typically would make around 2,100 cars a day, shipped only 1,512 vehicles out of Shanghai last month due to the impact on operations. Continuing logistics challenges may force production to cease again entirely later this week, a person familiar with the matter said, declining to be identified because the details are private.

While officials are eager to reassure that businesses are returning to normal, government data show manufacturing and services activity plunging to their worst levels since the pandemic began.

Even after securing permits to resume production, companies are struggling to get raw materials and parts due to difficulties in obtaining approvals to transport goods across provinces. Many truck drivers are also stuck in quarantine.

Sony Group Corp. on Tuesday cut its PlayStation 5 sales forecast to about 18 million units this fiscal year from a previous estimate of 22.6 million units, citing supply-chain complications due to the pandemic, including lockdowns in China. Nintendo Co. also said there had been some impact on sales because of the situation in Shanghai.

Supply-chain disruptions stemming from Chinese lockdowns have hit manufacturing in other countries. Toyota Motor Corp. said Tuesday it would suspend some production lines in Japan and lowered its global output plan for the month to 700,000 vehicles from 750,000 due to the lockdown in Shanghai. Mazda Motor Corp. suspended work at two factories in Japan twice last month due to a shortage of parts from China.

Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc., a Michigan-based manufacturer of car parts, had virtually no production at its Shanghai factories in April and its customers’ plants were also down, Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Edwards said in an earnings call last week.

“It’s far from over, in terms of getting back up to production levels in China that are normal,” Edwards said. “They had a great first quarter of it. With everything that’s happened now, that’s all out the window.”

351,Explainer-Can Elon Musk renegotiate a lower price for his Twitter deal?,"By Greg Roumeliotis

(Reuters) - Twitter Inc shares have plunged to their lowest level since the social media company agreed to sell itself to Elon Musk for $44 billion on April 25, raising questions over whether the world's richest person will try to renegotiate the deal.

On Tuesday, the implied probability of the deal closing at the agreed price fell below 50% for the first time, when Twitter shares dropped below $46.75. That is halfway between the deal price and the price of the shares before Musk revealed he had amassed a stake in the social media company on April 4.

The shares closed at $47.26, giving the company a market value of $36 billion.

News that Musk would lift a ban on former President Donald Trump's Twitter account, while significant politically, did not move the stock.

Twitter shares have plunged along with the wider collapse in technology stocks, as investors fretted over inflation and a possible economic slowdown. Some investors, such as short seller Hindenburg Research, have speculated about whether Musk would try to negotiate a lower deal price before closing.

Musk has not indicated he is planning to re-open negotiations and his representatives have declined to comment on the issue.

Here are answers to some key questions.

WHY WOULD MUSK WANT TO RENEGOTIATE THE DEAL?

Musk has an estimated net worth of almost $240 billion according to Forbes, yet most of his wealth is tied up in shares of Tesla Inc, the electric car maker he leads.

Musk has already moved to raise some cash to fund the acquisition of Twitter. He sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares and took out a $12.5 billion margin loan secured against his Tesla stock. Last week he reduced that margin loan to $6.25 billion after bringing in co-investors. Musk said in a regulatory filing he may seek more funding for the deal.

While Musk has said he does not care about the economics of buying Twitter, some investors think the 27% drop in Tesla shares since he revealed his stake is driven partly by concerns he may have to sell more shares. Therefore Tesla's stock would be under less pressure if Musk can negotiate a lower acquisition price. Some co-investors may egg him on if they become concerned about overpaying.

Story continues

HOW COULD MUSK NEGOTIATE A LOWER PRICE?

Musk can threaten to walk away from the deal unless Twitter's board agrees to reopen negotiations. He is contractually obligated to pay a $1 billion break-up fee, but Twitter would have to sue to get more than that in damages or try to force Musk to complete the deal.

There is plenty of precedent for a renegotiation. Several companies repriced agreed acquisitions when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020 and delivered a global economic shock.

In one instance, French retailer LVMH threatened to walk away from a deal with Tiffany & Co. The U.S. jewelry retailer agreed to lower the acquisition price by $425 million to $15.8 billion.

Simon Property Group Inc, the biggest U.S. mall operator, managed to cut its purchase price of a controlling stake in rival Taubman Centers Inc by 18% to $2.65 billion.

ARE THERE RISKS TO TRYING TO RENEGOTIATE?

There is no certainty that the strategy would work, and it could end up costing Musk more money.

First, Musk would have to convince Twitter he would really walk away. Then there are legal hurdles, including a ""specific performance"" clause that the social media company can cite for a judge to force Musk to complete the deal.

Acquirers who lose such a case are almost never forced to complete an acquisition, but target companies can seek monetary relief for the price of the abandoned deal.

Companies that have fought acquirers in court include medical technology firm Channel Medsystems Inc, which sued Boston Scientific Corp for trying to walk away from their $275 million deal. In 2019, a judge ruled the deal should be completed and Boston Scientific paid Channel Medsystems an undisclosed settlement.

Acquirers seeking an out sometimes turn to ""material adverse effect"" clauses in their merger agreement, arguing the target company has been significantly damaged. But the language in the Twitter deal agreement, as in many recent mergers, does not allow Musk to walk away because of a deteriorating business environment, such as a drop in demand for advertising or because Twitter's shares have plunged.

Musk also waived his right to carry out due diligence when he negotiated the Twitter deal, trying to get the company to accept his ""best and final"" offer. This makes it harder for him to argue in court that Twitter misled him.

The judge refused to grant shareholders summary judgment on whether or not the allegedly false statements impacted Tesla's share prices. The latest ruling was in line with a complaint from the U.S. SEC, which prosecuted Musk for fraud charges for the tweets in 2018 that followed Musk's exit as Tesla Chair, paying fines and agreeing to have a lawyer approve some of his tweets before posting them.

358,"I’m Sorry, But Mullen Automotive Makes Little Sense","In a business world dominated by toxic positivity, it’s dangerous for anyone to publicly criticize an investment, even one as flawed as electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN). Although it has noble aspirations — to deliver attractive, high-performance EVs armed with groundbreaking solid-state batteries (SSBs) — almost everyone has big dreams. It’s executing the vision that separates the viable from the also-rans, which is why you should steer clear of MULN stock.

Outside of its snazzy marketing literature, nothing really stands out to suggest that Mullen is a credible EV disrupter. InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth said it best when he compared the financial outlays that the company made relative to its peers. “Mullen spent just $3.1 million on research and development in 2021, just 2% of what QuantumScape (NYSE:QS), a leading developer of solid-state lithium batteries, spent. Yet, Mullen’s market capitalization is almost 6% of QuantumScape’s $5.06 billion valuation.”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Therefore, if you’re bullish on MULN stock, you’ve got to suspend disbelief and assume that with far fewer research and development dollars — and with arguably lower engineering acumen — that Mullen can nevertheless beat its far better capitalized and established rivals. Granted, it’s not an impossible circumstance, but I would consider it highly improbable.

7 Great Growth Stocks to Buy in May

But it’s not just about raw spending power — or lack thereof — that worries me about MULN stock. There’s the other component that advanced, potentially game-changing technologies like SSBs require time to finetune their nuances and complexities. For instance, recent research suggests that SSBs may not be necessarily safer than their conventional lithium-ion counterparts. Such findings, if proven legitimate, could negate one of the key benefits of SSB integration.

Story continues

Aside from this enormous challenge, Mullen would also have to overcome the unique struggles associated with the automotive supply chain disruption. Combined with inflationary pressures, the price of EVs have continued to swing higher and higher, far outside the reach of median-income households. Should Mullen be forced to compete in the premium space, it then faces the prospect of going up against heavy hitters like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID).

With so many question marks surrounding Mullen, it’s best to sit on the sidelines regarding MULN stock. It has little going right for it and way more things that can go wrong.

360,"Tesla (TSLA) Recalls 130K Cars, Halts Giga 3 Operations","Tesla Inc. TSLA has once again issued a new recall impacting nearly 130,000 vehicles. The recalled cars (consisting of 2021-2022 Model S and Model X, besides 2022 Model 3 and Model Y) were facing an overheating problem concerning the CPU of the center screen’s computer. The infotainment CPU may overheat during the preparation or process of fast-charging that causes the CPU to lag or restart.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has stated that an official recall is required since the glitch can affect critical functions when pre-conditioning the pack on the way to a Supercharger.

However, the fix is again an over-the-air (“OTA”) software update and does not need a physical recall. The OTA software update by Tesla will improve CPU temperature management free of charge. Owners are expected to be notified by Jul 1, 2022.

Of late, Tesla has had to issue a number of recalls, majorly due to software problems, but most of them were minor issues that could be fixed by simple OTA software updates.

In January this year, the auto giant issued a massive recall of 817,000 cars in the United States over an issue with the seat belt alert, likely caused by a software error. This recall impacted vehicles belonging to the 2021-2022 Model S and Model X, the 2017-2022 Model 3, and the 2020-2022 Model Y.

Although the company has to deal with the pain that recalls entail, it points to the high level of connectivity in its vehicles and the lack of dependency on third-party dealers to service them. It is one of Tesla’s biggest advantages over the rest of the industry.

In another blow, Tesla has been forced to halt most of its production at its Shanghai Giga 3 plant due to the ongoing shortage in plants needed for its electric vehicles, per media sources.

The plant intends to bring down capacity to lower than 200 vehicles on each day, far lesser than the almost 1,200 units it had been building each day since it reopened on Apr 19 after a 22-day production hiatus.

The re-imposition of lockdown in the event of a new breakout of coronavirus in Shanghai has further made it difficult for manufacturers to operate amid hard restrictions on the movement of people and materials. Aptiv, Tesla‘s main supplier of wire harnesses, stopped shipping from a Shanghai plant after a number of its workers were found infected.

It is not yet clear as to when the current supply challenges will be mitigated and the company can move back to its initial optimistic plans to bolster capacity at the plant.

Shares of TSLA have gained 35.7% over the past year against the industry’s 2.8% decline.

361,UPDATE 1-U.S. judge says Musk recklessly tweeted that 'funding secured' for taking Tesla private,"(Adds further comments by shareholder lawyer)

By Hyunjoo Jin

SAN FRANCISCO, May 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has determined that Elon Musk's 2018 tweets that funding had been secured to take electric car maker Tesla private was inaccurate and reckless, saying ""there was nothing concrete"" about financing from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund at that time.

San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Edward Chen's pre-trial decision represented a major victory for investors in a lawsuit accusing the world's richest person of inflating stock prices by making false and misleading statements, causing billions of dollars in damages.

Chen granted the shareholders summary judgment on the issue of whether Musk knowingly made false statements but declined to grant them summary judgment on the question of whether these statements actually impacted Tesla's share prices.

In 2018, Musk met with representatives of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and had a discussion about taking Tesla private, but evidence showed that ""there was nothing concrete about funding coming from the PIF,"" the judge wrote.

""Rather, discussions between Tesla and the PIF were clearly at the preliminary stage,"" Chen said.

""No reasonable jury could find that Mr. Musk did not act recklessly given his clear knowledge of the discussions,"" the judge added.

Chen said details such as the total amount of funding needed to take Tesla private or the price to be paid for Tesla stock were not discussed.

The summary judgment, made on April 1, was sealed for more than a month before it was made publicly available on Tuesday.

""It is hugely significant,"" shareholder attorney Nicholas Porritt, a partner at Levi & Korsinsky LLP told Reuters.

Porritt said it is rare that a judge decides that a defendant knowingly made false statements in summary judgment before a jury trial begins. The remaining issue is what damages the intentionally false statement has caused to shareholders, Porritt said.

Musk's lawyer, who has filed motions to undo the court decision, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk last month said that funding was actually secured to take Tesla private in 2018.

Chen's ruling was in line with a complaint from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The securities regulator in 2018 sued Musk for fraud relating to the tweets. Musk then settled with the SEC, stepping down as Tesla chairman, paying fines and agreeing to have a lawyer approve some of his tweets before posting them.

362,Tesla Urges Panasonic To Fast-Track Development Of Next-Gen Batteries,"Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) urged Panasonic Holdings Corporation (OTC: PCRFY) to speed up the development of its next-generation 4680 batteries, Bloomberg reports as per Panasonic CFO Hirokazu Umeda. Umeda disclosed ongoing robust demand for batteries at a post-results briefing, including the 2170 cells it supplies for Tesla’s electric vehicles. Umeda said, “We seeing continued strong demand from Tesla, for 2170 batteries, but also faster development of the 4680.” Panasonic CEO Yuki Kusumi looked to invest 600 billion yen ($4.6 billion) in automotive batteries, supply chain software, and other areas the company sees as core to its growth. Panasonic has been exploring sites in Oklahoma and Kansas for its multibillion-dollar factory to increase investment in EV cell production, and their proximity to the Tesla factory was critical for future growth. Panasonic looks to manufacture the bigger and more powerful 4680 batteries at its planned U.S. factory. Panasonic was betting on the newly-developed technology championed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the key to unlocking $25,000 EVs to open up doors to supply other automakers in addition to Tesla.

(21:45) - Knowing Your Risk Tolerance: What Fits Into Your Portfolio? (30:00) - Episode Roundup: FB, AMZN, NVDA, GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.com

Welcome to Episode #314 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.

Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.

This week, she went solo to talk about the FANGMAN stocks: Meta Platforms, Amazon, NVIDIA, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Netflix along with Tesla, which is also now a “sure thing” type stock. They are all down double digits in 2022. They are on sale.

But stocks are the one thing that when they’re on sale, people don’t want to buy them.

And while 2022’s sell-off has been painful for all investors, if you are a long-term investor in these stocks, the pain isn’t quite as bad. After all, Netflix is one of the best performing stocks of the last 10 years. But if you bought Netflix shares over the last year, then you are down big.

What should investors do about the FANGMAN stocks and Tesla, if anything?

Three Choices for Investors in 2022

1.       Sell your stocks and move to the sidelines with the cash.

2.       Do nothing.

3.       Buy more.

Tracey has no crystal ball to know if this is the bottom of this correction. Investors shouldn’t try and time the bottom. Have an investing strategy and stick to it.

But while the FANGMAN stocks are often lumped together, they are very different businesses with their own particular problems and issues in 2022.

Are These 5 Stocks on Sale?

1. Meta Platforms FB

Meta Platforms was the first of the FANGMAN  stocks to slide after it announced it would be spending a lot of money on the Metaverse and earnings growth would slow.

Story continues

Meta Platforms is down 41% year-to-date and now trades with a forward P/E of just 17.5. But, it also still has growth, as it has a PEG ratio of just 1.3.

Is Meta Platforms a deal now?

2. Amazon AMZN

Amazon shocked the Street in its first quarter report by talking about the slowdown in online consumer spending. Estimates have been slashed to just $10.85 for 2022 from $48.35.

As a result, Amazon shares have actually gotten more expensive, even though they’ve fallen 35%. It now has a forward P/E of 211 and a PEG ratio of 8.

Amazon is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) thanks to 9 analysts cutting estimates over the last 30 days. The Zacks Rank is a short-term recommendation, however.

How about for the long-term?

Is this a buying opportunity in Amazon or does it have further to fall?

3. Alphabet GOOGL

Alphabet hasn’t been immune to the selling pressures in 2022. Shares have fallen into a bear correction, losing 21% year-to-date.

Alphabet’s valuation has also fallen. It now trades with a forward P/E of 20.5 and a PEG ratio of just 1.1.

Earnings are holding up in 2022 and are expected to rise, but only 0.4%. But with these inflationary pressures, flat earnings growth this year is no small feat.

Is Alphabet the hidden gem among the FANGMAN stocks?

4. Microsoft MSFT

Microsoft is another FANGMAN stock which has entered into a bear correction, losing 20% year-to-date.

But Microsoft’s shares remain expensive, with a forward P/E of 29.5 and a PEG ratio of 2.3 as earnings are expected to grow another 16.9% this year.

Is Microsoft going to have to fall further for a bottom to be found in this correction?

5. Tesla TSLA

Tesla was one of the best performing stocks of 2020 and 2021. But Tesla shares are down 25% in 2022 and are only up 17% over the last year.

It’s not cheap, even with the sell-off, with a forward P/E of 77 and a PEG ratio of 2.6.

But Tesla is still growing quickly. 2022 earnings are expected to grow 66% to $11.26 from $6.78 last year.

Is this a golden opportunity to get into Tesla?

365,3 Electric Vehicle Stocks to Buy,"Electric vehicle stocks have been getting crushed, but represent opportunity if the market turns around. Tesla (TSLA) — The leader in electric vehicles with strong momentum despite market-wide turmoil. Ford (F) — Electrifying the country’s best-selling vehicle, while investing in its long-term EV goals. Nio (NIO) — a strong electric vehicle producer in China that has seen its stock fall 80%. a bush cut out in the shape of a car with a plug attached to it and a charger symbol in the center implying it's an electric vehicle

At one point, electric vehicle stocks were some of the hottest names on Wall Street. While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) had always been a popular name, many others joined the fray. Some of these companies were traditional automakers, while others were newer EV companies that were already public. Lastly, we had a large number of new EV entrants in the market.

Now that this group has taken a painful beating, there could be some opportunity to pick over the scraps. Maybe not tomorrow and perhaps not next week. But these are names to keep on your radar this year.

At one point, I complained about the new entrants. Some debuted via IPOs, while others came to market via SPAC offerings. It doesn’t matter though. The point is, too many companies were entering the market and generating egregious valuations with little to no revenue.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

It was completely undeserving. And while that alone may not be enough of a reason to dislike a stock (or a whole group of them), it was certainly a concern. Think about it. How could Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) be worth $100 billion — and more than Ford (NYSE:F) — without any real revenue?

That never made sense, but there were several dozen other examples. Let’s look at a few electric vehicle stocks that do have merit.

Tesla is one of the top-tier electric vehicle stocks in the market. The recent swoons in the stock price have less to do with its business and more to do with outside noise. Specifically, CEO Elon Musk’s agreement to buy Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) caused new concern for the stock price.

Story continues

Because of his $44 billion purchase, he has had to start raising cash by selling some of his holdings in Tesla stock. Musk has brought in a few other buyers, which may stem some of the concern for how much he’ll sell, but now we also have a market-wide selloff to navigate.

7 Great Growth Stocks to Buy in May

Even though Tesla has been doing well and still commands an $860 billion market cap, it’s hard to believe its stock won’t go down if the market continues to sell off.

That said, the company most recently beat on earnings and revenue estimates. It also delivered better-than-expected delivery results and just opened two new production plants. This one is a winner.

Ford (F) 2022 Ford (F stock) F-150 Lightning Lariat

Ford is a really interesting one here, especially now that we can consider it one of the electric vehicle stocks. When it comes to profit and sales, this is one of the more stable automakers in the EV space.

The company possesses the F-Series pickup truck, which is the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. Notice I didn’t say the best-selling truck — it’s the most popular vehicle in the country. Now Ford’s rolling out an electrified version with the F-150 Lightning.

The truck will start at just under $40,000 and offer 230 miles of driving range. Longer ranges will be available for customers looking for a larger battery. Any concerns Ford had about potential demand has evaporated over the last year. In Q4, the company stopped taking reservations as they topped 200,000.

The automaker continues to increase its production plans and most recently announced it will double production to 150,000 units annually by 2023.

The F-150 is part of a trifecta approach from Ford, which has its Mustang Mach-E and electric Transit van in its EV plans as well.

Lastly there’s Nio (NYSE:NIO), which is one of the more controversial names on this list of electric vehicle stocks. That’s as the stock has been liquified, falling 80% from its all-time high.

If we’re talking about ranges, this one has been all over the map. From its post-Covid low in March 2020, Nio stock soared more than 2,900%. Yeah, almost 3,000% in less than a year! Anyone that was able to jump on board and hold for a bulk of the move can probably retire now. That is, if they sold.

4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for May 2022

The rally was stunning, but the decline has been just as jaw-dropping. The question now is, can it find its footing?

Despite the seeming distrust of Chinese equities and the disgust toward growth stocks, Nio continues to do good things. The automaker recently set a quarterly record for deliveries, while analysts still expect strong growth. Specifically, consensus expectations call for 73% revenue growth this year and 66% growth in 2023.

Keep in mind, there have been recent delisting fears with Nio stock. So investors will need to weigh that consideration for their own risk tolerance.

366,Ford F-150 Lightning: What it’s like to drive the all-electric truck,"Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reviews his road test of Ford's latest all-electric pickup truck and the consumer incentives to purchase a full-utility EV.

Video Transcript

- What things changed? Will they stay the same? America's best selling truck for more than 40 years running is now electric. Unfortunately for you, Ford had stopped taking orders for the 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning due to demand. While the rest of us will have to wait till next year, Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian did not have to wait to drive this baby. He's joining us now to talk about it.

Now, I'm curious because Ford F-150 owners, which I know a lot of, they don't really care how it goes on the highway. They care how this thing tows and how it drives off road. So that's what I want to hear about first, if you don't mind.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So yeah, we had the opportunity to drive both on road, off road and tows as well in a two-day test that I had. And let me start with the on road impressions where I thought the truck actually surprised me when I thought it was like, am I in the normal F-150? Very smooth power delivery, quiet.

I think that's on purpose. That's on design. They want you to feel like you're actually in a normal F-150, but it's quieter. It's very smooth and very powerful. So on road, it was great.

But I was really impressed with the off road, Brett-- I mean, Dave, I'm sorry.

[LAUGHTER]

- I get.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, it breaks. So it breaks. So off road, it was amazing in terms of just the sheer ability to have instant torque right off the bat on rocks, on loose terrain. You can lock the differential in the back. And it can just basically get you out of anything.

So in my opinion, it was super impressive from that point of view because of the fact that it's no slip. There's no whining. And the transmission kind of struggling. It's just straight power immediately.

And, of course, towing-- you mentioned towing. I had a $5,000 pound trailer in the back. You couldn't really feel it. It like you're just driving normally. Now, your range comes down by about half, right? But that's, I guess-- Ford said that's what happens when you normally drive a truck with a big payload or trailer in the back too.

Story continues

- Now, obviously, this looks huge. So in terms of sort of the bells and whistles, the interior, what are we looking at in terms of like cool features inside?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, they did a really good job of keeping that interior sort of very welcoming and presentable to what most owners would have expect. But they actually added a couple of electrified elements like the big vertical tablet screen in the front that you've seen the Ford Mach-E.

You can basically control everything with that-- your climate control, your radio, infotainment, everything, navigation. And it's very informative too because it's got that big screen, very clear legibility. And also the fact that you can actually type in where you want to go, and it'll tell you where to actually charge up when you need to.

- Pras, so it sounds like you're a fan of this. I think initially when it was laid out there from Ford, lot of people were questioning whether they would want to buy or people would want to buy an electrified F-150. It sounds like you think it's a huge hit.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, from my point of view, I think it's a big win for Ford. They really had some things-- some key things in mind that they wanted to hit capability, utility, power, and also fun, right? I mean, it's not just a truck that you take to the worksite, also to the campsite, and to maybe a tailgate.

And I think they really succeeded at that. Because Rivian is their big competition, and they're more of an adventure, fun, go anywhere kind of truck. This is actually a truck that you can actually power your home in, power a worksite, power a campsite. So I think they really kind of hit it out of the park making a truck that's so-- has so much utility but also can be used for that fun offering that we all want to do.

- And unlike Rivian, that does appear you can get one at some point. But when can you get this new truck? They've stopped taking orders for this year's model. Will you be able to get one this time next year?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: If you're lucky. Now--

- If you're lucky.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --they're making them right now in Dearborn. You can actually-- you know, if you go to a lot, you might find most of them are spoken for. They might have some of that trickle out to the lots that you can actually buy at retail, if you're lucky. But for the most part, you're not going to get your hands on one until like maybe 2023.

- Wow.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I don't think.

- You have to be willing to wait. But, hey, there's long lines to wait for any new car out there right now.

- Yeah, sure.

- So we'll see. All right, Pras Subramanian, thanks so much.",2022-05-11T19:49:38+00:00

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

- Welcome back. EV truck and cargo van maker Rivian in desperate need of a charge, following news over the weekend that Ford sold eight million shares after its stock lockup expired, shedding 20% off the share price for Rivian. But the stock is getting a boost on earnings. News, joining me now is Garrett Nelson, CFRA vice president and equity analyst, good to see you, Garrett. What do you make of the earnings? Tell us about it.

GARRETT NELSON: Sure, thanks for having me. The bottom line was a little bit better than expected here. Came in at adjusted EPS loss of $1.43. The consensus was a loss of $1.66, and it looks like the beat was due to lower than expected cost, because revenue came in a little light. The revenue was only 95 million for the quarter, the consensus was about $129 million. They are maintaining their vehicle production guidance for the full year of 25,000 vehicles. So we think that's a positive that they're not lowering the guidance, due to a lot of the supply chain issues and chip shortages, which continue to plague the auto industry. But overall, it's a decent release. The stock is getting a little bit of a bounce, but I think you have to put it in context. The stock is down about 80% year to date. And so it's a small victory, I think, if you're long.

- Yeah, when you're down 80% year to date, it's a very low bar. They have leapt over it, and up about 8% in after hours. The original projection was for more than double that amount of vehicles, though, right? This is down from the original 50?

GARRETT NELSON: Yeah, it's well below where I think a lot of analysts' estimates were heading into this year. So it's certainly a very difficult environment for automotive companies, still. Especially if you're a startup, like Rivian is.

Story continues

- They have talked a lot about supply chain issues. How much have they plagued the company, and why more so than Tesla?

GARRETT NELSON: Yeah, I mean, when you're a new company like Rivian, you just don't have the experience. And a lot of the long standing relationships that a company like Tesla has formed over the years, you know Tesla, essentially, in their 16th year, 17th year of operation, Rivian just produced its first vehicle last fall. And so they're especially exposed to these supply chain issues, and I think that's a big reason why the stock is down so much. It's a market that's really been very unforgiving to unprofitable high growth names, such as Rivian.

- We mentioned the Ford sell-off of the eight million shares, now they're still one of the major share holders in Rivian. Do you expect further sales? Amazon's the one that everyone is eyeing, really dragged down their quarter.

GARRETT NELSON: We do. So Ford, even after selling the eight million shares, they still have about 94 million shares that they own, which gives them about a 10 and 1/2% ownership stake in Rivian. You mentioned Amazon, we think that's really one to watch here because, Rivian, as it stood at the end of the quarter, had about $15 billion of net cash. And the stock has sold off so much that its market cap is now approaching its net cash on the balance sheet.

And so we think that a company like Amazon, Amazon owns almost 18% of the company, it might make sense, in terms of an acquisition. Or for a traditional automaker, looking to make a bolt on acquisition to really gain some EV exposure. So the stock is sort of interesting at these levels after this huge sell off.

- When you look at the space early in the program, we talked a lot about the Ford F-150 Lightning. Pras Subramanian actually test drove this thing. They have sold out, stopped orders for 22. How does that impact them in this space that Ford is not only producing this pickup, but they are selling out of it?

GARRETT NELSON: Yeah, so Rivian brought the first electric pickup truck to market when they made first deliveries of the R1T last fall. Now, the Ford has started production of the f-150 Lightning. They have reservations for over 200,000 units for that vehicle, so we think that's why Ford, which had a partnership with Rivian, that they backed out of about six months ago. And we think that's why they're selling some of their ownership in the company, is because now, they really view them as a direct competitor in the threat in the electric pickup space.

- Yeah, and Ford came out and virtually lapped them. R.J. Scaringe, the CEO there, is once the next Elon Musk. He talked a lot about the battery capacity, how there's only 10% of what is needed out there. What do you expect to hear from him in the call, and how does he reassure investors?

GARRETT NELSON: Yeah, in our view, there's only one Elon Musk, and Tesla really has established a first mover advantage in battery technology in electric vehicles. It's why they're the dominant player in the space. And so we don't hold R.J. Scaringe to the same-- hold him in the same esteem as someone like Elon Musk. But it's just really years of experience that why Tesla is our top pick in this space, why we have a strong buy on the stock. We think Rivian, and essentially all other vehicle manufacturers, are well behind Tesla in terms of battery technology and overall electric vehicle quality. And so I think we remain very positive on Tesla for that reason.

- So bottom line, are you buying Rivian at this point?

GARRETT NELSON: We have a hold on the stock right now.

- If you're out there, if you're a retail investor.

GARRETT NELSON: I think it gets interesting at these levels with the sell-off. Because as I mentioned, the net cash on the balance sheet is at a level that's approaching the market cap of the stock. And so I think at that point, there is some value. You'd see how in Amazon, or maybe another automaker could see value here in Rivian, so we do think it's a little more interesting here in the low 20s.

- Amazon currently owns 17.7% of the shares in Rivian. Thank you for joining us, Garrett Nelson, CFRA vice president and equity analyst.",2022-05-11T21:10:53+00:00

The Federal Reserve is facing a tall order. It needs to get runaway inflation under control without bringing the economy grinding to a halt. Fed chair Jerome Powell made a major step toward trying to achieve these goals on Wednesday, when he announced the Fed’s 50 basis points interest rate hike. In his press conference, Powell said that the Fed is working “expeditiously” to bring inflation under control.

For a moment, it seemed that Powell had struck just the right tone with these comments. The S&P 500 leapt 3% on Wednesday, marking one of its best days of the past year. After a month of relentlessly sinking stock prices, there was hope. But then, the market immediately gave back those gains Thursday and Friday. Still, while the market remains uncertain, the recent price action around the Fed decision shows that the market is ready to make a serious upward move if and when the Fed can get inflation to a more manageable place.

7 Growth Stocks to Buy on the Dip

In other words, if the Fed can really make the adjustments necessary to get inflation in check, the stock market could be set for a major rally. For investors with confidence that the economy still has better days ahead of it, these seven stocks should lead the way in the months ahead.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM)

You can’t have a healthy economy and stock market without a solid financial system. Bank credit is the oxygen that keeps the economic fire alive. And JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), as one of the country’s largest and best-run investment and commercial banks, is a key barometer of overall economic health.

With JPM stock down nearly 25% year-to-date, it’s clear that investors are not liking what they’re seeing at the moment. However, the bank’s actual results have been strong. JPMorgan’s Q1 results were laudable in most regards. Yes, the headline earnings number missed as the bank builds reserves for potential future credit losses. However, actual operating results and metrics such as net interest earned continue to improve.

If the economy surprises to the upside and the bulls take charge again, JPM stock at 11x earnings and a 3.3% dividend yield is quite the offer. Shares are now down close to 10% since the beginning of 2020. It’s hard to believe that JPM stock is worth less now than it was prior to the onset of Covid-19, but that’s where things stand today. Once the current bout of pessimism lifts, JPM stock should enjoy a swift rebound.

KB Home (KBH)

One of the major turning points for the market last week came during Powell’s Q&A session. In it, a journalist asked Powell if the Fed would be open to an aggressive 75 basis point rate hike in future meetings. Powell unequivocally shot that idea down, saying the Fed’s future rate hikes would be more measured.

This was the best news possible for the housing market, and homebuilders like KB Home (NYSE:KBH) in particular. Investors seemed to have this sinking sense of dread that the Fed was going to raise rates so aggressively as to send the economy straight into a recession. However, the Fed seems willing to chart a moderate path ahead.

7 Biotech Stocks With Key Catalysts for May

After dropping by a third over the past year, KBH stock is now — get this — trading at less than 4x forward earnings. Analysts project more than $10 per share of earnings for KB Home this year, yet the stock is selling for just $33 per share. It seems investors are reliving their nightmares from 2008 when the housing market collapsed. However, the market is structurally far healthier today than in that crisis. People will look back at sub-4x price-to-earnings ratios in 2022 for homebuilders with shock. Unless the economy rolls over tomorrow, KBH stock is way too cheap.

Visa (V)

Visa (NYSE:V) is, more or less, a small tax on global commerce. Visa takes a fractional piece of millions of transactions every day in almost every country on earth. As economic activity picks up globally, Visa profits. It’s particularly tied to international travel, as it gets to charge much higher transaction fees on purchases made in a foreign currency.

The limits to international travel really hurt Visa’s growth over the past two years. However, the company should be able to post strong numbers in 2022 as the global economic reopening continues to advance. Visa reported strong quarterly earnings in Q1 of this year; that was a welcome surprise as many large-cap companies have been putting up disappointing numbers as of late. V stock should work its way back toward 52-week highs once the market downturn lets up.

Polaris (PII)

Polaris (NYSE:PII) is a leading maker of snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). This is a fairly cyclical business. Demand for these sorts of vehicles is highly dependent on economic conditions and also — for snowmobiles — the amount of snowfall in a given winter.

These sorts of cyclical stocks can make for great investment opportunities during a bull market. Not surprisingly, PII stock has slumped lately as traders rush to get out of the way of a potential recession.

7 Great Growth Stocks to Buy in May

The fact is, however, that PII stock is already back down to pre-Covid levels. Meanwhile, the business is less cyclical than people might fear. It has grown revenues every year sequentially dating back to 2017. Meanwhile, sales only increased 17% in 2021, this isn’t a business that experienced a sudden windfall due to pandemic-related buying patterns. PII stock is at just 10 times forward earnings and should be set for a sharp rally as consumer spending remains robust this coming year.

Ford (F)

The automakers have become true battleground stocks. For one, there’s the always lurking threat of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other electric vehicle (EV) makers in terms of disrupting the existing order. For another, the global semiconductor shortage has made life exceptionally difficult for the major manufacturers such as Ford (NYSE:F).

It’s a glass half full situation, however. The supply chain shortages have hurt as badly as they have precisely because demand is so high. If Ford can get the parts it needs, it should be able to produce record profits in the current economic environment. And if the Fed is able to manage a soft landing, pent-up consumer demand should keep car sales elevated for the next few years. With F stock down 35% year-to-date, shares are now going for less than 8 times earnings. That’s a bargain if you’re bullish on the economy.

Airbnb (ABNB)

Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) shows the dangers of being viewed as a tech stock in the current environment. At its core, Airbnb is a leisure and hospitality company and is heavily driven by macroeconomic factors such as demand for international travel, airfare prices, levels of Covid-19 restrictions and the like.

And yet, because Airbnb uses a technology platform to offer its services, it ends up trading as though it were just another software-as-a-service (SaaS) company. Lately, that’s nothing but bad news for a stock’s prospects.

7 Biotech Stocks With Key Catalysts for May

To put numbers on that, Airbnb just announced an incredible quarter with 70% revenue growth and 59% nights and experiences booked growth. A decent chunk of that is due to reopening from the pandemic, to be sure. However, Airbnb has already surpassed pre-Covid levels of activity in terms of both user numbers and profitability. In a better market for tech stocks, ABNB shares would be surging right now. Instead, they’re down more than 15% after their latest earnings call. That’s a mispricing, and an opportunity for growth investors today.

Zoom Video (ZM)

Finally, it’s worth rounding out the list with a pure growth stock. If the bull market is still alive and well, some of these beaten-down software companies will stage tremendous recoveries. Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) seems like one of the survivors in this current growth shakeout.

For one thing, Zoom is highly profitable. ZM stock is trading at 27 times forward earnings. Yes, that’s earnings, not revenues or EBITDA or other such metrics. On an earnings basis, Zoom is now selling at the same valuation ratio as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).

Now sure, Coke is a more stable business long-term. However, there isn’t much growth in soft drinks anymore. By contrast, analysts still see Zoom being able to grow revenues at a double-digit rate for at least the next few years.

27 times earnings isn’t a bad price at all for Zoom if it is able to manage its transition from a stay-at-home superstar to a more stable large tech enterprise. ZM stock has been absolutely pummeled over the past year as top-line growth slowed. But it has a large user base and strong profitability metrics to shelter it from the current market storm.

375,Scrutiny of Elon Musk’s Twitter Moves Intensifies in Washington,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter Inc. is facing more scrutiny in Washington following a report that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is probing whether he broke rules last month when disclosing a large stake in the social media platform.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the SEC is investigating Musk’s submission of a form that investors must file when they accumulate more than 5% of a company. The Federal Trade Commission is also reviewing the bid by the world’s richest person to take Twitter private.

Musk disclosed on April 4 that he acquired more than 9% in the company, a week later than regulations allow and by using a filing typically reserved for passive investors. He has since embarked on a highly-public takeover bid.

An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the Journal report. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Inquiries by the SEC don’t always lead to the regulator taking action.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been pressing to tighten rules for how investors must disclose they’ve taken a major stake in a company. He’s called for more transparency, and earlier this year proposed cutting the maximum time that an investor has to reveal they’d taken a significant position.

Over the years the SEC has repeatedly sparred with the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and was already investigating whether he and his brother violated insider trading rules when selling shares in the electric automaker late last year -- something Musk has denied. He’s also fighting the regulator in court over fallout from his infamous tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private.

Musk, who reached an agreement to acquire Twitter for roughly $44 billion late last month, has said the San Francisco-based company has restricted user speech and wants to push it toward a more free-speech approach.

376,Assisted driving systems struggle with collision tests - study,"By Joseph White

DETROIT, May 12 (Reuters) - Assisted driving systems installed in Tesla Inc, Hyundai Motor Co and Subaru Corp vehicles failed to avoid head-on collisions in testing done by AAA, though Tesla's Autopilot system did slow the vehicle to a walking speed before striking an oncoming, foam model of a car.

The AAA, a U.S. consumer and travel services organization, said the tests illustrate how current assisted driving and automated braking systems fall short of true autonomous driving, and require drivers to stay in control of vehicles.

A fast-growing number of new vehicles are equipped with Automated Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS, that partially automate functions such as steering, staying in a lane and braking. Tesla's Autopilot is one of the best-known such systems, but most major automakers offer similar technology. Regulators, auto insurers and automakers warn that ADAS systems cannot safely substitute for a human driver's full attention.

In their latest study of the limitations of assisted driving technology, researchers for AAA set up four scenarios for the three tested models: Overtaking a dummy car traveling in the same direction as the tested vehicle; overtaking a dummy cyclist heading in the same direction; confronting a dummy car on a head-on collision course at 25 miles per hour; and avoiding a dummy bicycle rider crossing the test car's path.

All three tested vehicles detected and avoided hitting the dummy vehicles and cyclists traveling in the same direction, ahead of the tested vehicles, AAA said.

But the Hyundai Santa Fe and Subaru Forester did not appear to detect or slow to avoid colliding with the foam dummy vehicle during a simulated head-on collision, AAA said.

The Model 3 did automatically hit its brakes when it detected the oncoming dummy car, slowing to 3.2 miles per hour or slower before colliding with the dummy car.

Tesla did not reply with comments on the study. Hyundai said in a statement it ""is reviewing the findings in AAA's report as part of our ongoing commitment to customer safety.""

Subaru is looking into the AAA test to understand the methodology and does not have a detailed response at this time, spokesman Dominick Infante said in an email. The automaker has improved its EyeSight assisted driving system for the 2022 model year Forester, he added.

AAA said a Subaru Forester it tested failed to detect a simulated bicycle rider crossing its path in five test runs. A Tesla Model 3 and a Hyundai Santa Fe did see and brake for a dummy cyclist crossing their paths. (Reporting By Joe White Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2022-05-12T04:01:00+00:00
377,"Crypto Rout, PPI, SEC Probing Musk - What's Moving Markets","By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- The world's most important stablecoin, Tether, wobbles as the rout in crypto deepens. The U.S. producer price index for April is due, a day after another unsettling report for consumer inflation. Stocks are set to extend their losses into a sixth day, and even solid gains in streaming can't help Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). The SEC is probing Elon Musk's late disclosures in his bid for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and oil is down amid the general decline in risk assets. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 12th May.

1. Tether wobbles as crypto rout deepens

The world's biggest stablecoin fell below its notional peg of 1:1 against the dollar on Thursday as the global selloff in cryptocurrencies deepened.

Tether dipped as low as 93.35 cents in early trading in Europe - over 6.5% below its peg - but recovered most of its losses after Tether's chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino said in an interview broadcast on Twitter that the majority of Tether's reserves are now held in risk-free U.S. Treasuries. He said that the Tether network was meeting redemption demand “without a sweat drop.”

Redemption demand is surging as crypto investors head for the exits after the collapse of assets linked to TerraUSD, a stablecoin that was backed largely by Bitcoin and algorithmic trading. Bitcoin fell over 12% to its lowest since December 2020, while Ethereum fell over 22%. The only beneficiary of the move was USD Coin, a stablecoin which, like Tether, is backed by dollar reserves.

2. PPI, Jobless Claims due

The latest act in the U.S. inflation drama is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with the release of producer price inflation for April. Analysts expect factory gate prices to have risen by only 0.5%, a slowdown from 1.4% in March. That should take the annual PPI down to 10.7% from 11.2%.

The figures come a day after the monthly consumer price inflation report showed a mixed picture, with strong increases in demand for travel and further solid rises in food and shelter prices, but with declines in prices for the kind of goods – especially used cars – that were so in demand a year ago.

Story continues

At the same time, the Labor Department will also release the week’s jobless claims numbers. Initial claims are expected to hover just below the 200,000 level, despite a surprisingly strong uptick last week.

3. Stocks set to extend losses; Disney down despite streaming gains

U.S. stocks are set to extend their losses at the open, unable to shake fears about a growth slowdown as central banks around the world act to tackle runaway inflation (except in China, where the growth slowdown is the result of a real estate crisis and heavy-handed pandemic management).

By 6:15 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were down 207 points, or 0.7%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.2%.

Stocks likely to be in focus include Walt Disney, which is set to open down nearly 5% at a two-year low in response to weaker-than-expected earnings after the bell on Wednesday. That’s despite the fact that its Disney+ streaming network – under much scrutiny in the wake of Netflix’s shock subscriber decline in the first quarter – added nearly 8 million new subscribers, well above expectations.

Any disappointment at the Mouse House should pale in comparison with Softbank (TYO:9984), which reported a $13 billion loss for the fiscal year just ended, due to massive writedowns on some of its holdings such as ride-hailing company Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI), Singaporean peer Grab (NASDAQ:GRAB) and food delivery company DoorDash (NYSE:DASH). Softbank stock lost 8% in Tokyo overnight.

4. SEC probes Musk’s Twitter disclosures - WSJ

The Securities and Exchanges Commission is investigating Elon Musk’s late disclosure of his stake in Twitter, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter late on Wednesday.

Musk disclosed the scale of his buying 10 days later than SEC rules would allow. That let him buy more stock without alerting others to the fact.

The news is unlikely to help smooth Musk’s planned acquisition of the social media platform, given its already-contentious political dimension. Further declines in the value of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which Musk intended to pledge as collateral for part of his buyout loan, are also complicating the process. Twitter stock is set to open at $45.26, the lowest it has been since Musk made his offer to take the company private at $54.20 a share.

5. Oil down but IEA warns of continued tightness in fuel markets

Crude oil prices fell on Wednesday, unable to escape the global growth fears weighing on risk assets around the world.

By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude prices were down 1.6% at $104.02 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 1.5% at $105.87 a barrel.

In a monthly report on the state of the oil market published earlier, the International Energy Agency kept its forecasts for global supply and demand roughly stable but warned that global fuel markets may face further strain in the months ahead as Chinese demand rebounds following a spate of new COVID lockdowns.

378,Ukrainian fighter trapped in Mariupol steel plant asks Elon Musk for help,"KYIV, May 12 (Reuters) - One of the fighters holed up in a steelworks besieged by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol has appealed to SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk to help evacuate them.

Many civilians were rescued from the sprawling Azovstal plant last week under an agreement with Russia, but no deal has been reached with Moscow on allowing out hundreds of fighters, some of whom are wounded, after weeks of bombardment.

""@elonmusk people say you come from another planet to teach people to believe in the impossible. Our planets are next to each other, as I live where it is nearly impossible to survive,"" marine commander Serhiy Volina wrote on Twitter.

""Help us get out of Azovstal to a mediating country. If not you, then who? Give me a hint.""

Musk, the world's richest man, owns rocket company SpaceX and electric car maker Tesla, and is planning to buy Twitter. It was not immediately clear whether Musk had seen Volina's tweet.

Ukrainian officials say there are about 1,000 fighters holding out in Azovstal's many underground tunnels, hundreds of whom are seriously wounded and in need of urgent evacuation. The plant is under heavy Russian fire.

In February, when Ukraine's internet was disrupted following Russia's invasion, Musk responded to a tweet by a Ukrainian government official seeking help. Musk said SpaceX's Starlink satellite broadband service was available in Ukraine and that SpaceX was sending more terminals to the country.

Volkswagen previously expected to match its profit margins from combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicle sales in two to three years, but the carmaker was in a robust financial position, Diess said, despite a challenging economic environment.

""We expect that the e-mobility business will be as profitable as the combustion engine business earlier than planned,"" Diess said. ""Through good crisis management, we are financially robust and have strengthened our resilience.""

Diess intends for Volkswagen to overtake Tesla and become the world's number-one electric carmaker by 2025, building on its bigger product offering covering luxury and premium cars as well as volume brands.

Volkswagen delivered some 452,000 battery-electric vehicles globally last year and aims for half of its global output to be all-electric by 2030.

382,"Get ready for more repeats and less drama, says BBC chief","Tim Davie enjoyed a £75,000 pay rise in September BBC Licence fee - Hannah McKay - WPA Pool/Getty Images

The BBC's Director General has warned that the BBC has ""some choices to make"" after raising the spectre of more repeats of shows and less original programming.

Tim Davie suggested that the corporation will be forced to cut back on what it makes after the government announced the licence fee will remain at £159 for two years amid the cost-of-living crisis.

Speaking at the Deloitte and Enders Media and Telecoms conference, Mr Davie said: ""We have some choices to make. I think we will still be able to offer a great service.""

He added that the ""stakes are very high about what kind of society we live in"" over discussions about the BBC's future funding model.

He said: 'Listen to the public. What are we? Storytellers, a democracy.""

It suggests the director general is preparing for cuts to programming and follows a similar warning last month.

In April, he told the Voice of the Listener and Viewer conference: ""We make 31 dramas a year, we'll probably have to make less.

'What I'm not willing to do is compromise on quality. You may end up with services like BBC Four, which are great but primarily archive services.""

'Are they repeats? Yes. Are they of value? Yes. We'll still have thousands of hours of origination, but I would rather do less and protect quality.'

The BBC has been required to cut its spending by £1bn a year between 2017 and 2022 owing to the licence fee settlement imposed in 2015 by Chancellor George Osborne. It recently scrapped concessions for over-75s because of budgetary concerns.

Despite this pressure, it announced this week that staff would get their largest pay rise for a decade, with an increase of 4.24pc for most employees in August that will later be supplemented with a further 1pc raise.

Mr Davie said the corporation ""can go further"" on cuts. The BBC has so far focused on cost reductions on administrative staff rather than programming and newsroom employees.

Story continues

He said: ""We will always been hunting for costs and we will keep hunting.""

In January, the Government announced the BBC's licence fee would be frozen as ministers ""move to support families in the face of rising living costs"".

Ms Dorries recently suggested the Government could axe the BBC licence fee altogether and replace it with a new funding model. It is thought that the fee will rise slightly after 2024 for three years before it is abolished completely.

Ms Dorries said: ""This licence fee announcement will be the last. The days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors are over. Time now to discuss and debate new ways of funding, supporting and selling great British content.""

Mr Davie has warned the latest licence fee settlement will leave a £285m gap in funding.

The BBC's latest pay rise will not apply to senior leaders including Mr Davie, whose wages are assessed through a different process which awarded him an increase of £75,000 in September, up 15pc to £525,000.

The BBC said the pay rise for its workers was a ""fair deal to licence fee payers and to staff"" and was possible after the corporation cut staff numbers by 1,200.

Mr Davie hit back at suggestions that the BBC should be more like American streaming giants such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney+, and emphasised that the BBC's programmes must remain relevant to people living outside London.

He said: ""Our biggest challenge is 'Are we relevant?' We want to be relevant.

""We're not trying to be Netflix, we're trying to be the BBC...We need to listen to the public. What are we? Storytellers, a democracy.""

""We've just got to focus where we are most distinctive, it's as simple as that.""

The BBC has also been contending with the loss of a series of its most high-profile presenters. Breakfast host Dan Walker recently left for Channel 5, while Andrew Marr, Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel have also departed, as well as veteran broadcaster and interviewer Andrew Neil.",2022-05-12T11:21:23+00:00
383,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Tesla, BRP Group, and Dorman Products","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – May 12, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla Inc. TSLA, BRP Group, Inc. DOOO, and Dorman Products DORM.

Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:

Tesla (TSLA) Recalls 130K Cars, Halts Giga 3 Operations

Tesla Inc. has once again issued a new recall impacting nearly 130,000 vehicles. The recalled cars (consisting of 2021-2022 Model S and Model X, besides 2022 Model 3 and Model Y) were facing an overheating problem concerning the CPU of the center screen's computer. The infotainment CPU may overheat during the preparation or process of fast-charging that causes the CPU to lag or restart.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has stated that an official recall is required since the glitch can affect critical functions when pre-conditioning the pack on the way to a Supercharger.

However, the fix is again an over-the-air (""OTA"") software update and does not need a physical recall. The OTA software update by Tesla will improve CPU temperature management free of charge. Owners are expected to be notified by Jul 1, 2022.

Of late, Tesla has had to issue a number of recalls, majorly due to software problems, but most of them were minor issues that could be fixed by simple OTA software updates.

In January this year, the auto giant issued a massive recall of 817,000 cars in the United States over an issue with the seat belt alert, likely caused by a software error. This recall impacted vehicles belonging to the 2021-2022 Model S and Model X, the 2017-2022 Model 3, and the 2020-2022 Model Y.

Although the company has to deal with the pain that recalls entail, it points to the high level of connectivity in its vehicles and the lack of dependency on third-party dealers to service them. It is one of Tesla's biggest advantages over the rest of the industry.

Story continues

In another blow, Tesla has been forced to halt most of its production at its Shanghai Giga 3 plant due to the ongoing shortage in plants needed for its electric vehicles, per media sources.

The plant intends to bring down capacity to lower than 200 vehicles on each day, far lesser than the almost 1,200 units it had been building each day since it reopened on Apr 19 after a 22-day production hiatus.

The re-imposition of lockdown in the event of a new breakout of coronavirus in Shanghai has further made it difficult for manufacturers to operate amid hard restrictions on the movement of people and materials. Aptiv, Tesla's main supplier of wire harnesses, stopped shipping from a Shanghai plant after a number of its workers were found infected.

It is not yet clear as to when the current supply challenges will be mitigated and the company can move back to its initial optimistic plans to bolster capacity at the plant.

Shares of TSLA have gained 35.7% over the past year against the industry's 2.8% decline.

FANGMAN Stocks & Tesla: Sell or Buy More?

Welcome to Episode #314 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.

(0:30) - Navigating High Flying Stocks During A Market Self Off (5:25) - Are The FANGMAN Stocks Becoming Value Stocks? (21:45) - Knowing Your Risk Tolerance: What Fits Into Your Portfolio? (30:00) - Episode Roundup: FB, AMZN, NVDA, GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.com

Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.

This week, she went solo to talk about the FANGMAN stocks: Meta Platforms, Amazon, NVIDIA, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Netflix along with Tesla, which is also now a ""sure thing"" type stock. They are all down double digits in 2022. They are on sale.

But stocks are the one thing that when they're on sale, people don't want to buy them.

And while 2022's sell-off has been painful for all investors, if you are a long-term investor in these stocks, the pain isn't quite as bad. After all, Netflix is one of the best performing stocks of the last 10 years. But if you bought Netflix shares over the last year, then you are down big.

What should investors do about the FANGMAN stocks and Tesla, if anything?

Three Choices for Investors in 2022

1.       Sell your stocks and move to the sidelines with the cash.

2.       Do nothing.

3.       Buy more.

Tracey has no crystal ball to know if this is the bottom of this correction. Investors shouldn't try and time the bottom. Have an investing strategy and stick to it.

Story continues

But while the FANGMAN stocks are often lumped together, they are very different businesses with their own particular problems and issues in 2022.

Are These 5 Stocks on Sale?

1.       Meta Platforms FB

Meta Platforms was the first of the FANGMAN  stocks to slide after it announced it would be spending a lot of money on the Metaverse and earnings growth would slow.

Meta Platforms is down 41% year-to-date and now trades with a forward P/E of just 17.5. But, it also still has growth, as it has a PEG ratio of just 1.3.

Is Meta Platforms a deal now?

2.       Amazon AMZN

Amazon shocked the Street in its first quarter report by talking about the slowdown in online consumer spending. Estimates have been slashed to just $10.85 for 2022 from $48.35.

As a result, Amazon shares have actually gotten more expensive, even though they've fallen 35%. It now has a forward P/E of 211 and a PEG ratio of 8.

Amazon is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) thanks to 9 analysts cutting estimates over the last 30 days. The Zacks Rank is a short-term recommendation, however.

How about for the long-term?

Is this a buying opportunity in Amazon or does it have further to fall?

3.       Alphabet GOOGL

Alphabet hasn't been immune to the selling pressures in 2022. Shares have fallen into a bear correction, losing 21% year-to-date.

Alphabet's valuation has also fallen. It now trades with a forward P/E of 20.5 and a PEG ratio of just 1.1.

Earnings are holding up in 2022 and are expected to rise, but only 0.4%. But with these inflationary pressures, flat earnings growth this year is no small feat.

Is Alphabet the hidden gem among the FANGMAN stocks?

4.       Microsoft MSFT

Microsoft is another FANGMAN stock which has entered into a bear correction, losing 20% year-to-date.

But Microsoft's shares remain expensive, with a forward P/E of 29.5 and a PEG ratio of 2.3 as earnings are expected to grow another 16.9% this year.

Is Microsoft going to have to fall further for a bottom to be found in this correction?

5.       Tesla TSLA

Tesla was one of the best performing stocks of 2020 and 2021. But Tesla shares are down 25% in 2022 and are only up 17% over the last year.

It's not cheap, even with the sell-off, with a forward P/E of 77 and a PEG ratio of 2.6.

But Tesla is still growing quickly. 2022 earnings are expected to grow 66% to $11.26 from $6.78 last year.

Is this a golden opportunity to get into Tesla?

What Else do you Need to Know About the FANGMAN Stocks and Tesla?

Even though the automobile sector suffered the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and a worldwide semiconductor shortage, data from Statista showed that 63.8 million cars were sold in 2020, and this figure went up to 66.7 million units in 2021. While some regions were hit hard by the pandemic, particularly South America and Europe where automotive sales dropped by one-fourths year over year in 2020, other regions such as China saw a recovery in car sales by 2021 where the figure had quadrupled as compared to 2020 numbers. As we move into 2022 and break free from the shackles of COVID-19, the automotive industry is undergoing a series of ground-breaking transformations as part of the EV revolution and from advancements in IoT technology to make cars ""smart"".

Global Automotive Industry Analysis

The global automotive manufacturing market was valued at $2.7 trillion in 2021 and is projected to reach $2.8 trillion in 2022. According to a market report published by Research and Markets, the global automotive market consisted of 85.32 million units in 2020 and is projected to hit 122.83 million units by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3.71% over the forecasted period. Primary drivers for this growth are an influx in consumer demand, hefty investments being poured into R&D, government initiatives and incentives for the electrification of vehicles, and technological innovations that are being integrated into vehicles to boost consumer interest.

389,"Column: Bitcoin, NFTs, SPACs, meme stocks — all those pandemic investment darlings are crashing","Pedestrians pass a GameStop store in New York in 2021. The company was a leading meme stock in 2021, but its shares have come down to Earth. (Associated Press)

The finance world, which is constantly on the lookout for rules and laws it can break in the interest of making more money, may have come up against the one law that can't be broken: the law of gravity.

Over the last few weeks and months, almost every financial asset has come hurtling back to Earth after high-altitude flights.

That includes conventional stocks and bonds, which have spent most of 2022 in the red. But fad assets such as cryptocurrencies, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), blank-check companies (or SPACs), and meme stocks such as GameStop, have taken the biggest hits.

The unicorns are being gelded, reins pulled in, their horns knocked off with a croquet mallet....Realism is rapidly setting in.

Joshua M. Brown

So too have ""story stocks"" — those that trade more on popular expectations or grand conjecture than traditional financial analysis.

They include shares in companies that rose by providing goods or services that experienced high demand during the pandemic — exercise bike maker Peloton, for instance, down a sweat-inducing 93% from its peak of $171.09 in January 2021, and teleconference firm Zoom Video Communications, down 85% from its peak of $588.84 in October 2020.

Then there's electric-car maker Tesla, perhaps the most prominent story stock in the market today. Tesla shares trade largely on followers' faith in the wisdom of its chief executive, Elon Musk. In Wednesday's trading the shares fell $66 to $734, a decline of 41% from their peak of $1,243.49, reached Nov. 4.

Tesla's price shock could have any of several reasons, as I wrote last month. Among them is concern about Musk's dalliance with a new plaything, namely Twitter, which he is proposing to buy in part by borrowing against his Tesla shares in a way that could force him to sell some stock if the price continues to fall. (Bloomberg estimated that point at $740, meaning that a margin call may already have been sounded.)

Or the market may finally have recognized that Tesla shares were overpriced in relation to its actual financial prospects.

Story continues

Put it all together, and investors large and small may have the feeling that they have nowhere to hide.

As Joshua M. Brown of Ritholtz Wealth Management puts it on his blog The Reformed Broker, ""The unicorns are being gelded, reins pulled in, their horns knocked off with a croquet mallet.... Realism is rapidly setting in.""

He observes that the buzzwords of just a year ago — ""boundless growth, total addressable market, venture-backed, innovative, groundbreaking, web3, transformational, disruptive"" — are no longer being uttered with a straight face.

Some of the carnage reflects factors in the overall markets. Investment risks are rising in tandem with rising interest rates, which produce head winds for corporate sales and higher thresholds for corporate profitability.

Financial regulators such as central banks and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are moving to tighten rules on investments that seemed at first to fall outside their jurisdiction, such as cryptocurrencies and SPACs. With social distancing practices easing, investors who once played the markets out of boredom may be turning back to other modes of entertainment.

In the broad market, the declines may simply be part of a natural cycle in which excessive enthusiasm is periodically counterbalanced by gloominess.

The downdraft has reduced some of the stars of the recent fads nearly to persona-non-grata status. One is investment manager Cathie Wood, whose ARK Investment Management was the quintessential vehicle for stakes in new-economy companies. The ARK Innovation exchange traded fund, through which retail investors could piggyback on Wood's picks, peaked at $132.50 on June 30. Wednesday's closing price was $36.93.

Since so many of these novel investments were pitched as countercyclical alternatives to conventional stocks and bonds — that they'd save investors from a bear market — it's proper to examine how they've failed to fulfill that promise.

Let's examine some of them one by one.

Meme stocks

In early 2021, a handful of stocks in failing companies suddenly acquired new life. Movie theater company AMC Entertainment, which had been trading in the low single digits, reached $72.62 on June 2. GameStop, a money-losing mall-based video game retailer that had traded as low as $2.57 in April 2020, hit $483 on Jan. 28, 2021.

GameStop became the emblematic ""meme stock,"" meaning that it was pumped up by online stock pickers with a story to tell. The central yarn was related to the notion that short sellers, who borrow shares with the intention of selling them and eventually buying them back at a lower price to return to the lenders, are an illegitimate drag on the stock market.

GameStop had been a favorite of the shorts because its bricks-and-mortar business model seemed to leave it with nowhere to go but down.

The meme story held that short sellers were chiefly rich hedge funds vulnerable to a “short squeeze,” in which a stock is driven up, forcing the shorts to buy back in at a higher price, which puts them in the red. That meant that buying into GameStop was a way for the little guy to put it to the Man.

Another point was that GameStop had come under the control of Ryan Cohen, a visionary investor who was going to lead the company into a new-technology nirvana.

None of these claims has panned out. GameStop is still losing money — more in the latest quarter, which ended Jan. 31, $147.5 million, than in any others that followed Cohen's arrival.

On Jan. 25, I looked at the price of GameStop shares and conjectured that the fad was over. GameStop had closed at $100.15 the day before. On Wednesday, as I type these words onto my screen, the shares closed at $81.33, down more than 13% on the day.

That doesn't mean GameStop might not still show some life. At the end of March it spurted back up to $165, before resuming its glide path down. That could happen again. But the available retail investment capital to power a sustained move ahead appears to be waning.

That's because all the meme stocks that rode the popular wave during the pandemic have taken major hits. The index of 37 meme stocks compiled by Bloomberg has reached a record low in the last few days, down 63% from its peak in January 2021.

The army of do-it-yourself small investors who stormed into the market early in 2021, when it seemed to be the only entertainment venue still open, have been ushered to the woodshed. That's according to Morgan Stanley, which calculates that all the gains made by day-traders since the start of 2020 have now been extinguished.

Their experience is much worse than that of buy-and-hold investors who stayed in Standard & Poor's 500 stocks during that period — despite its recent swoon, the S&P 500 index is still up by about 21.5% since Jan. 1, 2020.

As for another player in the meme stock game, the zero-commission broker Robinhood Markets, through which many meme investors placed their orders, its price action points to the ebbing of the craze. Robinhood peaked at $85 on Aug. 4, shortly after its initial public offering. Wednesday it fell to $8.15.

Cryptocurrencies

These currencies based on computer algorithms and blockchain technology, which is a way of maintaining data records ostensibly outside the control of central banks and other such institutions, are perennially said to be ""moving into the mainstream"" of investment and finance.

That trend is almost entirely an illusion. In part that's because no one has made a sustainable, consistent utility case for crypto — that is, no one has a good answer for the question: ""What's this for?""

Renaming the downtown Los Angeles NBA and NHL playing venue ""Crypto.com Arena"" doesn't make crypto legitimate; it's an advertising ploy by a crypto marketing firm.

Nor does the willingness of Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs — they're mostly responding to demands from their wealthy clients to provide them with a way to get in on crypto while it's still a craze and (they hope) get out ahead of the inevitable crash. The firms are happy to do so and collect fees in the meantime.

The wealthy can afford to take a flier. Not so the average household. As John Reed Stark, former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission's office of internet enforcement, warned in a recent interview with Vice, ""It's their financial future, their kids’ future, their family's future, their house.""

Fidelity Investments' idea of allowing people to put bitcoin into their 401(k) retirement accounts has been rightly assailed by the Labor Department, where an official called it the product of ""a lot of hype.""

“For the average American, the need for retirement savings in their old age is significant,” Ali Khawar, whose division oversees retirement plans, told the Wall Street Journal. “We are not talking about millionaires and billionaires that have a ton of other assets to draw down.”

It's always dangerous to mistake marketing for value. For instance, anyone who invested $1,000 in a bitcoin fund — let's say the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF — on Oct. 28, when Crypto.com premiered its ""Fortune Favors the Brave"" commercial starring Matt Damon, today would have $468. (Thanks to Jon Schwartz of the Intercept for this useful metric.)

NFTs, SPACs, etc.

Almost every investment idea that seems to make no sense will eventually crash, sometimes falling faster than they rose.

Non-fungible tokens, which are digital representations that are pitched as unique and therefore have the virtue of scarcity, are a good example. NFTs confer no ownership to anything but the digital file, which may be an image of an object that is actually owned by someone else. Someone has parodied the NFT market by purporting to sell NFTs of images of individual Olive Garden restaurants, but it’s the kind of parody that gets at the essential truth of the target.

The NFT market soared on a wave of overheated claims that it would remake the market for creative objects and bring riches to starving musicians and artists. In January, TV host Jimmy Fallon and celebutante Paris Hilton jointly hyped their NFTs on Fallon's ""The Tonight Show."" The market has now crashed.

An NFT of the first tweet posted by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey (it read: “just setting up my twttr"") was sold to a Malaysian business executive for $2.9 million in March 2021. The owner put it up for sale last month, hoping to collect $50 million. The highest bid was less than $14,000.

Investors are also running away from blank check companies known as special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. The heyday for these shell companies, which aimed to raise money, typically by the hundreds of millions, for pools that promised only to merge with another as-yet unidentified company sometime in the near future, seems to have passed. At its peak, it attracted figures such as Donald Trump, which may have led some investors to question its soundness.

Last year the number of SPACs completing deals with target companies nearly tripled over the previous year to 613 and the amount raised in those deals nearly doubled to $162.5 billion, according to the market service SPAC Research. So far this year, only 66 deals have been closed, for a meager $11.5 billion.

Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and other banks are pulling out of the SPAC market or scaling down, Bloomberg has reported. Among the reasons are tightened regulations issued by the SEC, which saw SPACs as tools to circumvent disclosure rules applicable to conventional initial public offerings. Investment market conditions discouraging for IPOs also weigh on SPACs.

The lesson of all these declines becomes clearer with every passing day. Wall Street banks will pump up any investment idea if they think it can feed a demand, no matter how short-lived. But when the fun's over, the music stops, the merry-go-round grinds to a halt — choose your own metaphor — the people left empty-handed are those who could least afford to play in the first place.

Stark, in his interview with Vice, spoke like a man who has seen all this before, and not once but many times.

""It's one big giant get-rich-quick scheme,"" he said of the universe of novel investment devices. ""But the bottom line is, people are investing because they think there'll be some greater fool to pay more than they paid.""

Cathie Wood of ARK Investment Management has seen her growth-heavy portfolio steadily lose billions in value over the past few months as interest rates rise and batter risky stocks. The portfolio value of her equity holdings has dropped from $33 billion at the end of December 2021 to around $23 billion at the beginning of the second quarter of 2022. During the period, Wood made new purchases in 38 stocks, sold out of 46 firms, made additional purchases in 140 equities, and reduced holdings in 167 stocks.

Some of the top stocks in the ARK portfolio at the end of the first quarter of 2022 included Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX). Despite the beating that ARK Investment Management has taken, Wood has doubled down on her growth bets. At a recent appearance on a webinar, Wood attacked the central bank for being “too aggressive” with a hike in interest rates, noting that the global economy had already gone into a recession, with stock market volatility a sign of investor panic in this regard.

Wood highlighted that there were a lot of indicators of a looming bear market, with investors trying to short innovative firms a prime example. Wood claims that these shorts will be forced to cover their positions. The flagship ARK Innovation ETF of Wood, one of the biggest winners of 2020, is down more than 57% this year. Compared to the highs it touched in February 2021, the fund is down over 70%. Despite the losses, Wood continues to attract investor interest, with her fund drawing over $455 million in net inflows in the first week of May.

Cathie Wood Doubled Her Stakes in These Stocks in 2022

10. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 96

Percentage Increase in Stake During Q1: 80%

Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides payments services. The firm posted earnings for the first quarter of 2022 on May 5, reporting earnings per share of $0.18, missing market estimates by $0.02. The revenue over the period was $3.9 billion, down over 21% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and missing analyst expectations by $180 million. In the first three months of 2022, the Cash App of the company generated $2.46 billion of revenue and $624 million of gross profit.

On May 6, Truist analyst Andrew Jeffrey maintained a Buy rating on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stock and lowered the price target to $165 from $220, noting the firm was approaching a period of higher investment to expand beyond the current market.

At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 96 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5.9 billion in Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), compared to 98 in the preceding quarter worth $8.8 billion.

Just like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is one of the growth stocks on the radar of hedge funds.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Farrer Wealth Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) (formerly Square): We ‘adopted’ Block’s stock after the company bought Afterpay, which we were investors in. We had been trimming the Afterpay position throughout 2021 and trimmed again after the acquisition, so the position was quite small. We held onto that small portion, as we did think the acquisition made sense and were excited to see the two companies integrate and for Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) to create a closed loop network between merchants and consumers. However, the market punished most highly valued tech stocks over the last months, and we saw the position move against us by over 50%. We are firm believers that when a stock goes against you by 50%+, you need to do something about it. Either trim/sell and reinvest or buy more. In the case of Block, the original reason for holding was to see how the acquisition and integration with Afterpay panned out. The market did not give us the time to see this play out, thus we were not comfortable adding more to the position. Further for the stock to recover to our purchase price, we felt the company’s valuation would need to command a future exit multiple that the market would be unlikely to pay in this environment. Given this, we exited the remainder of the position.”

Stocks were down big Wednesday and GameStop (NYSE:GME) followed suit as GME stock retreated by 13% with sky-high inflation and increasingly at-risk consumers a theme being played across financial newsfeeds.

An ugly 2022 for much of Wall Street just got a good deal uglier yesterday. April’s consumer price index (CPI) data revealed a stronger-than-forecast jump of 8.3% and reaffirming that most of life’s essential and non-essential goods are keeping inflation afloat near four decade highs.

The report took its toll on the broader averages with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down roughly 1.50% to 3.0% and hitting new year-to-date lows. And larger losses of around 5% to 8% in market leaders Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) made agreeable sense to investors as well.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But before you point fingers at fearful and deafening macro developments driving others on Wall Street crazy, it’s simply time to acknowledge, avoid or even short a GME stock whose siren song has lost its voice.

Ticker Company Current Price GME GameStop $81.33

GME Stock Is Still King, Without a Court

Inflation. Rising interest rates. Poor fundamentals. When some investors discuss GameStop’s opportunity to move forward, those items invariably are a big piece of the conversation. And it’s usually a message that’s negative.

I can’t fault the caution or outright bearishness. That seems especially true given a fledgling brick-and-mortar retail gaming business that’s past its prime and attempting to pivot into something more 21st century featuring a larger digital presence, crypto, non-fungible assets (NFTs) and, who knows, maybe even an angle in the metaverse? Apparently.

So, yeah, Wednesday’s CPI data obviously has a place in any dialogue regarding GME stock.

But it would be reckless to ignore the impact other chatter known as “mentions” or lack thereof, in the investment forum of Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets. It’s that activity among a subset of aggressively bullish traders known as apes that made GME stock a household name over the past year.

GME stock mentions are still a thing and GameStop remains the king of memes played by Redditors. But it certainly doesn’t hold court like it did.

On Wednesday in fact, CPI mentions of around 1,000 took top honors on WallStreetBets. By comparison, GME stock was in sixth place with about 180 remarks and roughly 1% of what the real “Gamestonk!!” Siren song remains mostly about.

GME Stock Bottom Is a Bluff GameStop (GME) is challenging its March low, but don't expect a double bottom to hold in today's market environment

Source: Charts by TradingView

Not only are the wildly frisky days of tweets being retweeted and tweeted again as mentions responsible for GME stock’s legendary short squeezes largely over, but those infamous diamond hands have been replaced by a 2-7 off suit in no position to bluff.

Technically, GME stock could be tempting some traders into buying shares as it challenges its March low. It’s a classic scenario which could play out as a bullish double bottom pattern. But don’t expect GameStop’s short interest of 20% to blink, let alone run for cover.

Not only does a weak-looking stochastics warn that buying GME stock and profiting from the pattern is a longshot, but there’s no price confirmation. On the provided weekly chart that would require an impressive bounce in its own right of nearly 50%!

But even on the daily time frame, buying a volatile double bottom (if the pattern receives technical confirmation) requires too much faith in a meme stock movement that has seen its heyday and one further challenged by today’s risk-off environment.

GameStop Takeaway

So if buying GameStop has the deck stacked against it, a short should make sense, right? It does. And with shares still commanding a $7.5 billion market cap and GME more than four-fold higher than 2021’s low, there’s room to play it bearishly alongside GameStop’s short interest.

Appreciably, shorting GME shares remains a riskier proposition given its day-to-day volatility or the possibility of a muted short squeeze. But an out-of-the-money bear put spread can help with those types of challenges.

A vertical of this kind limits and vastly reduces unwanted upside exposure if GameStop rallies. Conversely, the strategy can generate outsized profits compared to an equivalent short stock position if GME trades lower.

As with anything, there’s compromises. Among other things, with this sort of strategy returns aren’t maximized until expiration. And in the interim when trying to capture profits or further minimize contained losses, GME’s volatility can make that sort of disadvantage look more significant.

But ultimately, a bear put spread’s pros far outweigh the cons in trading GameStop more smartly than shorting shares.

Video Transcript

- We're not even 90 minutes into the trading session, and it's a wacky one, folks. It's a kooky one. I don't know how else to describe it. It's a weird one, right? So the NASDAQ composite is now up 3/4 of 1%. And we've been looking at all the trending top stocks here. We've got Walt Disney that is still lower, but not by much-- not even 1%. Apple is still down about 1%.

But then you have Beyond Meat, which has turned higher by some 5% here. You've got Rivian that is now up by 21%. And then I was looking at the heat maps, and I believe earlier, Mr. Sazi, you were talking about Coinbase that was still lower in the day. But guess what? Now it's higher. So there's obviously some unusual reversals going on today that don't seem to be driven by certainly any particular news.

- Yeah. What caught me initially by surprise was just the broad based nature of this rally, Julie. So I've got a good quick note from Dennis to butcher over a 22 research longtime Wall Street markets veteran. He's telling me the reason-- what triggered this reversal, at least from what he's hearing. The PPI index, which you talked about this morning, up over 11% in the headline. But that core PPI was weaker than expected. So again, that is setting off some views, perhaps, that maybe the Fed doesn't move too fast on rates. Unsure, but that is part of the mood in the market. And to me, it makes sense, because we are seeing broad based moves. It's not like one stock is reversing and that's cast positive sentiment on the entire market.

- I mean, look at some of the areas that we do have making a pretty swift reversal right now. You've got tech, Tesla, Amazon. And yeah, sure, I'm going to talk about Tesla as a tech stock, because when you've got a computer on wheels, as they are, that's what is looked at, as well as the cult fanfare that it has around it. But that up 2.8%. It's fallen precipitously on their entire road to this Twitter acquisition because of the annexation to Elon Musk, of course. But that being up 2.7% here on the day.

You could also loop that into some of the meme or at least social media stocks, the ones that get discussed the most, at least online. And talking about social media stocks, as we're taking a look at the meme stocks here. Robinhood even up 6.4% right now too with that move almost in concert that we were looking at a moment ago in Coinbase too.

- This is my emoji for this move today. I mean, all respect to Dennis, I don't know that this has a super fundamental basis, but I guess maybe as the session goes on we'll-- maybe we'll get some clarity. We shall see.

That does it for us today. Coming up, Akiko Fujita and Brian Cheung are going to speak to FTX US President Brett Harrison. That should be fascinating, given the move that we have been seeing in crypto here this morning and over the past several days. We will be back here tomorrow morning.",2022-05-12T15:09:26+00:00

404,"UPDATE 1-Renault says split-off electric unit could employ 10,000 staff by 2023","(adds detail, background)

PARIS, May 12 (Reuters) - French carmaker Renault on Thursday said the two business units that would result from its planned separation of electric and conventional car production could each employ 10,000 staff by 2023.

Renault said in a statement it was currently studying the option of creating two separate entities to manage a major shift towards fossil-free vehicles and would present progress of these studies at a capital market day in the autumn.

""The aim of these strategic reflections is to adapt each technology, drawing on the group's strengths and expertise on its various markets and within the Alliance"", Renault said.

Renault reiterated that jobs dealing with EV production would be bundled inside France, while it's workforce for conventional cars will be located abroad.

Sources earlier this year told Reuters that Renault's Chief Executive Luca de Meo wanted to press ahead with plans to split up the group despite potentially costly uncertainty over its interests in Russia.

Playing catch-up with rivals like Tesla and Volkswagen, the French automaker first outlined its strategy shift in February.

Several working groups are actively working on the creation of two separate legal structures, code-named ""Ampere"" for the electric and ""Horse"" for the thermal and hybrid assets, two of the three sources said. (Reporting by Tassilo Hummel; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",2022-05-12T16:19:22+00:00
405,UPDATE 1-Musk looks to scrap Tesla margin loan with new Twitter funding - Bloomberg Law,"(Adds details from report, background)

May 12 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is in talks to raise enough equity and preferred financing for his proposed buyout of Twitter Inc to negate the need for a $6.25 billion margin loan linked to his Tesla Inc shares, Bloomberg Law reported on Thursday.

The billionaire's advisers, led by Morgan Stanley, have begun soliciting interest from potential investors for as much as $6 billion in preferred equity financing, the report https://news.bloomberglaw.com/mergers-and-acquisitions/musk-seeks-to-scrap-tesla-margin-loan-with-new-twitter-funding?context=search&index=0 said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Twitter declined to comment on the report, while Musk could not be reached for comment.

Musk originally took out a $12.5 billion margin loan secured against his Tesla stock to help fund his purchase of Twitter. But he reduced that loan to $6.25 billion earlier this month after bringing in co-investors.

406,Tesla stock hits 8-month low as Shanghai Gigafactory adds drag,"Tesla's (TSLA) stock briefly dipped below the $700 level on Thursday, touching an 8-month low, amid an overall market rout and concerns of production stalls at the electric vehicle's Shanghai plant.

Shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker have been under pressure recently after a Reuters report of a temporary production halt for some vehicles at the company's gigafactory in China because of problems securing parts.

The plant had already gone through delays of about three weeks in April due to Covid lockdowns in Shanghai.

The stock has also been under pressure after Bitcoin (BTC-USD) sharply declined this week. Tesla bought some of the cryptocurrency to hold on its balance sheet last year.

The EV maker is down 38% year-to-date, while the Nasdaq Composite (^iXIC) is down about 27%.

The markets have been selling off since the Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in a move to tame inflation.

Electric vehicle stocks have gotten clobbered during the recent sell-off. Rivian (RIVN) is down 75% year-to-date. On Thursday the EV startup's stock jumped 18% following its quarterly results. Shares were trading above $23 each, a far cry from their all-time high of $179 in November of last year.

Lucid (LCID), XPeng (XPEV) and NIO (NIO) are down more than 50% year-to-date.

That was halved to $6.25 billion after he disclosed $7.1 billion in equity commitments from investors including Larry Ellison, Sequoia Capital, Qatar Holding and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, with the latter rolling his Twitter stock into the deal.

Since then, Musk has received commitments for another $1 billion in equity, and is in talks for more, one of the people said.

That additional equity, on top of the preferred financing, would be enough to erase the margin loan, cutting the risk of the deal for both Musk and his lenders.

It would also alleviate pressure on Tesla’s stock, which is the cornerstone of Musk’s $216 billion fortune, the world’s largest. The electric carmaker has tumbled more than 25% since he agreed to purchase Twitter, stoking concerns among investors that he may sell even more than the $8.5 billion he’s already disposed of to fund the buyout.

Talking Terms

The preferred equity may have a 20-year maturity and include a feature allowing interest to be paid in kind at a rate of 14%, the people said. That interest rate would be increased by 75 basis points in the seventh, eight and ninth year, they added. The financing may alternatively be structured with a 10% interest rate and warrants, one of the people said.

Story continues

Terms and size of the financing aren’t finalized and could change. Musk can block any transfers of the preferred equity, some of the people said.

A representative for Musk did not respond to requests for comment. A Morgan Stanley representative declined to comment.

Firms including Apollo Global Management Inc. and Sixth Street are already discussing participating in the preferred financing, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

Investors, especially those who specialize in merger arbitrage, have been hyper-focused on Musk’s margin loan since he made his offer for Twitter. That’s because as of June 30, Tesla’s chief executive had already pledged more than half of his shares toward other borrowings, leaving him with a limited amount he could put up for the social-media company and raising the risk that a slide in the stock could jeopardize the buyout.

At the initial $12.5 billion size and after his share sales last month, Musk wouldn’t have had enough unpledged Tesla shares to cover the margin loan if the stock fell below $837. At the current $6.25 billion, Musk could withstand a drop to about $420.

Tesla fell to as low as $680 on Thursday, and traded at $735.61 at 12:33 p.m. in New York. Twitter, meanwhile, surged as much as 3% intraday, before paring its advance. At $45.40, it remains below Musk’s $54.20 offer.

408,"Twitter to Freeze Hiring, Rescind Offers Ahead of Musk Deal","(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal announced a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting efforts on Thursday, a reflection of the company’s state of uncertainty while it awaits Elon Musk’s $44 billion takeover.

Twitter won’t hire new employees and may rescind offers already out, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg. Some exceptions will be made for business-critical roles, as determined by Twitter leadership. The company is also pulling back on costs such as travel, consulting and marketing, according to the memo.

Agrawal said global events, including the war in Ukraine and the supply chain crunch, have hurt Twitter’s business results and may continue to do so. The company isn’t planning company-wide job cuts, “but leaders will continue making changes to their organizations to improve efficiencies as needed,” Agrawal wrote.

“At the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, the decision was made to invest aggressively to deliver big growth in audience and revenue, and as a company we did not hit intermediate milestones that enable confidence in these goals,” Agrawal said. “In order to responsibly manage the organization as we sharpen our roadmaps and our work, we need to continue to be intentional about our teams, hiring and costs.”

Two of Twitter’s top leaders are also departing. Kayvon Beykpour, head of consumer product, and Bruce Falck, in charge of revenue, are both leaving the company. Jay Sullivan will take over as head of product and interim head of revenue. Sullivan has talked about re-focusing the company on fewer projects during recent team- and company-wide meetings, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Story continues

Beykpour said on Twitter that it’s not how he imagined leaving the company. “Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction,” he said.

A Twitter spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment. As Musk doesn’t yet own Twitter, he is not yet directly influencing the company’s decision-making. Larger competitor Meta Platforms Inc. also recently said it will reduce planned expenditures.

The changes reflect Twitter’s current state of limbo while it awaits a new owner. Musk, the world’s richest man and CEO of Tesla Inc., agreed to buy the company for $44 billion last month, but the deal may not be finalized for months, as Musk is still working to secure the financing. On Tuesday he suggested that the deal could still fall apart.

That has left Twitter employees in a lurch, as many don’t know whether the projects or teams they are working on will be prioritized under new leadership.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

- Welcome back. Nearly four years after Elon Musk's funding secured tweet hit Twitter feeds back in 2018, we now have more details from a federal judge's ruling over Musk's now infamous announcement that he was planning on taking Tesla private. Yahoo Finance's own legal correspondent Alexis Keenan is here with the details from the unsealed ruling. Alexis?

ALEXIS KEENAN: Hi, guys. Yes, so the saga continues. And we all know these tweets, right? And you can see them there on the screen. This is the I'm taking Tesla private at $4.20 per share tweets. A series of them, really. So that's the first one. That was followed by investor support is confirmed by Elon Musk, also followed by only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on a shareholder vote.

So this is a shareholder proposed class action in the state of California. It's a federal lawsuit, and it's a consolidated group of shareholders' actions that are all in California. Trial is not set until January of next year. However, the case is moving along. And what this judge in California decided is that these tweets by Musk were, A, he concluded, false. And he also said the tweets were reckless.

And this is really unusual for a judge to make this kind of ruling. This is a partial summary judgment in favor of these plaintiffs. So they get a big win here. They get to move forward with their case with the judge agreeing with them that these were not only untoward, but false and reckless.

Also, what is, I think, the highlight of some of these pleadings as we're getting to read the judge's decision here is that we get to look at some of the events that led up to those tweets, OK? So to Musk's credit, there was a lot going on about taking Tesla private. It goes all the way back to 2017, with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund contacting Musk. And that was followed by a meeting that was attended by SoftBank's [INAUDIBLE], as well as Larry Ellison, all of them talking about let's take Tesla private.

Story continues

So I want to read part of that in the order here that the judge wrote, talking about it, saying at that meeting, that Saudis' fund representative and [INAUDIBLE] expressed interest in making a large potential investment in Tesla in any form that Elon would desire. And that included taking Tesla private. So sometimes, he might have a point here. And what he was thinking, we can never get into his head and know, but this is what the judges decided at this juncture, not really agreeing with Musk here.

- And then separately, Alexis, we know that Tesla will have to face a jury trial for the first time over one of its vehicle crashes. What's at stake in this case?

ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, so [INAUDIBLE], this is a wrongful death case, and a very different action from the shareholder one. And it's all over a crash that happened, a Model S driven by an 18-year-old in Florida. It crashed. It was a fatal accident. The 18-year-old died, as did one of his passengers. There were three in the car.

And what this lawsuit is saying is that Tesla was negligent. They say that, in its batteries and battery packs, that they were not safe for this vehicle. They go on to say that, later on, in subsequent models of the Teslas, that there was a design that was invented to better protect the fires that we've all seen erupt in these Tesla vehicles when they do get into these very tragic crashes.

But this case is going to allow-- be allowed to go forward to trial. Both of these cases, I guess, in essence, though, could be settled before that happens. But getting a green light here. And this will be the first time that one of those crashes will be put to the test. And that technology that Tesla was using back then and somewhat, to some extent, still now will really be put in front of a jury.

- All right. Tough times for Elon and Tesla and a whole lot. Nice to see you, Alexis Keenan. Thank you.",2022-05-12T20:46:08+00:00

420,Bear Markets Are a Goldmine for Long-Term Investors,"It’s been an absolute battlefield within the market landscape throughout 2022, with high-growth and tech stocks seemingly walking around with big targets on their backs. Buyers have entirely retreated, and bears have been pushing forward all year long. It’s been exhausting, to say the least, and bears keep reloading.

While this volatile market is an absolute paradise for day-traders, the same can’t be said for investors. Long-term investors don’t benefit from the significant intraday price swings that we’ve become familiar with; they desire considerable, consistent gains on a much larger time horizon.

While day-traders and scalpers have their fun, it brings about an elegant opportunity for investors to add to their long-term positions at valuation levels not seen in quite some time. Although it’s never fun to watch one of your favorite stocks consistently give back gains, it is exciting to know that you can build up a much stronger position, allowing you to ride the wave back up.

The chart below shows the five-year performance of the S&P 500. As we can see, it currently sits at levels not seen since March of 2021. Zacks Investment Research

Additionally, the S&P 500’s forward earnings multiple has retraced down to 17.6X, beneath its median of 19.9X over the last five years and well below its 2020 high of 28.6X. The rocky market environment has provided long-term investors with a rich buying opportunity not seen in some time. Zacks Investment Research

Remain Confident In Your Investment Thesis

There are many reasons why investors start a position in any stock. Whether that is robust future growth rates, rock-solid financial statements, or the stock is being considered the next big thing, there is always a reason behind that first initial buy.

If you’re a long-term investor, there is little reason to move out of a position if your original investment thesis has changed. Think about why you initially took a starter position, and if that reason hasn’t changed, then there should be no fear concerning the long-term picture; short-term noise needs to be muted.

For example, look at this chart of Tesla TSLA. It would've been a massive mistake if an early Tesla investor sold against their confidence and belief in EVs and TSLA’s overall business during the lows in 2019. Zacks Investment Research

Building A Bigger Position

It’s nearly impossible to time the market just right. The market saying of “buy low, sell high” is hardly beneficial; if investors could consistently and accurately forecast these levels, the market would be entirely out of balance.

Of course, there is the “buy the dip” approach as well, which is inherently risky. Many people buy at the dip, yet it keeps dipping – that’s never fun. One of the best ways to build a more prominent position for your long-term winners is the simple approach of dollar-cost averaging.

Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy in which investors split up their initial buys in periodic timeframes, reducing the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. It allows you the flexibility to “buy the dip” and add on to those winners whenever they come into uptrends. This is a great way to limit overall risk, as no investor wants to see an initial position become an unfavorable entry point due to market conditions.

Apple

We all know about Apple AAPL, the legendary tech giant that has taken the mobile phone marketplace to new levels with its flagship iPhone. As is with most, AAPL shares have been disappointing year-to-date compared to how highly it has performed in recent years. The year-to-date chart below illustrates that. Zacks Investment Research

Widening the time frame to over the past five years shows that Apple shares are trading at their lowest level since October 2021. Zacks Investment Research

Additionally, Apple’s current forward earnings multiple sits at 23.9X, an absolute fraction of its 2020 high of 41.5X. These levels are great spots for increasing a position relative to where the stock has climbed over the last five years. Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

Bear markets are never a fun time for market participants. However, they do bring about rare opportunities in the market to buy some top-tier companies at a fraction of previous valuation levels and share prices.

It’s critical for investors in these companies to uphold the long-term picture alongside their original investment thesis. Once the thesis has changed or has been impacted, investors should take a closer look at their position.

Bear markets can’t last forever, although nobody truly knows where the market heads next. But, right now, bears are in control, and it’s vital for investors to gradually build up their positions in periodic increments to enjoy the ride back up and seize the current opportunities presented to them.

422,Albemarle Tops Our List of Lithium Stocks - Who Else is Worth Checking Out?,"This article was first published on Simply Wall St News .

Lithium has been the talk of the town recently and it’s no secret as to why. Recent estimates from McKinsey suggest a global demand of around 3 million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2030. In contrast, the total global LCE output for 2021 amounted to only 540,000 metric tons, a mere 18% of the anticipated need for 2030. These figures point to a potential shortfall in the future and questions are being raised over how this demand will be met.

The rise in this demand is attributed to an increase in consumer demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs). These EVs are requiring batteries that have higher energy densities and longer lifespans, the main component of which is high-grade lithium. The sudden rise in demand has caused raw lithium prices to skyrocket, leaving battery producers scrambling to secure their supply of a commodity that is quickly entering into a shortage. So this begs the question: Which companies are best positioned to take advantage? Mined production volume, modelled for 93% available capacity. Source: Minespans, McKinsey lithium demand model

Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)

Albemarle is a global leader in the extraction and production of lithium, bromine and refining catalyst solutions. Lithium is undoubtedly the largest branch of the business, accounting for 42% of the US$3.3B in net sales for the 2021 calendar year. 
At a current output of 88,000 metric tons of LCE per year, Albemarle asserts itself as a dominant player in the lithium market at 16% total market share. The company is poised to continue in a strong market popsition with plans expand processing infrastructure in 2022 and with the long-term goal of more than doubling their lithium production capacity. With this expansion pipeline, they'll be targeting low-cost juristictions to reduce capital expenditure and impove returns.

Here are where we see Albemarle’s competitive advantage lay:

Project feasibility. Albemarle has proved it can already economically produce battery grade lithium in a period where lithium prices were much lower, illustrating the company’s ability to continue operations should lithium prices fall. Ability to be self-funded. Albemarle's lithium branch is already profit making, so earnings can be retained and capital can be invested into the aforementioned expansion projects without the need for significant capital raises or taking on large amounts of debt. Smaller companies and emerging players will have to undergo financing stages which carry risks and may result in shareholder dilution.

Story continues

Albemarle has a firm grasp on the market and seems positioned to continue riding this lithium wave from strength to strength. But these factors don’t paint the full picture and investors should always consider the financials of a company to inform their assessment.

Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM)

Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM) stands as the NYSE’s other lithium giant. Producing 101,000 metric tons of LCE during 2021, SQM’s impressive output accounts for 18.7% of global lithium production for the year and with several project expansions in the works, this output will continue to scale with the market demand.

According to SQM’s latest earnings report, 2022 sales estimates top out at 140,000 metric tons of lithium, with capacity potentially reaching 190,000-200,000 should expansion projects be completed in time, and dependant on the market demand for lithium.

Here are the key factors driving the company forward in the next few years:

Significant Expansion pipeline. With SQM’s joint venture in Mt Holland expecting to enter production in 2024 and a drastic increase to the production capabilities of their Salar del Carmen project, there’s ample opportunity for the company to grow their presence in the market and beat out new entrants. Variable exposure to lithium prices. Looking forward to 2022, SQM’s sales contracts are detailed as follows: 20% fixed or variable price, 50% variable price with a ceiling and 30% not contracted. This means that SQM will still be exposed to the increase in lithium prices on previously negotiated contracts even if the price of lithium was lower at the time the contract was agreed upon, opening the company up to increased revenues.

Investors should always consider the risks and financial health of a company to inform their investment decision. You can see our rundown of SQM’s risks and financials for free on our website .

Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM)

Livent’s premier resource is located in Salar Del Hombre Muerto in Argentina, achieving a reasonable current output of 27,000 metric tons of Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Chloride. While this is modest in comparison to the big players in the sector, expansion is at the forefront of the company’s mission, with a 20,0000 metric tons expansion of their Argentinian operation slated for 2023 and a further 20,000 metric tons anticipated for 2025.

Livent’s production figures account for around 5% of the total market share. While this lags the other two companies, Livent’s key focus on cost leadership within the production of LCE, Lithium Hydroxide and Lithium Chloride should provide an advantage over its peers.

These are the factors that are important to the performance of Livent:

Low cost focus. High lithium prices can make many more projects economically feasible, but striving for lower operating costs will mean a project can weather the storm if demand and prices fall. By securing a low-impurity lithium resource, Livent has allowed processing costs to be cut, giving a competitive advantage over other brine operations. Exposure to Lithium Carbonate, Lithium Chloride and Lithium Hydroxide prices. New high-density batteries are more compatible with lithium hydroxide owing to greater nickel content in the cathodes. Should primary lithium demand switch from carbonate to hydroxide, Livent’s exposure to the prices in both products should help it navigate pricing volatility.

Livent is a smaller company and that does carry some possible risks. Investors who are interested in finding out more can do so for free on our website .

The Future Prospects

When you take a step back and look at the global lithium sector, you begin to see a trend. Most supply comes from a select few companies, leaving a mass of newcomers are scrambling to secure funding to bring their projects to market. After all, there’s no shortage of lithium resources on Earth, just a shortage of processing power to extract it from the ground and refine it. New companies coming to the table will reach maturity and begin reaping the rewards of their capital investments. These next few companies aren’t generating significant revenues but we believe they’ll be ones to watch.

Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)

Lithium Americas is an emerging player in the sector. Their flagship project is their Cauchari-Olaroz brine resource in Argentina, which is currently 85% through the construction of its Stage 1 production facility, targeting 40,000 metric tons per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate. Lithium Americas is striving for cost leadership, forecasting operating expenditure of US$3,600 per metric tonne. With a project life of 40 years and a second stage expansion already on the cards, there is plenty to keep investors following their developments closely.

Here are some of the Lithium Americas’ most eye-catching features:

Completed acquisition of Millennial Lithium in January 2022. Lithium Americas now has 100% ownership of the advanced-stage Pastos Grandes project, which is located nearby to their Caucharí-Olaroz tenements. The transaction was completed for around US$400 million and provides Lithium Americas with exposure to a rich brine resource of 4.1 million metric tonnes of LCE. Continued development of Thacker Pass resource. Lithium Americas has a 100% stake in one of the largest resources in the United States. The project’s feasibility study is due in the second half of 2022, targeting 40,000 tpa of lithium carbonate, with scenarios being assessed for expansion up to a total of 80,0000 tpa. Preparation work to begin construction of the initial infrastructure is set to commence in 2022.

Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL)

Piedmont Lithium Inc. is a lithium company looking to develop key strategic assets in North Carolina, Quebec and Ghana. With a consolidated enterprise targeting 60,000 tonnes of LiOH per year and an additional 390,000 tonnes per year in spodumene concentrate (SC6) production, Piedmont is looking to become a significant player in America’s shift to newer energy initiatives.

Here is why Piedmont Lithium’s future may become interesting:

Entered into a binding agreement with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to supply spodumene concentrate from their North Carolina project. The agreement is for an initial five-year term on a fixed price commitment representing one-third of Piedmont’s planned production from their North Carolina project. Deliveries planned to begin between July 2022 and July 2023, but timeline has been postponed indefinitely due to delays in development. The Carolina project offers industry leading sustainability with close proximity to a key target market. Piedmont owns 100% of the project which is set to lead the way in terms of cost and sustainability, offering much lower direct water usage in the processing of lithium hydroxide, requiring only 6,300 gallons per tonne of LiOH. Compare this to Chilean projects in the Atacama region which need up to 124,000 gallons of water per tonne, it’s clear to see where the benefits lay for Piedmont as water scarcity continues to be a frequent discussion point into the future.

423,"Top China Chipmaker, Apple Suppliers Succumb to Covid Lockdowns","(Bloomberg) -- China’s biggest chipmaker and a major iPhone supplier cut their outlooks for the second quarter, joining a growing list of manufacturers warning about the fallout from lockdowns aimed at containing the country’s worst Covid outbreak in two years.

Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co. estimates a month-long lockdown in Shanghai could spur component shortages and logistics tangles and erase roughly 5% of its output in the second quarter. And Pegatron Corp. slashed its outlook for notebook shipments to a decline of between 5% and 10% from the first three months-- versus previous guidance for a rise of 25% to 30%.

“We are trying our best to mitigate the impact on product delivery,” SMIC Chairman Gao Yonggang told analysts on a call Friday morning. “We are still assessing the actual impact as many suppliers restart their operation.”

China’s Covid Zero strategy, which relies on a playbook of closed borders, quarantines, lockdowns and mass testing, is up-ending its giant manufacturing sector even as the rest of the world lives with Covid and opens up. The impact has been particularly keen in the eastern region around Shanghai, which is struggling to contain an outbreak. Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd., another Shanghai-based chipmaker, also warned of potential impact from lockdowns and logistic disruptions on Thursday.

Some have bucked the trend. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., whose main iPhone production base is further inland in Zhengzhou, expects revenue to remain little changed this quarter. Like many companies, it has managed to keep its plants humming by employing closed-loop production sites.

Story continues

SMIC jumped as much as 3.1% in Hong Kong on Friday after reporting profit more than doubled in the first three months, thanks to consistently strong demand for the chips used in everything from connected devices to electric vehicles.

But the pain for manufacturers could deepen if lockdowns persist, or if global macroeconomic uncertainty undermines demand for electronics.

While factories have been given special allowances to reopen under strict guidelines and systems, snarls in the supply chain -- from a shortage of delivery drivers to a lack of materials -- continue to disrupt local operators and global giants including Tesla Inc. and Sony Group Corp. Apple Inc. predicted that supply constraints in China would cost $4 billion to $8 billion in revenue during the current quarter.

And despite a decline in virus cases, the lockdown is intensifying as officials chase the elusive goal of wiping out Covid in the community.

The local government in Shanghai said it plans to achieve “no community spread” of the virus by mid-May, a crucial milestone that has eluded the city despite strict lockdown measures that have now stretched to nearly six weeks. The city of 25 million added over 2,000 cases and two deaths for Thursday.

The Covid pandemic in China as well as war in Ukraine could also shave about 200 million units off global smartphone shipments this year, SMIC Co-Chief Executive Officer Zhao Haijun said on the same call.

“The majority of the amount will be shouldered by Chinese smartphone vendors,” he said.

424,"Musk Says Twitter Deal ""Temporarily on Hold""","By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- Elon Musk said on Friday his $44 billion deal to take Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) private is ""temporarily on hold"", while the two sides wrangle over the extent of fake and spam accounts on the social media network.

Twitter had said in a filing earlier this month that such accounts represent less than 5% of the overall total of accounts using the network. Musk has indicated that he thinks it's higher, and has said that getting them off the network would be one of his top priorities if his deal goes through.

The likelihood of the deal closing has, however, fallen for other reasons this week, owing to the sharp drop in the value of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, which Musk was due to use as collateral for a $12 billion margin loan from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) to finance the deal. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Musk was looking at raising $6 billion in preferred equity from the company instead, reducing the amount he would have to borrow to get the deal over the line.

The merger agreement would force Musk to pay a break fee of $1 billion if the deal falls through due to - among other things - a failure to complete its financing. It's not clear whether the reason given by Musk on Friday would allow him to get around that clause.

Twitter stock fell 23% in premarket trading in response to the news, as market participants assigned a higher probability to the deal falling through. By 6:05 AM ET (1005 GMT), it was indicated at $35.24 a share, around 10% below where it was trading before Musk announced his offer of $54.20 a share. Tesla stock, by contrast, rose 4.8% as the risk of a significant equity overhang faded.

Musk's bid for Twitter had allowed the social media stock to defy the sharp sell-off in the Nasdaq Composite over the last month. That outperformance threatens to reverse sharply if the deal unravels, not least due to the underlying weakness of Twitter's business. The company's latest quarterly results showed revenue grew at its slowest in six quarters, while it also had to admit to overstating its active users for most of the last three years, if only by around 1%.

Story continues

Musk himself has said he would sell his existing 9.2% stake in the company if the bid is not accepted.

The accumulation of that stake is reportedly under investigation by the Securities and Exchanges Commission after Musk missed a deadline to declare his interest as he bought.

425,"Musk's Twitter Deal on Hold, Crypto Rally, China Slows - What's Moving Markets","By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- Elon Musk put his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) bid on hold, ostensibly due to due diligence reasons. Financing problems may also be behind the announcement. Crypto rebounds as Tether withstands a bout of intense demand for redemptions. Stocks and risk assets in general are also set to open higher, but are still on course for a losing week. New data show the scale of China's economic slowdown in April, and G7 ministers meet to discuss raising the pressure on Russia. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, 13th May.

1. Crypto rebound

Cryptocurrencies rallied violently as the panic triggered by the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its associated LUNA token faded.

Confidence returned as the world’s largest stablecoin network Tether successfully negotiated a period of intense demand for redemptions as crypto holders rushed to convert their assets back into dollars or other fiat currency. In contrast to TerraUSD, Tether is backed by real assets, over 40% of which is highly-liquid and risk-free Treasury bills.

Tether returned to trading around its 1:1 peg with the dollar in early dealings in Europe. Bitcoin surged by as much as 13% before paring its gains to be up 8.6% at $30,409 as of 6:15 AM ET. It’s still down around 16% on the week, however, after a rough few days for risk assets in general.

TerraUSD's network tried to resume trading overnight but quickly shut down again.

2. Musk puts Twitter deal on hold

Elon Musk said his bid for Twitter is “temporarily on hold”. The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO said that the move was a response to a filing by Twitter on Thursday that claimed fewer than 5% of the accounts on its network are spam bots or vehicles for fake news. Musk has indicated he thinks the proportion is much higher and has made their removal one of his top priorities.

However, the arithmetic behind Musk’s leveraged buyout offer had become more complicated as the value of his Tesla shares has fallen some 16% in the last week. They’re now nearly 30% of this year’s high. Musk was set to borrow some $12 billion against his shareholding through a margin loan under the original terms of the deal.

Story continues

Twitter stock fell over 20% premarket in response to the news, while Tesla stock rose 4.8% as the risk of a significant equity overhang faded.

3. Stocks set to open higher on short-covering; chipmakers in focus after price hike report

U.S. stocks are set to open higher later, with some short-covering overdue at the end of a volatile week. Sentiment improved toward the end of the day already on Thursday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell again pushed back against the idea of raising key interest rates by 75 basis points at the central bank’s next policy meeting.

By 6:20 AM ET, Dow Jones futures were up 216 points, or 0.7%, while S&P 500 futures were up 1.0% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.6%. That would still leave them on course for losses of between 2.8% and 4.2% this week.

Stocks likely to be in focus later include chipmakers, after Bloomberg reported that industry leader Samsung (KS:005930) is looking to put prices for its semiconductors up by 20%, while Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) stock is bouncing 17% in premarket after its quarterly update.

Also due to report Friday are Jessica Alba’s Honest Company (NASDAQ:HNST), while Honda (NYSE:HMC) ADRs were up 3.9%, after the Japanese auto giant put out better-than-expected earnings - even if it cut its guidance at the same time.

4. Chinese loan growth slows sharply

China's credit growth slowed sharply in April under the impact of spreading lockdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19. These affected nearly 400 million people during the month, according to some estimates, including the key economic hub of Shanghai, much of which remains under severe restrictions.

New loans fell to 645 billion yuan from over 3.1 billion yuan in March, while the broader credit aggregate known as Total Social Financing also collapsed to its slowest growth since the start of the pandemic. The data underline the scale of the slowdown in China, where surveys indicate that both manufacturing and services activity fell in April.

The lockdowns are doing nothing to help the balance sheets of the country's beleaguered real estate developers: Shimao Property (HK:0813), one of the largest, said its contracted sales in April were down 76% from a year earlier, a stark illustration of how the sector's ability to service its debt load is deteriorating.

5. Oil rises further amid fears of Russian output hit; Baker Hughes rig count due

Crude oil prices extended Thursday’s gains as G7 foreign ministers met to coordinate raising the diplomatic and economic pressure on Russia to abandon its faltering invasion of Ukraine.

By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.7% at $017.99 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 1.8% at $109.36 a barrel.

The International Energy Agency estimated on Thursday that Russian oil output could fall to some 1.6 million barrels a day below its pre-war level by June, due to the difficulties of rearranging the large part of its oil export trade due to western sanctions.

Baker Hughes’ rig count and the CFTC’s net positioning data are due later.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks jumped on Friday as surging technology stocks lifted the broader market.

At 10:07 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 381 points or 1.2%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.8% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 3%.

Stocks are trying to shake off a negative streak, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq attempting to clinch its third positive day in four and the Dow trying to snap a six-day down streak.

Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) shares tumbled 11% in early trading after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO and billionaire Elon Musk said his $44 billion deal to take the social media company private was on hold.

The stock rally comes a day after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged in a radio interview that the journey to a soft landing for the economy might not be without some pain.

Powell told NPR's Marketplace in an interview Thursday that his goal of calming inflation while maintaining high employment without tipping the economy into recession ""may actually depend on factors that we don’t control."" He also said with the benefit of hindsight, the Fed might have been better off raising rates sooner. The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is expected to continue to raise them.

The Senate confirmed Powell in an 80-19 vote to continue as Fed chair for a second term.

Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) shares rose 19% after the disclosure that cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of exchange FTX, had acquired a 7.6% stake in the company.

431,Is Musk having second thoughts about buying Twitter? Billionaire slams the brakes on $44 billion deal as analysts question ‘circus show move’,"Elon Musk revealed on Friday that his $44 billion Twitter takeover has been temporarily put on hold as the company investigates how many of its users are fake accounts.

Citing a two-week old Reuters report that said Twitter estimated spam and fake accounts made up less than 5% of its users, Musk said his deal was being paused as he waited for details to support the calculation of the figure.

He later added in a separate tweet two hours later that he was ""still committed to [the] acquisition.""

Twitter shares were down by around 20% in pre-market trading on Friday.

In a filing back in April, Twitter said fake accounts comprised less than 5% of monetizable daily active users in the first quarter of this year.

Musk, who has said he wants to make Twitter “a platform for free speech,” has been critical in the past about the number of bots, or fake accounts, posting on the social media platform.

Twitter shares plummeted in the days following the announcement that Musk’s takeover bid had been accepted, and have taken another tumble in recent trading sessions as the tech sector continues to suffer from a sharp sell-off.

The decline in the company’s shares means Twitter is now valued at around $34.4 billion — $10 billion less than Musk’s agreed takeover price.

Shares plunged to $36.27 in pre-market trade after Musk revealed the deal was being paused — making them around 33% less valuable than the $54.20 he offered to pay per share back in April.

‘An excuse to withdraw gracefully’

Analysts at Wedbush said Friday that Musk’s pausing of the deal was a bizarre “circus show move,” noting that Wall Street was now likely to view the chance of the deal happening as less than 50%.

“The Street will view this deal as 1) likely falling apart, 2) Musk negotiating for a lower deal price, or 3) Musk simply walking away from the deal with a $1 billion breakup fee,” they said in a note.

Wedbush’s analysts added that if Musk does still decide to go down the deal path, a clear renegotiation is likely on the table which calls various matters into question, including financing, the leverage of Tesla stock, prior financing partners, and employee reaction.

Story continues

“Many will view this as Musk using the Twitter filing as a way to get out of this deal in a vastly changing market,” they said. “The nature of Musk creating so much uncertainty in a tweet (and not a filing) is very troubling to us, and sends this whole deal into a circus show with many questions and no concrete answers as to the path of this deal going forward.”

Meanwhile, John Colley, associate dean at Warwick Business School and a former managing director of a FTSE 100 company with experience in mergers and acquisitions, told Fortune that Musk’s latest move suggested he may be rethinking his colossal acquisition of Twitter.

""Is Elon Musk having second thoughts on buying Twitter? ‘Fake accounts’ were always a likely issue, but didn't dissuade him from launching his bid,” he said in an email on Friday.

“Bringing it up now may just be an excuse to withdraw gracefully.”

Colley added: “Maybe the true cost and extent of the risk involved in turning around a ‘break even’ Twitter may have dawned on Elon Musk. After all, $44 billion for what may be little more than a sideline does seem excessive. The collapse in Tesla’s shares following the original offer announcement underlines what the markets think.”

Risk of deal dying

Even before Musk said he was pausing the deal, investors were apprehensive about whether or not his takeover would go ahead, with some warning that “there is elevated risk that this doesn't go through.”

Tesla shares — which Musk was planning to use as leverage in the Twitter deal — have also suffered as a result of both Musk’s latest venture and the tech sell-off.

Twitter said that fake and spam accounts represent less than 5% of the users on its platform in a filing earlier this month. The platform said that it had 229 million users who were shown advertising, a key internal metric.

Musk has made cutting down on the amount of “spam and scam bots” and “bot armies” on Twitter a key part of his pitch for improving the service, alongside prioritising free speech, and open-sourcing the platform’s ranking algorithms.

The billionaire has repeatedly stated that he wants Twitter to become a platform for free speech and to reduce its reliance on advertising.

434,Exclusive-Tesla puts India entry plan on hold after deadlock on tariffs-sources,"By Aditi Shah

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has put on hold plans to sell electric cars in India, abandoned a search for showroom space and reassigned some of its domestic team after failing to secure lower import taxes, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The decision caps more than a year of deadlocked talks with government representatives as Tesla sought to first test demand by selling electric vehicles (EVs) imported from production hubs in the United States and China, at lower tariffs.

But the Indian government is pushing Tesla to commit to manufacturing locally before it will lower tariffs, which can run as high as 100% on imported vehicles.

Tesla had set itself a deadline of Feb. 1, the day India unveils its budget and announces tax changes, to see if its lobbying brought a result, the sources with knowledge of the company's plan told Reuters.

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government did not offer a concession, Tesla put on hold the plans to import cars into India, added the sources, who sought anonymity because the deliberations were private.

For months, Tesla had scouted for real estate options to open showrooms and service centres in the key Indian cities of New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru but that plan is also now on hold, two of the sources said.

Tesla did not respond to an email seeking comment.

An Indian government spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tesla has assigned additional responsibilities for other markets to some of its small team in India. Its India policy executive Manuj Khurana has taken on an additional ""product"" role in San Francisco since March, his LinkedIn profile shows.

As recently as January, Chief Executive Elon Musk had said Tesla was ""still working through a lot of challenges with the government"" in regard to sales in India.

But the strong demand for Tesla's vehicles elsewhere and the standoff over import taxes prompted the shift in strategy, the sources said.

Story continues

Modi has sought to lure manufacturers with a ""Make in India"" campaign, but his transport minister, Nitin Gadkari, said in April it would not be a ""good proposition"" for Tesla to import cars from China to India.

But New Delhi had clinched a win in January, when German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz said it would start assembling one of its electric cars in India.

Tesla had looked to gain an early advantage in India's small but growing market for electric vehicles, now dominated by domestic automaker Tata Motors.

Tesla's price tag of $40,000 at minimum would put it in the luxury segment of the Indian market, where sales make up just a tiny fraction of annual vehicle sales of about 3 million.

Twitter slumped 20% in pre-market trading after Musk tweeted Friday that the deal was suspended, pending details on a recent filing from Twitter that fake accounts on the social media platform contributed less than 5% of its users. Tesla Inc. shares rose roughly 5%.

Twitter said in its latest quarterly results “that the average of false or spam accounts during the first quarter of 2022 represented fewer than 5% of our monthly daily active users during the quarter.”

Fighting fake accounts has been a cornerstone of Musk’s bid to reform Twitter. In a statement announcing his deal to buy Twitter last month, he revealed he wanted to defeat spam bots, authenticate all humans and make its algorithms open source. Musk has also said he’d like to make the platform a bastion of free speech, taking the guardrails off of content moderation.

Bots are currently allowed on Twitter, though under the company’s policy, such accounts are supposed to indicate that they’re automated. The platform has even launched a label for “good” bots, such as @tinycarebot, an account that tweets self-care reminders. Spam bots, however, are not permitted, and the company has policies meant to combat them.

The spread on the deal, which offers an indication of how much Wall Street believes the takeover will be completed, swelled further on Thursday to $9.11 from $8.11 in the previous session. That was the widest level since the billionaire launched his bid last month to purchase the Twitter for $54.20 -- and double where it was last week when he announced a roughly $7.1 billion financing commitment.

Musk’s latest tweet landed just hours after news that Twitter was freezing hiring as part of pre-deal cost-cutting efforts. Two of Twitter’s top leaders are also departing.

The analysts cited the ongoing meltdown in technology shares, Twitter’s own weak first-quarter results, including restating several years of user numbers, and the prospect that Musk will sell his 9% stake if the deal doesn’t come together.

Growth stocks are a critical part of any portfolio. While many retail investors constantly buy and sell stocks, often holding them for less than a week or even a day, history suggests that a long-term buy and hold strategy is more advantageous in terms of achieving big gains in a portfolio.

Holding growth stocks allows investors to ride out the short-term ups and downs of the market and achieve larger gains. It also helps stocks to recover from major downturns such as the Black Monday crash of 1987, the tech bubble bursting in 2000, the 2008 financial crisis, and the pandemic-induced downturn of 2020.

Plus, holding growth stocks for the long term enables investors to benefit from compounding dividend payments, as well as share buybacks and stock splits.

7 Safe Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Now

A study conducted by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) that analyzed the benchmark S&P 500 index between 1993 and 2013 found that people who remained invested all 20 years had a 483% return during that period.

However, investors who sold in and out of the market and missed the 10 biggest moves up in that timespan saw their return reduced to 191%. Missing the 30 best rises in the market over that 20-year period. The return amounted to less than 20%.

The conclusion was that investors who move in and out of the market might avoid some losses, but they also miss out on big gains. With that lesson in mind, here are three of the best growth stocks to buy and hold over the next 10 years.

A sobering headline appeared on the main page of CNBC’s website arecently: “Amazon stock has lost all of its gains from the pandemic.”

A combination of slowing online sales, supply chain difficulties, and rampant inflation have conspired to push AMZN stock down 37% year to date. That’s where the stock was trading at in February 2020 before the global pandemic. The e-commerce giant’s share price is now 42% below its $3,773.08 all-time high.

To be sure, Amazon has issued some disappointing earnings in recent quarters, which has added to the negative sentiment surrounding the company and its stock.

However, there is a reason for investors to remain bullish on Amazon’s long-term prospects among growth stocks.

The company is increasingly diversified and today has its tentacles in everything from film production and grocery retailing to artificial intelligence and flying drones. A 20-for-1 stock split coming in June should make the share price more palatable to retail investors and lead to increased buying.

Plus, you probably wouldn’t want to bet against AMZN stock’s long-term track record. Over the last 10 years, the company’s share price has gained 866%. Since going public in 1997, the stock is up 127,255%.

Looking ahead, the median price target on the stock among 46 analysts who cover the company is $3,700 a share, implying 68% upside from current levels.

Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices showed investors a lot with its first quarter results.

The company reported that its sales grew 71% in Q1 from a year earlier to $5.89 billion. That was well ahead of the $5.52 billion expected on Wall Street.

Earnings per share (EPS) were even better at $1.13, up 117% year-over-year and far ahead of the $0.91 forecast by analysts. Every one of AMD’s lines of business grew by double digits during the quarter.

7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement

In terms of forward guidance, AMD said it expects $6.5 billion in sales in the current second quarter, which was also better than the $6.38 billion forecast by analysts. But despite the impressive growth and strong outlook, AMD stock is still down more than 42% year-to-date.

Rather than sweat the decline, investors should see the current pullback as a huge buying opportunity to buy one of the best growth stocks out there.

At its current level, AMD stock is well below its 52-week high of $164.46. Analysts see big things ahead for the company and its stock, especially after the exceptional Q1 print.

The median price target on AMD shares is currently $140, suggesting that the stock could rise 58% over the coming year. That share price appreciation will be fueled by strong demand for the company’s chips that are used in cloud computing servers and other high-end servers.

In terms of its track record, AMD stock has grown 1,383% in the last decade. Back in May 2012, AMD’s share price sat at $6. Since going public in 1982, the stock has gained nearly 2,000%. Its current outlook suggests more growth ahead for the company and its shareholders.

Recent history shows that it’s a mistake to bet against Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk.

Since going public 12 years ago, TSLA stock has returned 20,882% to shareholders.

In 2012, TSLA stock was trading at $5 a share. Today, the electric vehicle maker’s share price sits at $728. That’s after a decline that has seen the stock fall from its November 2021 all-time high of $1,243.49.

While many analysts quibble about Tesla’s valuation and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 108, there’s no denying that it is among the growth stocks that have been winners for shareholders.

Looking into the future, there’s reason to believe that Tesla can maintain its momentum and position as the world’s dominant electric vehicle maker.

The company recently opened a new manufacturing plant outside Berlin, Germany to help grow its footprint in Europe. It also announced that it delivered 310,048 electric vehicles in the first quarter. That accounts for nearly 60% of all EV sales in the world during the first three months of this year.

The company also reported record automotive margins of 32.9% in Q1 and sales approaching $20 billion. Despite its status as the world’s leading EV manufacturer, Tesla remains in hyper-growth mode.

The 35 analysts who cover Tesla have a median price target on the stock of $1,125.00, implying a 39% gain from where the shares currently trade.

It’s never too early to start retirement planning. The power of compounding can do wonders even if a small amount is allocated every month towards retirement funds. Similar to a dynamic portfolio, a retirement portfolio also needs to be diversified.

Some popular asset classes would include fixed-income securities, gold, equities and blue-chip cryptocurrencies. With equity markets having witnessed a meaningful correction from highs, investors can consider some cheap stocks to buy for the long-term.

Within the equity portfolio for retirement, I would consider holding some growth stocks as well as dividend stocks. In my view, the dividend income can be re-invested to further boost the retirement portfolio returns. Additionally, growth stocks have the potential to deliver multi-fold returns over the long-term.

7 Safe Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Now

Let’s take a close look into seven cheap stocks to buy for a rich retirement.

Among income stocks, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) would be among the top picks. PFE stock offers a dividend yield of 3.2% and it’s likely that dividends will increase in the coming years. In addition to this, the stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.2. Considering the current valuation, there is scope for capital gains.

Pfizer is not just a Covid-19 vaccine play. The company’s growth and cash flow upside are likely to sustain in the long term. However, it’s true that the vaccine sales have provided a cash bump, which provides ample flexibility to invest in research and development.

For 2022, Pfizer expects revenue of $100 billion, which would imply a year-on-year growth potential of 27%. For the same period, the company expects robust research and development expense of $11.5 billion. With a product pipeline of 96 drug candidates, the company’s revenue visibility is strong.

In the first quarter, the company completed the acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals. Further, Pfizer also entered into an agreement to acquire ReViral, which is expected to add $25 billion in risk-adjusted revenue by 2030. Acquisitions are likely to accelerate the growth trajectory over the next few years.

Chevron (CVX) chevron stock

Legendary investor Warren Buffett is known to invest in long-term value creators. In Q1 2022, Buffett was on a buying spree and boosted his holdings in Chevron (NYSE:CVX). The stock is among the top five holdings for Buffett.

Of course, that’s not the only reason to consider CVX stock for the retirement portfolio. Even after a big rally, the 3.4% dividend yield stock looks attractive. Investors can consider buying the oil and gas exploration stock on dips.

With the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the West is looking to reduce energy dependence. There are two ways to achieve this. First, have policies and incentives that help in boosting production in U.S. and Europe. Further, increase investments in renewable energy.

For the first quarter, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $8.1 billion. This implies an annualized operating cash flow of $32 billion. Robust cash flows will allow Chevron to increase dividends and pursue aggressive share repurchase.

More importantly, the company is likely to maintain a high investment expenditure towards renewable and non-renewable assets. The long-term outlook is therefore positive with the company having 88 billion of barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE) in resources. Chevron is also investing in renewable fuel, hydrogen energy and carbon capture. These factors make CVX stock attractive for the long term.

Among FAANG stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been an outperformer so far this year. I believe that at a forward P/E of 24.7, it’s among the cheap stocks to buy for the long term.

Considering the company’s top-line and earnings growth, I would still consider it as a growth stock. At the same time, the company has clear dividend growth visibility.

For the first six months of 2022, Apple reported top-line growth of 10% and earnings growth of 18%. A key point to note in the earnings report is healthy growth in segments like wearable and services. Apple is more diversified with the company having multiple segments that support growth.

Of course, the iPhone segment remains the cash cow. With 5G phones, the segment growth is likely to remain healthy. I also like the fact that Apple is cash rich and it allows the company to make big investments. It’s being speculated that the company will be launching autonomous driving cars by 2025. This is another potential source of revenue diversification and AAPL stock upside.

In the company’s fiscal second quarter 2022, Apple returned $27 billion to shareholders. This level of value creation is likely to sustain with innovation driving growth and cash flow upside.

The escalation in geo-political tensions between Russia and Ukraine is likely to have a long-term impact on global defense spending. Global military spending has crossed $2 trillion for the first time with Europe boosting spending.

In current times, it’s important to have a defense stock in the long-term portfolio. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has surged by 31% in the last six months. However, at a forward P/E of 16.3, it’s still among the cheap stocks to buy a rich retirement.

Besides the stock upside potential, LMT stock also offers an annualized dividend of $11.20 per share. As the company’s order backlog swells, there is clear cash flow visibility for higher dividend income. As of Q1, the company’s order backlog was $134 billion.

During the quarter, the company also returned $2.8 billion to shareholders. With a guidance of $6 billion in free cash flow for 2022, Lockheed is positioned to create value.

The company’s F-35 remains the key cash flow generator. International orders have increased for the aeronautics segment. With a bigger addressable market, the company is positioned for stable cash flows. Also, emerging segments like “Space” should increasingly contribute to growth in the next few years.

There has been a sharp fall in electric vehicle stocks in the last few months. The reasons include chip shortage, supply chain issue and raw material inflation. Also, growth stocks have been battered in the recent plunge.

The deep correction provides a good opportunity to consider some EV stocks. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is clearly one name that’s worth considering on dips. However, among high-growth names, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) looks attractive.

For Q1 2022, Rivian produced 2,553 vehicles and delivered 1,227 vehicles. The company has reaffirmed the guidance for production of 25,000 vehicles in 2022.

Rivian already has an order backlog of 90,000 vehicles for its electric trucks. The company also has an initial order of 100,000 electric delivery vehicle from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). These orders provide revenue upside visibility.

In terms of production, Rivian already has plans to ramp up total capacity to 600,000 vehicles between its Normal and Georgia plants. With $18.4 billion in cash and equivalents, the company seems fully financed for the medium term.

Overall, Rivian has already launched R1T and R1S for the U.S. markets. Additionally, the company’s electric delivery vehicle is likely to boost growth. After a plunge of 78% for year-to-date 2022, RIVN stock is among the names to consider for the long term.

Pinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.

Among growth stocks that have witnessed a significant correction, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) looks attractive. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 23.1 and seems oversold considering the long-term growth outlook.

For Q1, Pinterest reported revenue growth of 18% on a year-on-year basis. However, excluding U.S. and Europe, the company’s revenue growth was 152%. This is one big reason to like Pinterest. The company has a global addressable market and there is ample headroom for growth in international markets.

Another major reason to like Pinterest for the long-term is the company’s effort to make the platform more shopping friendly. The company recently launched the Pinterest API for Shopping. With sustained growth in global e-commerce, Pinterest is well positioned to benefit.

Pinterest reported operating cash flow of $213 million in the first quarter. The company already has an annualized OCF potential of $800 million. With growth in international average revenue per user, the long-term free cash flow outlook is robust.

Of course, PINS is a high-beta stock. I would still include it in the retirement portfolio considering current valuations.

With retail spending being a key driver of the U.S. economy, I would also consider a retailer for the retirement portfolio. Target (NYSE:TGT) is among the cheap stocks to buy from the sector. The stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 15.4. In comparison, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) trades at a forward P/E of 37.9.

For 2021, Target reported 12.7% growth in comparable store sales. This was on top of a 19.3% growth in 2020. Further, the company’s digital comparable sales growth was 21% in 2020 on a year-on-year basis. Clearly, Target has achieved robust growth and is building a strong omni-channel presence.

The company’s sale-day services have been the fastest growing part of the business. The company has also committed to invest significantly over the next few years towards store remodeling, new stores and ramping-up e-commerce sales.

For the long term, Target has guided for high single-digit growth in adjusted EPS. For the last financial year, the company reported operating cash flow of $8.6 billion. Given the growth visibility, OCF is likely to be in excess of $10.0 billion in the next few years. TGT stock therefore looks like a value creator through dividends and stock upside.

Twitter slumped 20% in pre-market trading after Musk tweeted Friday that the deal was suspended, pending details on a recent filing from Twitter that fake accounts on the social media platform contributed less than 5% of its users. Tesla Inc. shares rose roughly 5%.

Twitter said in its latest quarterly results “that the average of false or spam accounts during the first quarter of 2022 represented fewer than 5% of our monthly daily active users during the quarter.” However, Twitter said it applied “significant judgment” to its latest estimate, and the true number could be higher.

Fighting fake accounts has been a cornerstone of Musk’s bid to reform Twitter. In a statement announcing his deal to buy the company last month, he revealed he wanted to defeat spam bots, authenticate all humans, and make its algorithms open source. Musk has also said he’d like to make the platform a bastion of free speech, taking the guardrails off of content moderation.

Bots are currently allowed on Twitter, though under the company’s policy such accounts are supposed to indicate that they’re automated. The platform has even launched a label for “good” bots, such as @tinycarebot, an account that tweets self-care reminders. Spam bots, however, are not permitted, and the company has policies meant to combat them.

Why Spam Bots are Top of Elon Musk’s Twitter Hit List: QuickTake

Doubts have grown in recent days that Musk would be able to pull off his acquisition of Twitter, and that the entrepreneur may consider dropping his bidding price for the micro-blogging site.

Story continues

“There will also be questions raised over whether fake accounts are the real reason behind this delaying tactic,” said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, “given that promoting free speech rather than focusing on wealth creation appeared to be his primary motivation for the takeover. The $44 billion price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform.”

The proposed takeover includes a $1 billion breakup fee for each party, which Musk will have to pay if he ends the deal or fails to deliver the acquisition funding as promised. It is unclear whether an update by Twitter on the number of fake accounts -- if materially larger than 5% -- would trigger a so-called material adverse effect clause, releasing Musk from the breakup fee.

The spread on the deal, which offers an indication of how much Wall Street believes the takeover will be completed, swelled further on Thursday to $9.11 from $8.11 in the previous session. That was the widest level since the billionaire launched his bid last month to purchase the Twitter for $54.20 -- and double where it was last week when he announced a roughly $7.1 billion financing commitment.

Musk’s latest tweet landed just hours after news that Twitter was freezing hiring as part of pre-deal cost-cutting efforts. Two of Twitter’s top leaders are also departing. Kayvon Beykpour, head of consumer product, and Bruce Falck, in charge of revenue product, were both asked to leave the company by Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal, the two executives said in separate public posts.

The changes reflect Twitter’s current state of limbo while it awaits a new owner. Hindenburg Research LLC, an investment research firm that focuses on activist short-selling, said on Monday that it sees a “significant risk” that Musk’s proposed offer gets repriced lower.

The analysts cited the ongoing meltdown in technology shares, Twitter’s own weak first-quarter results, including restating several years of user numbers, and the prospect that Musk will sell his 9% stake if the deal doesn’t come together.

Aside from doubts over the extent of spam bots on Twitter’s platform, the world’s richest person is still working to secure the money to actually complete the deal. Musk has been in talks with investors to raise enough equity and preferred financing to eliminate the need for any margin loan linked to his Tesla shares, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

He recently disclosed $7.1 billion in equity commitments from investors including Larry Ellison, Sequoia Capital, Qatar Holding and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, with the latter rolling his Twitter stock into the deal.

“Musk has never had the full funding – we know that from his constant attempts to get financial support – but he also held all the cards,” said Neil Campling, head of TMT research at Mirabaud Equity Research. “The Twitter board have been held hostage and only have themselves to blame for this mess. No other buyer will emerge – if Musk decides he is still interested he can name his price and it won’t be higher.”

441,3 hot stock tickers on Yahoo Finance right now,"The bears are still out hunting bulls on Wall Street as stocks deal with rampant inflation and the Fed aggressively raising rates.

Apple stock is nearing a bear market on Thursday, dont 19.72% year to date, weighed down by ongoing negative sentiment in the markets on anything that is remotely tied to tech.

Not helping sentiment either are fresh comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell.

The fearless Fed leader said ""pain"" may have to occur as the monetary policy body looks to get inflation under control. Powell — speaking in a Marketplace interview — suggested a soft economic landing during the rate hiking process may not happen.

If the Fed's actions do tip the economy into a recession, it would unlikely be a pleasant experience for investors (as Powell seemingly suggested).

According to Bloomberg data, 14 times over the last 95 years the S&P 500 has plunged more than 20%, meaning it has hit bear market territory. In just two of those examples did the U.S. economy not contract within a year: 1987 and 1966.

Now onto some super hot tickers on Yahoo Finance for this Friday: Rege-Jean Page looks at Elon Musk as they arrive at the In America: An Anthology of Fashion themed Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York, U.S., May 2, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly

Twitter: Now we know why Twitter's stock price has been trading below Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $54.20 offer price for weeks.

“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Musk said in a tweet today.

The stock will likely open Friday's session below where it was just a few weeks before Musk's early April bid for the company. This entire situation is turning into a debacle for Musk, Twitter employees, and civilization.

Robinhood: One person able to close the deal is FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The crypto heavyweight has taken a 7.6% stake in trading platform Robinhood — valued at $648 million —in what he has dubbed a personal investment. The billionaire (net worth around $11 billion even after recent crypto rout) didn't rule out, however, pushing for management and other changes at a company that could only be viewed as a colossal letdown since its overhyped 2021 IPO. Shares of Robinhood surged more than 20% in pre-market trading.

Story continues

Ultimately, Bankman-Fried may be making a defensive move here on Robinhood. Coinbase execs got asked on their earnings call this week if they should buy Robinhood to offer a more complete product to users. They shot down the notion, saying they have no interest in getting into the stock trading business.

But where there is smoke there is fire (especially when the stock prices of all these companies have crashed), and Bankman-Fried appears to understand that.

Affirm: Shares of the buy-now-pay later outfit soared more than 30% in pre-market trading after a better than feared first quarter. Affirm stock is the top trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform. Wall Street generally views the quarter as going a long way to tamping down concerns Affirm can't perform well during an economic slowdown.

The company did show a 73% increase in gross merchandise value in a quarter where U.S. GDP contracted 1.4%. We'll put these questions to Affirm CFO Michael Linford on Yahoo Finance Live in the 10am ET hour today.

By Devik Jain

May 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rebounded on Friday at the end of a bumpy week marked by rising concerns over tighter monetary policy and slowing economic growth, while Twitter sank after Elon Musk put his deal for the social media company on hold.

Twitter Inc slumped 13.8% in premarket trading after the Tesla Inc chief executive said the $44-billion deal was ""temporarily on hold"" while he awaits data on the proportion of the company's fake accounts. Musk says he is still committed to the acquisition.

Tesla shares jumped 7.1%, having lost more than a quarter of their market value since the Twitter deal was announced last month amid a broader market rout.

""The timing of it is interesting. We've just had a couple of rough weeks in the markets,"" said Fiona Cincotta, analyst at City Index in London.

""It isn't necessarily the end of the road for the deal, but I do think Musk will be looking to reprice in light of what we've seen in the stock market recently.""

Other growth stocks Meta Platforms, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc , Amazon.com and Nvidia Corp rose between 1.6% and 3.5% after falling for the most part of the week.

Wall Street has gyrated wildly this week on concerns that the Russia-Ukraine crisis coupled with surging inflation, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and hawkish Federal Reserve policy moves could spark a global economic slowdown.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated on Thursday his expectation that the central bank will raise interest rates by half a percentage point at each of its next two policy meetings while pledging ""we're prepared to do more"" if data turns the wrong way.

The benchmark index was on course for its sixth straight weekly loss, while the blue-chip Dow and Nasdaq were looking at their seventh consecutive weekly fall.

Video Transcript

- As we are watching markets bounce this morning, let's take a look under the hood with our Jared Blikre on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Good morning, Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: Good morning. Trying to open up the frunk here on the Wi-Fi interactive, and the S&P 500, we are getting a bounce back here. But the big question on investors' minds is this just a dead cat bounce? And basically, everything we've seen this year has been exactly that. It's just a question of how high the bounce has been. The last one we had was right before I went on vacation last week. That was that big Fed bounce, and we should have had continuation.

It looked like the market wanted to go higher on that, wasn't able to do that. So we are stuck with high volatility. And I'll tell you what, we are probably due for a flashy short covering rally, could be a rip your face off rally if that's what you want to call it. We've seen some action perk up in the meme stocks. I'm writing about this today on our website. It's going to be posted later. Here's the CBOE volatility index. That's still elevated at 30.

But I think even if we were able to manage a rally to highs, or even nominal new highs, probably going to be short lived because we really haven't seen the capitulation in the majors. That would be the mega caps. So now we're looking at the sector action for today. Energy in the forefront, that's up over 2%, XLE. Also taking a look at consumer discretionary, financials, tech, and materials, all of those are outperforming, all of those up more than 1%.

Staples a big laggard there, but we've seen this before. We've seen these flashy one-day moves. And is there going to be capitulation? I want to point everybody to what I'm going to show here. Here's a 52-week high. This is a percentage return off 52-week high. We can see Apple down 21% there. Amazon's off 42%, Facebook off 50%. But until we see that capitulation in Apple, and I think it has to go down 30%, and you look at the price action in the bar chart, you know when you see it, I don't think this is quite over.

Story continues

- Jared, speaking of ripping faces off, that's the vibe still in crypto land. Do you think we're nearing a bottom here?

JARED BLIKRE: Tough to say because this is a flush out that I was expecting last year when we were testing that $28,000, $29,000 level. Let me put up a two-year chart here so we can see the price action over that time period, preferably in crypto. Looks like we're a little bit stuck here. We'll have to see if I can get that back up. Nevertheless, when we were testing the $28,000, $29,000 level last year in crypto, in Bitcoin, I thought we could possibly go down to $13,000.

This would give the opportunity for a lot of the institutions that are getting into the crypto sphere to get those crypto assets at lower prices. That could be what's in play here. This is a two-year of the Bitcoin, and we can see we are at a major, major level right here. If we were to crack through this, probably going to be a quick drop to $20,000. And as I said, $13,000 is in the cards. But if we manage a lift off here, we get some momentum, we could flirt with these levels for quite some time and eventually see lift off.

But the market would actually be healthier if there were that capitulation event. So not only in stocks am I looking for that in some of the big guys like Apple, but also in crypto.

- Jared Blikre, thanks so much.",2022-05-13T13:54:13+00:00

The stock market is befuddling even the best pro traders. Even market makers and liquidity providers are playing catch up. The dams are springing leaks and there aren’t enough fingers to plug all the holes. Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is falling precipitously into technically important, must-hold support levels.

This is happening through no specific fault of its own. Their operational results are outstanding, and their financial metrics can prove it. Tesla is suffering from two extrinsic ailments. The first is from the lingering effects of Covid-19. There is a global resource shortage that perhaps started from the 2020 lock downs. And more recently, China has renewed restrictions because of virus flareups.

The second challenge stems from noise from Tesla CEO Musk buying Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). There are concerns that Elon leveraging his TSLA stock for the financing could hurt it.

The recent market-wide correction is punishing almost all stocks. For example, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost more than 15% since its May high, ten days ago. There are exceptions like in special sectors like energy. But even those companies are starting to show cracks. Yesterday, Tesla stock traded its first tick below the Feb. 24 flash Ukraine headline low. Consider that the S&P 500 lost that mark almost two weeks ago.

This relative out-performance is encouraging for this volatile stock. This week TSLA stock is having weak moments, but it still closed above the February low. This is further proof that this is no longer a questionable company. Under the leadership of Elon Musk, Tesla has become a shark in the electric vehicle business. Overnight we learned that TSLA paused its efforts in India because it couldn’t get the terms it wanted. That shows the maturity of its team regardless of perceptions.

Hold Tesla Here or Buy It Lower

For years the experts criticized Tesla for its messy start. Little did they know that Elon Musk had what it took to rise up to the task. I must admit I too doubted him at first, but I changed my mind with new evidence. The financials are proof positive that the company is a legitimate powerhouse. Investors looking for a strong car stock to own should consider this one. It has a huge leg up on the competition especially if the EV is the future of cars. Meanwhile, it is likely to sell every one it makes, and its global expansion is just starting.

For years, the complaints were about unfair advantages from tax breaks. Those are no longer an issue, and the only advantage it has is its brilliant first mover one. Tesla is currently miles more efficient with its gross profit. It puts both Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) to shame. Last year, Tesla created almost $12 billion in cash from its own operations. This was just $3 billion less than the other two. Consider that they did this with one third of the sales.

Musk made TSLA stock one that belongs in most portfolios. This, however, does not mean investors should pile in all at once. Buying some now and leaving some dry powder makes total sense. The external risks we noted could still cause further damage to the equities.

454,"EV interest is 'truly surging because of gas prices,' EVgo CEO says","U.S. drivers seem to be giving electric vehicles another thought as gas prices put them off internal combustion engines (ICE) for the time being.

For the third day in a row, the national gas price average has hit a new record high. As of Thursday, the average price for a gallon of gas was $4.41, according to AAA. It's no wonder, then, why Google search interest for electric vehicles and where to find them has also surged.

“The appetite is well and truly surging because of gas prices, in part, but also because there are so many new offerings,” EVgo (EVGO) CEO Cathy Zoi told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “We’ve now got, in the next 24 months, 50 different models of EVs coming to market. So no matter whether you want to drive an SUV or a pickup truck or a compact car, you have a choice with EVs, and they're coming in many manufacturers.”

To Zoi's point, legacy manufacturers and new startups alike have been announcing and rolling out new models at every price point over the past year.

Tesla (TSLA), which leads the U.S. in EV market share, reported another quarter of record vehicle deliveries. Meanwhile, major ICE players like Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) are finding huge demand as they pivot to the electric market. (Ford has even stopped accepting orders for its new F-150 Lightning pickup truck.)

All signs point to 'go' for EV makers — and the electric infrastructure providers that support them. First electric vehicle charging station installed by NRG Energy (EVgo Freedom Station). (Photo: Business Wire via Getty Images)

The 'Wayne Gretzky' of electric vehicle adoption

EVgo, a fast-charging developer founded in 2010, has been rapidly deploying new stations across the country to capitalize on this ""once-in-a-century transformation of a major sector,"" Zoi said.

“We expect to deploy at least 10,000 fast chargers over the next several years, and... we’re now at about 1,700, 1,800 fast chargers,” she said. “It’s a wonderful, fun, interesting, accelerating part of the growth curve for us.”

Historically, the company has chosen to invest in markets where electric car adoption was highest, which primarily meant California. The company claims that 80% of Californians live within a 10-mile radius of an EVgo charger.

But EVgo is looking to expand its reach, especially now that automakers and the Biden administration are doubling down on the electrification of the auto sector.

“We only invest where we can achieve a double-digit return,” Zoi said. “But now we’ve got car companies who are excited to sell the vehicles everywhere, so we’re building everywhere.” A map of existing and planned EVgo fast chargers from the EVgo earnings presentation. (EVgo)

In its latest quarter, the company noted it was focusing its growth in Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, and Indiana. Many of its new charging stations will be built in existing retail locations in partnership with companies like Chase, Meijer, Whole Foods, and WaWa.

The expansion in the Midwest isn't too surprising given the proximity to the new EV plants that General Motors is building in Michigan and battery plants that Ford is building in Kentucky and Tennessee.

This comes after the Biden administration released a $5 billion plan to boost EVs and get more chargers into remote areas, where private investment may be more hesitant to venture. In any case, there is a concerted push by the industry and government to achieve Biden's goal of making EVs account for half of all vehicle sales by 2030 as part of a broader target to lower carbon emissions.

“What we try to do is kind of the Wayne Gretzky thing,” Zoi said, referencing the hockey legend's quip that he skates to where the puck is going, not where it has been.

“We try to build infrastructure just ahead of demand, and right now in much of America the demand is growing, but it’s low,"" she added. ""So that federal funding can help support companies like EVgo to do that, to build ahead of when there’s enough EVs on the road, particularly in rural areas and corridors.”

Even in turbulent markets like we’ve seen lately, Ford (NYSE:F) stock is presenting investors with great opportunities.

Don’t be confused by the short-term uncertainty. Smart long-term investors do their homework when the markets panic. Warren Buffet’s company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B), for example, recently invested more intoOccidental (NYSE:OXY). And I contend that Ford stock is worthy of consideration for those long-term portfolios.

Now, we do need to acknowledge the types of risks that exist now. There are serious geopolitical threats from the Ukraine war potentially spreading across other nations.

7 Safe Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Now

There are also macroeconomic shifts that could derail the economy. These stem from a flip in central bank policies. Mainly my worry comes from the U.S. Federal Reserve, but now the European Central Bank is talking about doing it too.

Rate hikes are fine, but the hawkish tone is getting a bit too extreme. Currency markets are also reacting with big waves. The U.S. dollar’s strength could be a problem to American companies who export, like Ford. Nevertheless, there’s still hope that things will stay on track.

The F Stock Correction Isn’t Entirely Its Fault

This market-wide dip may turn out to be merely a price correction, not the end of the fundamental bullish thesis. Ford stock will recover with the indices whenever that happens.

Moreover, the auto industry is undergoing a major shift in strategy. For the first time ever, the internal combustion engine has a serious threat. The electric vehicle has finally presented itself as the next major shift. Therefore, Ford and all the other major global manufacturers have followed suit.

While this is good news for auto emissions levels, it presents major challenges to auto manufacturers. Shifting an entire global operation from one technology to another will cause inefficiencies. In other words, the profit and loss statements will deteriorate for a stint, but Ford management should be up to navigating the changes.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has laid out the blueprint for them to follow. It was able to become the leader among electric vehicle makers. Wall Street rewarded it with extreme capital appreciation. Ford stock showed brilliance this year above $20 per share. But that high was too strained, so it corrected appropriately.

Own Some Now and Some Later Ford (F) Stock Chart Showing Potential Support

When Ford crashed in 2020 I wrote about going long when it was single digits. Now that it’s at $13, it is attractive once more.

However because we cannot trust the entire market, I would suggest that investors only initiate starter positions. The global unrest could worsen and cause more stock pain for Ford.

Averaging into a full position is an easy method for ensuring a sane overall base cost.

The profit and loss statement also needs improvement, especially if we compare it to Tesla. Ford has almost three times the sales but barely generates more and gross profit. Ford definitely has inefficiencies to sort out, but therein lies some upside potential. Short-term reports on such short-comings could also cause more investors rejections of F.

May 13 (Reuters) - Growth stocks led a rebound in Wall Street's main indexes on Friday at the end of a week marred by worries about the worsening outlook for economic growth, while Twitter sank after Elon Musk put his deal for the social media company on hold.

460,Nio Shareholders Are Fortunate it Makes Electric Vehicles,"Auto sales in China fell 47% in April due to the country’s zero-Covid policy. It’s hard for Nio (NYSE:NIO) and its peers to make cars when their workers are stuck in their homes and not in the factories. That’s one of the reasons NIO stock lost almost 21% of its value last month. However, if you’re a Nio shareholder, there is a silver lining: it could be making and selling internal combustion engine (ICE) -powered vehicles. ICE vehicle sales were down more than 50% in April, while electric vehicle (EV) sales last month fell by 36% from 465,000 in March to 299,000 in April. As the headline states, Nio shareholders are fortunate they’re making EVs, not ICE-powered cars. Here’s why.

The chief executive officer of Automobility, an investment advisory firm based in Shanghai, recently discussed the major issues affecting the global auto industry. In addition to Covid-19, the supply chain is top of mind for Bill Russo, who once led Chrysler’s Northeast Asia business.

Russo believes that EV companies will move to vertically integrate their businesses. That’s not good news for Fisker (NYSE:FSR) or Magna International (NYSE:MGA), its manufacturing partner for the Fisker Ocean SUV.

“If you want to scale up and that supply gets taken by a consumer electronics customer — which was what happened during Covid, they can’t scale up,” Russo told Forbes contributor Russell Flannery. “The solution will eventually be to source customized integrated circuits where you have the ability to control the buy and sell these components. Batteries and chips supply are the key battlegrounds for securing your position in the future of this industry.”

So, how is Nio doing on the vertical integration front? The International Institute for Management Development (IMD) has a Future Readiness Indicator for the automotive industry that ranks companies on their “readiness for deep, long-term, secular trends.” While Nio only ranks 18th on the list — Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is number one — its pace of innovation is pushing higher. IMD notes that while Nio doesn’t focus on manufacturing, its software expertise puts it second-only to Tesla.

“NIO and BYD are built on the capabilities of the future, not of the past. Whether there’s a semiconductor shortage or not, they are busy preparing for the next battleground. Traditional carmakers should be on high alert,” IMD wrote in December.

As bad as things look now with NIO stock down 57.3% year-to-date and trading at its lowest level since August 2020 — it is doing what is necessary to be relevant 10 years from now. While Nio is relatively new to the EV game, IMD sees it as a possible candidate to become the next Tesla. That’s much better than becoming the next big ICE player.

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: Yes, continuing to cover the Elon Musk Twitter madness. Shares of the social media company, they are down on the day by about 8.8% after a few tweets from Musk this morning, one of which where it looked like he was going to put things temporarily on hold, and then one where he followed up himself in a tweet thread to say, but still very much interested in moving it forward, essentially.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and one of the interesting things he's referring to here is saying he's not convinced that Twitter's numbers are correct, that only 5% or less of the accounts on the platform are bots or spam or fake in some way. But as our Dan Howley pointed out, going back at least to October of 2018, the company has had language in its filings with this figure. They said, originally they said monthly active users, less than 5%.

Then they changed it to daily active users. The point is, this is not new information. And so it is curious-- put it on the list, I guess-- it is curious why Musk would come out now to say I'm looking into this and I want to figure it out before I go ahead with this acquisition.

- I do wonder how much longer Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal is in this position. This is not what he signed up for. He signed up to try to transform Twitter, run an actual company. But this is now turning into a complete joke of a job for him.

And you saw him come out here earlier in the week, put a freeze on hiring. I have to imagine how much longer is he in this spot, and then also, too, the employees inside of Twitter. It's something we continue to focus on here, how many-- what does the talent exodus look like at Twitter? It's going to happen if it hasn't happened already.

BRAD SMITH: Well, and it comes back to your point as well, too, in the kind of splitting of hairs that we're looking at right now, because it's daily active users versus what we're seeing classified as monetizable daily active users--

Story continues

JULIE HYMAN: Right.

BRAD SMITH: --from the Twitter side. And so if that's what Elon really wants to go after, to say this is reason for me not to do this deal, the splitting of hairs in terms of how that's classified, then do you really want to do the deal at the end of the day.

JULIE HYMAN: It seems pretty clear he either wants a lower price, or he doesn't want to do it.

BRAD SMITH: Yeah.

- It was good to see him tweet it out though, right?

BRAD SMITH: Using the platform, that he may also own.

JULIE HYMAN: Almost scored. Comes through--

BRAD SMITH: Really there. Really here, there we go.",2022-05-13T15:02:22+00:00
466,10 FinTech Stocks to Buy According to Cathie Wood,"In this article, we discuss the 10 fintech stocks to buy according to Cathie Wood. In order to skip our detailed analysis of Wood's hedge fund performance, stock selection and history, go directly to 5 FinTech Stocks to Buy According to Cathie Wood.

Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management is the fund to watch on Wall Street when it comes to disruptive tech. Wood started her own hedge fund in 2014 after her idea for innovation-focused disruptive tech ETFs was rejected by AllianceBernstein, where she worked as chief investment officer of global thematic strategies. Her early bullish call on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), along with choosing pandemic trailblazers such as Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) and Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC), made her investment choices the talk of the town. Her flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) returned 170% in 2020, even though it initially received plenty of criticism for the unusual style of investing. The critics had their day in 2021 and the start of 2022, as the growth-oriented fund lost more than $13 billion in value, falling over 60%. This is because inflation, soaring energy prices, and the geopolitical tensions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine left investors with little appetite for risky, growth stocks. But come May 2022, and investors are again warming up to Wood's Innovative ETF, recording more than $450 million of inflows in the first week of May.

FinTech combines two very crucial sectors of the economy: financial and technology. Tech is transforming the traditional banking and finance industry by moving it towards digital platforms which provide better, more inclusive financial services for everyday citizens.

Analyst Jeff Cantwell at research firm Wells Fargo says there's a $1.5 trillion growth market opportunity for fintech companies, with annualized growth of 6% over the coming decade. This growth will be driven by the increased adoption of digital payment methods, for both consumers and merchants alike. Another trend is the transition of some firms towards a cloud-based model of 'as-a-service', where subscription fees are charged for e-wallets, account processing and related services.

Not only that, increased relevance of cryptocurrencies in the global payments industry will also lead to growth in the fintech sector. Among the 14 stocks in his coverage which includes Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) and Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN), Cantwell believes fintech stocks can raise profits by 15% in 2022 and 17% in the coming year, figures which are above the yearly growth projections for the S&P 500.

ARK Investment Management's 13 Portfolio: 0.07% ARK Investment Management's Stake Value: $18.34 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82

Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) ranks next on the list of fintech stocks to buy according to Cathie Wood.

Investors were seen piling into Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) at the close of the fourth quarter of 2021, where 82 hedge funds reported owning $7.99 billion worth of stakes in the company.

The company closed the acquisition of MailChimp, which expands its product offering and is accretive to EPS. Management increased full-year guidance to reflect better organic growth and the contribution from MailChimp. We continue to own the stock due to Intuit’s strong competitive position and numerous growth opportunities. We have several investments in software companies that help businesses manage their financial processes and operations. Intuit Inc. provides accounting and payroll solutions for small businesses as well as tax preparation software for consumers and tax professionals.”

7. Adyen N.V. (OTC:ADYEY)

6. StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE)

ARK Investment Management's 13 Portfolio: 0.13% ARK Investment Management's Stake Value: $31.30 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 35

“We also sold and trimmed several names in the emerging market and emerging growth areas, to manage risk and pursue growth companies with a better long-term risk/reward.

Wall Street is a total mess this week, but the list of tech stocks to buy remains quite large. Equities and other asset classes are in free fall. Even Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is now below $30,000. The tech stocks I’ve identified today are all likely to experience sharp recoveries soon enough.

We should recognize that there are short-term risks, like yesterday the indices fell 2.5%. More proof of the chaos is that the CBOE volatility index (INDEXCBOE:VIX) also closed red. Since bond yields also fell, we should not blame the inflation report. Regardless, most companies are still reporting strong P&L’s. Even Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST) collapsed despite growing sales 150%. Risk appetite is very particular these days, and investors favor less frothy tickers.

I limited my list of tech stocks to include nothing but outstanding companies. The uneasiness in the stock market will abate after a while, as the hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric becomes stale. Meanwhile, the indices have room to fall another 12% to 20% from here. Therefore, tech stocks may not have hit an absolute bottom. So it would be a wise to throttle deployment of new trades.

7 High-Risk, High-Reward Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Now

Long term, the overwhelming bullish thesis is that the world is absolutely going digital. This is a one-way trend and we will need smart machines to make that happen. Overall, demand for these products and services will linger for a decade.

Story continues

Ticker Company Current Price AMD Advanced Micro Devices $93.73 NVDA Nvidia $175.30 INTC Intel $43.56 MSFT Microsoft $260.56 TSLA Tesla $767.74 SHOP Shopify $391.65 AMZN Amazon $2,222.22

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

I will start with a successful company that provides brains to the operations. The world needs computers and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) provides strong processing power to make that happen. The company’s fundamentals are excellent, and it’s relatively cheap. Its reputation has grown to the point that it has staunch fans. I, for one, have recently purchased two computers with AMD internals.

The stock chart is approaching a support zone above $75 per share. There are likely to be bulls lurking there waiting to buy it. This has served as a base since summer of 2020. However, investors should look out for small technical hiccups to close a few gaps below that. Below these levels, AMD would make for an excellent value proposition. The rally back should be violent, because Wall Street habitually overdoes things. The bears cannot help but overstay their welcome into winning trades.

Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is suffering a similar fate to AMD. It is its chief headline rival also providing excellent brains to our highly technical world. Nvidia has earned the reputation of the lead innovator in the field. Their financial results support these claims with absolute certainty. Nvidia management grew its revenues more than five times since 2015. They even boast a $10 billion net income. Last year they generated $9 billion in cash from their operations.

However, the stock is not cheap, especially relative to its competition. With a price-to-sales ratio of 17x, it could lose a bit of froth to bring that more in line. Nevertheless, the stock is also falling into a sharp pivotal zone. The support extends from current price through $138 per share. Those levels have been in contention also since 2020, so they will provide support.

7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now for a Rich Retirement

This stock is also in a bearish pattern that may have a few more bucks to go. All it needs is for the indices to stabilize and it will too. There’s no doubt of Nvidia’s excellence, and the buyers will come back to it with force. The rally back should be more violent than the sellers may yet realize.

Intel (INTC)

While Nvidia and AMD hog the headlines, Intel is still the behemoth they are both chasing. Most investors don’t realize that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is larger than the other two twice over. It is still a beast, but not as exciting. Eventually they recapture the investor imagination and earn back the respect they lost. Fundamentally this is the cheapest of them all by a mile.

From a charts perspective, INTC stock has had strong support around $40 per share since 2018. Investors who hold the stock have strong hands. They are not likely to capitulate easily. There is technical risk just like the other two, but it’s likely to find support soon. The rally back in this one may not be as ferocious as the other two. This makes it carry a bit less risk over all.

Microsoft (MSFT)

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an old dog that lived through the dot com bubble. MSFT stock has lost 25% of its value since the high it set last fall. Since it lost the support from early March, it could even overshoot a bit lower from here. But if the indices stabilize, Microsoft has technical reasons to rally back 15% and quickly.

7 Meme Coins to Sell in May Before They Tank

This company proved itself worthy of trust. Microsoft was able to shift a giant ship and steer it straight into winning trends. Under the leadership of Satya Nadella, the company made it look easy too. Wall Street rewarded MSFT for its efforts, as the stock still is miles away from its pandemic lows. While it is not cheap, there isn’t obvious bloat either. Revenues for the trailing 12 months doubled from five years ago. With a net income of $70 billion, investors can sit through a few bumps along the way. If I were long the stock I can confidently wait out these jitters.

Tesla (TSLA)

While you might not see electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a tech stock, it’s full of technology, so I’m keeping it on this list. Currently its financials are impeccable and twice as efficient with its gross margin compared to Ford (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM).

Tesla stock is a bigger beast than the company itself. Over time it has slayed many shorts. Not yesterday though, as it fell 8% and for no specific reason. However it is still doing relatively better than the indices. At least it has not yet lost its support from Feb. 24. But therein lies some technical risk. If TSLA falls below $697 per share, it could accelerate lower.

I am confident that once it stabilizes Tesla will slay more bears. The rally back will be ferocious, so investors should avoid shorting it. Smart money would look for entries near support spots below. It too will need help from the overall markets.

Shopify (SHOP)

The line between tech and retail companies is paper thin. Therefore, I’m including Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) in my list of tech stocks to buy. If there is a stock that can rally fast, SHOP stock is it. Unfortunately it does so in both directions. Case in point, the company just lost 80% of its value since last November. Luckily it had just rallied over 200% out of the pandemic.

SHOP stock took a long round trip road to $1,760 and closed under $320 on Wednesday. Investors drove it straight into the pandemic base. Once it comes back into style, the buyers will overdo it one more time. It is hard to quantify the size of the rebound, as it is hard to pinpoint the absolute bottom. Therefore, taking small bites is best.

7 High-Risk, High-Reward Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Now

Management grew revenues seven-fold in five years. And they did that without creating excessive valuation. Its humble price-to-sales suggests that owners now have realistic expectations. Moderation is an extremely important virtue when dealing with Shopify stock.

Amazon (AMZN)

If we include SHOP, then Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also belongs on this list. After all, Amazon essentially owns the cloud, so most tech-related things pass through their servers.

It too has had a bad time on Wall Street of late. Amazon stock is 44% below its all-time highs. It is also approaching a very sharp consolidation zone. Unfortunately it is also wide, so the floor is more of a band of support. Going all-in to catch this falling machete would be reckless.

Its fundamentals are beyond reproach and its financial metrics are strong. Amazon generates $470 billion in revenues and $20 billion in net income. It has 1the means to do whatever it wants to grow the business further. The team is rarely short on imagination and it has earned every benefit of the doubt. This is a tech stock I could own for a lifetime.

473,Musk puts Twitter deal on hold,"LONDON (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Friday put his $44-billion deal for Twitter Inc temporarily on hold, sending the social media company's shares some 20% lower in pre-market trading and on the Frankfurt stock exchange.

Below are analysts' reactions to the announcement.

PETER TUZ, PRESIDENT, CHASE INVESTMENT COUNSEL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA

""I consider the Musk/Twitter episode a sideshow to serious investing. It’s interesting to watch, and will be fascinating to see the outcome but I’m not letting it distract me from looking for good opportunities.""

DANIEL MORGAN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST, ATLANTA

""My question would be if there's more behind it than just concerns around the number of bot accounts or fake accounts. I know that's been an issue that's come out on previous quarterly calls with Twitter. I'm just kind of scratching my head on why that all of a sudden has become such a major issue for him and something he's using to hold up his $44 billion acquisition.""

""Is there some other issue out there with regards to financing? I know he had a large pool of investors including Larry Ellison at Oracle who were willing to pitch in on the acquisition.""

""Maybe he thinks he can get it at a lower price. The stock is drifting lower. Why all of a sudden has this popped up on the radar screen when he's known about it for a long time.""

ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT NATIONAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK (He disclosed that a family member owns Tesla shares)

""It's a conundrum because when you step back and look at the stock action of Twitter since it received the initial offer from Musk, it never priced in more than a 30-40% chance of this actually getting completed.""

""There's been a lot of contemplation that it might not come to bear here. Now Musk's tweets are stirring up the pot and causing even more confusion. That's why we're seeing the stock reaction we're seeing today. How do we even know what temporarily on hold means.""

Story continues

""Saying it's temporarily on hold is not standard operating procedure when you've made a tender offer for a company. It's confusing and also nonsensical. It just doesn't hold up.""

""Elon Musk, who has secured financing for the tender offer he's already made, will likely be legally bound to either complete this or pay the breakup fee, which is no small thing.""

""It shouldn't affect Tesla shareholders. From the beginning of his initial offering and up until now he's had to pledge less of the Tesla shares as collateral for the financing that he's doing. So the impact on Tesla has diminished over time, but there still is some. If he doesn't have to pledge some of the shares, investors of Tesla may be looking at it and saying, okay, he's not going to be a forced seller to get this deal done.""

STEPHANE EKOLO, GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, TRADITION, LONDON, UK

""I think that the Twitter story stays a Twitter story without an impact to the broader market. After all, this is just an M&A issue""

NEIL WILSON, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, MARKETS.COM, LONDON, UK

""Just always felt like deal was suspect and now get sense it won’t happen and maybe was never going to.""

""I think (short-seller) Hindenburg hit nail on head. Can renegotiate lower price or walks away having offloaded lots of Tesla.""

DANNI HEWSON, ANALYST, AJ BELL, HUDDERSFIELD, UK

""There were lot of investors thinking that the fact that Musk could come in and was offering a decent amount per share was providing something of a safety net at a time when tech shares are falling. The fact that there isn't anyone else to step in does suggest that if this deal doesn't happen, Twitter is going to have to lick its wounds and that's going to take some time.

""Investors just don't know quite what this man (Elon Musk) is going to do next. He's a total maverick. Which makes him either incredibly fantastic or a total liability, depending on which way you look.""

SUSANNAH STREETER, ANALYST, HARGREAVES LANSDOWN, BRISTOL, UK

""Musk’s Twitter takeover was always destined to be a bumpy ride, and now it risks hitting the skids over the number of fake accounts on the platform.

""There will also be questions raised over whether fake accounts are the real reason behind this delaying tactic, given that promoting free speech rather than focusing on wealth creation appeared to be his primary motivation for the takeover.

""The $44 billion price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform.""

EMMANUEL CAU, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY, BARCLAYS, LONDON, UK

""This adds a bit of uncertainty to the tech sector, but I think this is very company specific, I don't see for instance any impact on European stocks.

""It keeps the pressure on the tech sector though, but my feeling is that there's limited read-across impact to be expected. Of course, it doesn't contribute to boost optimism for the sector.""

MICHAEL HEWSON, CHIEF MARKETS ANALYST, CMC MARKETS, LONDON

""Obviously, the markets are reacting as if he is going to pull out of the deal, otherwise why are Twitter shares down 20%. So maybe he's (Elon Musk) paving the ground for pulling out of the deal.

""But the timing is curious given the lengths he'd gone to secure financing for the deal. So, maybe some share holders in SpaceX and Tesla said they want his attention on his primary concerns there. This is straight out of the Musk play book, keeping shareholders on their toes.""

NEIL CAMPLING, HEAD OF TMT RESEARCH, MIRABAUD, LONDON

""Laughable. We'd always said he may cut or run or change his tune at the 11th hour and 59 minutes and 59 seconds on the clock. It is farcical.

""He has never had the full funding – we know that from his constant attempts to get financial support – but he also held all the cards. And the Twitter board have been held hostage and only have themselves to blame for this mess. No other buyer will emerge – if he decides he is still interested he can 'name his price'… and it won’t be higher!

""They (the board) should have seen this coming. There was a specific performance clause in the merger agreement (section 9.9), which gave Twitter the right to 'consummate the closing (of the deal)' but only if he had the financing... which he doesn’t.""

474,"Dogecoin Surges 23%, Unphased by Musk's Announced Delay to Buy Twitter",Dogecoin is up this morning despite a tweet from Tesla's CEO that he's temporarily suspending his intended purchase of the social media platform.,2022-05-13T16:00:24+00:00
475,Musk may be using fake Twitter accounts as an excuse — but they're a real problem,"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk says his planned $44 billion purchase of Twitter (TWTR) is on hold. The reason? He wants to verify Twitter’s claim that spam or bot accounts make up just 5% of its total users rather than significantly more as some suspect.

Musk made his announcement — where else — on Twitter, linking to a Reuters article detailing the disclosure.

Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usershttps://t.co/Y2t0QMuuyn

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2022

But as Variety notes, and Yahoo Finance has confirmed, Twitter has been making the same claim about spam and bot accounts for years in its quarterly 10-Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

""We have performed an internal review of a sample of accounts and estimate that the average of false or spam accounts during the first quarter of 2022 represented fewer than 5% of our mDAU during the quarter,"" Twitter wrote in its recent 10-Q.

Twitter has used identical language in 10-Qs, with the exception of the year, going back to at least 2014. If Musk wanted Twitter to verify that claim, he could have asked about it before making his offer. It's entirely possible he's just using the bot issue as an excuse to back out of the deal.

Still, spam bot accounts pose a major problem for Twitter. They not only inflate user numbers, but they also provide advertisers with an inaccurate count of how many real people they’re actually reaching.

Despite putting the deal on hold, Musk says he’s still committed to the acquisition. Shares of Twitter, meanwhile, fell more than 9% in early trading on Friday. The S&P 500, which has been hammered in recent days along with the rest of the market, was up nearly 2%.

Musk's sudden decision to put the deal on hold feels particularly out of place because he's pointed to eliminating spam bot accounts and limiting content moderation as his main reasons for buying Twitter.

After all, if you’re making a $44 billion acquisition, chances are you’ve done the due diligence to recognize that Twitter has been making the same claim about bots quarter after quarter. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his Twitter acquisition is on hold. (AP Photo/John Raoux, File)

Spam bots have been especially problematic when impersonating major celebrities and executives like Musk. Faux accounts masquerading as the Tesla CEO have, in the past, pushed crypto-related scams, while other fraudulent accounts have stolen users' log-in information or accessed their crypto wallets.

Bots in general are allowed on Twitter, and provide users with automated updates for things like COVID vaccine availability. Sometimes they just provide just a little bit of art to liven up your Twitter feed. Spam bots, however, are specifically designed to either scam users or spread disinformation.

According to The Washington Post, researchers at The University of Maryland found that Musk himself has benefited from spam bots designed to defend him against detractors. Other such bots have pushed for Musk to move forward with his planned Twitter takeover.

If Musk is able to completely eliminate spam bots, it could make Twitter a more hospitable social network, but it would also reduce the platform’s overall user numbers. That could severely curtail Twitter’s ad revenue, not to mention hurt the firm’s stock. After all, one of a social media network’s most important stats is the number of users it has.

It’s not as though Twitter doesn’t try to take down spam bots on its own, either. The company says it has its own enforcement team dedicated to eradicating spam bots. In 2021, Twitter reported that it detects 25 million spam or automated accounts each month.

How Musk will accomplish what Twitter has been unable to do on its own remains a mystery. While he says he’s still committed to buying the platform, if he does back out, spam bots will likely remain on Twitter. They might even continue to proliferate even if the deal goes through.

* Tesla leads gains among megacap growth stocks

* All major indexes set for steep weekly losses

* Indexes jump: Dow 1.45%, S&P 2.36%, Nasdaq 3.67% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Devik Jain and Bansari Mayur Kamdar

May 13 (Reuters) - Growth stocks led a rebound in Wall Street's main indexes on Friday in a week marred by worries about the worsening outlook for economic growth, while Twitter sank after Elon Musk put his deal for the social media company on pause.

All the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with energy, technology and consumer discretionary stocks climbing more than 3% each.

Growth stocks Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com and Nvidia Corp gained between 3.2% and 9.4% after falling for most of the week.

""This is probably more of just trying to catch a trade. There's not really the kind of evidence that suggests this is the market bottom yet, it kind of suggests that we are close but there probably needs to be a bit more pain,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT in Atlanta.

U.S. stocks have swung wildly this week on fears that the Ukraine war, surging inflation, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and a hawkish Federal Reserve policy could spark a global economic slowdown.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated on Thursday his expectation that the central bank will raise interest rates by half a percentage point at each of its next two policy meetings while pledging that ""we're prepared to do more"" if data turns the wrong way.

Money markets are pricing a 69% chance of a 75-basis point rate hike in June.

The S&P 500 index on Thursday came within a striking distance of confirming a bear market after dropping from its all-time closing high on Jan. 3. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is already in a bear market, down 24.6% from its record close in November last year.

Story continues

The benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are on course for their sixth straight weekly loss, while the blue-chip Dow was set for a seventh consecutive weekly fall.

At 11:54 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 458.85 points, or 1.45%, at 32,189.15, the S&P 500 was up 92.62 points, or 2.36%, at 4,022.70, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 416.87 points, or 3.67%, at 11,787.84.

Twitter Inc was among the biggest losers, slumping 8.1% after Tesla chief Elon Musk said the $44-billion deal to buy the micro-blogging platform was ""temporarily on hold"" even though he said he is committed to the acquisition.

Tesla Inc jumped 5.8%.

Robinhood Markets Inc surged 24.8% after Samuel Bankman-Fried, chief executive and founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, revealed a 7.6% stake in the brokerage app company.

Occidental Petroleum climbed 7.4% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed buying more shares of the oil company this week.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.84-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 4.11-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and 30 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded six new highs and 251 new lows.

477,"Stock Market Today: Dow Shows Fight, but Weekly Losing Streak Continues","By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The Dow rallied Friday, led by tech but was unable to snap its weekly losing streak as uncertainty hangs over the economy amid elevated inflation that is pressuring consumers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.5%, or 465 points, the S&P 500 rose 2.4%, and the Nasdaq rallied 3.8%.

Growth sectors of the market including tech flourished after the recent selloff appeared to entice bargain-seeking investors back into big tech, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:FB) leading the charge.

The return to favor of tech stocks has many questioning whether this is a short-term relief rally that could soon fade, or is the start of a more sustained move to the upside.

“I think most of the damage has been done in the stock market … but I wouldn't expect a big snapback to recover all the recent losses,"" Sean Bonner, Founder of Guild and a former U.S. Navy veteran, said in an interview with Investing.com on Friday, flagging the threat of further upward surprises in inflation, which could further impact consumers.

“Ukraine is often referred to as the ‘breadbasket of Europe’ …. If a big portion of that is taken offline, then there could be more inflationary pressures on food commodity stocks, which will affect U.S. PPI and CPI,” Bonner added.

U.S. consumer sentiment on the economy in early May stooped to the lowest reading since 2011, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed Friday.

Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), however, bucked the trend higher, falling more than 9%, after Elon Musk said he would put his takeover of the social media company “temporarily on hold,” citing concerns over fake accounts. The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive, however, affirmed that he was committed to the take-private deal.

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said that he still expects Musk to follow through on his deal to buy the company.

Consumer discretionary stocks were also involved in the heavy lifting of the broader market, supported by a surge in reopening stocks.

Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) were the top gainers in the sector.

Energy, meanwhile, continued to ride oil prices higher amid the tug of war between weaker demand and lower supplies as the war in Ukraine rages on.

In other news, Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) surged nearly 25% after Sam Bankman-Fried, the chief executive of crypto exchange FTX, acquired a 7.6% stake in the trading platform.

485,Elon Brings Volatility Back to Twitter Shares,"Elon Musk, the man behind the all-mighty Tesla TSLA, has quickly become a figure that investors always keep close tabs on. Whether it be cryptocurrency or stocks, all he needs to do is comment about a particular asset for it to skyrocket or dive. Simply put, he’s a potent influential force in the market.

Of course, the most exciting development surrounding him over the last month has been his plans to purchase the social media platform Twitter TWTR. In early April, he revealed to the world a 9% stake in the company, and TWTR shares exploded with a 27% gain, causing shares to reach their highest levels since last November.

Shortly after, he announced his plans to purchase the social media platform for a steep $44 billion and further announced his desire to take the company private. It came as a slight surprise, but many believed that the acquisition was foretold whenever he became the company’s largest shareholder just a few weeks before. Twitter’s board unanimously approved the acquisition at a $54.20 per share price tag.

This morning, the fun came to an abrupt halt whenever Elon tweeted that the deal was temporarily on hold, pending details and clarity of an issue within Twitter’s userbase. A report came out that less than 5% of Twitter’s users across the board are fake or spam accounts; the Tesla CEO wants to make sure that this is true. After all, if a user base highly consists of fake accounts with no real person behind them, it questions the social media’s true success and value.

Following his tweet about his concerns of the userbase, TWTR shares got sent down the drain in pre-market trading from around $46 to $33.50 within a matter of minutes. It was quite the nasty drop, although his concerns were very valid. However, a few hours later, he revealed that he was still committed to the acquisition, giving some relief.

Clearly, his acquisition has been and will be a significant driving force of TWTR shares until a more definitive answer on the matter becomes clearer.

Tesla

Of course, Elon’s bread and butter is Tesla (TSLA). The company has thrust itself into one of the most widely-followed stocks globally and has been one of the biggest winning investments of the last decade. The company’s primary focus is electric vehicles (EVs), although it has other operations within the solar business as well.

A big concern of TSLA shareholders is that Elon will be spread too thin across all of his responsibilities upon the closing of the acquisition of TWTR (if it happens). The share performance of both companies since the announcement of his original stake paints an interesting picture. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

TWTR shares have been much stronger over this timeframe, while TSLA shares have suffered. In fact, it’s been a brutal 2022 all around for TSLA shares, down nearly 26% year-to-date and vastly underperforming TWTR. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Upon his tweet this morning of the deal being on hold, Tesla shares rallied in the pre-market – perhaps a sign that TSLA investors prefer it if the deal isn’t closed.

It’s speculated that the widely-hailed Tesla CEO doesn’t have enough time on his hands to navigate both companies properly, but many believe that this will not be an issue.

Nonetheless, TSLA has been firing on all cylinders outside its share performance. Over its last four quarters, the company has acquired an average EPS surprise in the double-digits of 41%, and in its latest quarterly report, the company crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 50%. Additionally, the current year’s Consensus Estimate Trend has increased almost 10% to $13.57 per share over the last 60 days, reflecting year-over-year growth in earnings of a whopping 68%.

Tesla has also been on a quarterly revenue hot streak, exceeding quarterly sales expectations ten times in a row, and beating sales estimates by nearly 9% in its latest quarterly release. For FY22, the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate has the company raking in $87 billion in revenue, a spectacular 62% year-over-year increase from FY21. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The deep valuation slash in Tesla’s shares year-to-date has brought valuation metrics down to more reasonable levels. Its forward price-to-sales ratio sits at 8.6X, nearly a third of its 23.9X high in late 2021. The ratio is slightly above its median of 4.6X over the last five years but is still the lowest since August 2020.

TSLA is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of an A.

Bottom Line

Elon set out to buy Twitter to uphold the integrity of social media, as many people now see these platforms as potentially harmful to society and nothing but places where negativity is widespread. It will be wildly interesting to see what the Tesla CEO has in store if the deal goes through.

Companies such as Meta Platforms FB and Snapchat SNAP have all been able to find success with diverse revenue streams, while Twitter has seemingly remained stagnant. As of now, TWTR’s share price is well below the agreed-upon price, which also makes the development much more interesting.

He revolutionized the payments space with PayPal PYPL, the EV industry with Tesla, and now he is looking to try his hand at social media as well. Nobody knows if the deal will officially go through, but if it does, market participants are hoping that it doesn’t pull him too far away from Tesla.

486,"If Elon Musk's Twitter plan goes poof, it wouldn't be the first time","Elon Musk says his deal to buy Twitter is ""on hold."" The Tesla CEO has a long record of promising products and initiatives that never arrive. (Associated Press)

Elon Musk may not be delivering on the Twitter acquisition he promised after all.

It’s not the first time he’s fallen short, backed out or abruptly changed course after making a big, showy promise of innovation. In fact, it’s not even the first time he’s done that in the last six weeks, during this specific set of negotiations with Twitter.

For Musk — a serial entrepreneur, controversy-stirring celebrity, terminally online gadfly and the richest man in the world by some counts — abruptly tapping the brakes on a $44-billion tech acquisition with a vague tweet is, well, just another Friday.

“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive wrote early Friday morning in a post on the social network he was otherwise slated to buy. Attached was a link to an 11-day-old Reuters article detailing how the platform’s current management recently pegged the prevalence of spam accounts — a pet issue for Musk and one he’s hinted he’ll tackle if he takes the app private — at less than 5% of monetizable daily active users.

More than two hours later, he replied to himself: “Still committed to acquisition.”

Shares of Twitter's stock dove in response, falling to almost $40, suggesting strong doubt on Wall Street that the deal would ever close. Meanwhile, shares in Tesla leapt 7%, to as high as $786.50, after having tumbled more than 25% from the time Musk started selling $8 billion in the company to finance the Twitter deal.

Musk’s imbroglio with Twitter has been marked by reversals and false starts from the very beginning. When he revealed on April 4 that he’d acquired a 9% stake in the social network, it seemed that might be the extent of his engagement; he had, after all, filed as a passive investor, meaning he was barred under U.S. securities law from pursuing control of the company.

Yet two days later, he filed an update: actually, he'd be an active investor after all.

Story continues

To further complicate things, Musk’s initial acquisition was quickly followed by chatter from both him and Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal that Musk would be joining the company’s board (and capping his stake at 14.9% in the process).

“I’m excited to share that we’re appointing [Musk] to our board!” Agrawal tweeted, to which Musk responded: “Looking forward to working with [Agrawal and the] Twitter board!”

Or not. By April 11, Musk was out.

By the time Musk finally made his big move — a bid to take Twitter private at $54.20 a share — it wasn’t clear what his plan was, or whether he even had one. Analysts were skeptical the offer would lead anywhere, as were traders, with shares lingering well below the offer price. Maybe Musk was too. “I’m not sure I will actually be able to acquire it,” he said during an interview at a TED conference.

But by April 25 — still the same month as when he’d first announced his 9% stake — Twitter’s board had accepted the bid. Agrawal assured employees that layoffs weren’t planned; analysts began thinking about what this meant for digital speech; Musk said he would allow former President Trump, currently banned, to come back on the app.

Now all that is on hold. Again. (Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk does not maintain a press office.)

Unless Musk's tweet was yet another feint. “‘Temporarily on hold’ is not a thing,” Bloomberg financial columnist Matt Levine wrote Friday, suggesting it might have been a gambit to force Twitter to renegotiate to a lower price or face the risk of an ugly legal battle.

For Musk and Musk-watchers, these are familiar cycles.

Following is a partial list of promises and predictions Musk has failed to deliver on:

A Tesla semi truck

In Nov. 11, 2017, Musk announced Tesla would be building an electric semi truck, trumpeting aggressive specifications on efficiency and range. The company began taking deposits from potential customers. Five years later, Tesla has announced no firm plan to build and deliver semi trucks.

A Tesla pickup truck

The same day, Musk announced Tesla would sell a pickup truck, which, he later claimed, would be “a better truck than an equivalent F-150 and a better sports car than a standard [Porsche] 911.” The company has been taking deposits on what it calls its Cybertruck since 2019. So far, the weirdly angular vehicle exists only in prototype, although Musk said recently the company plans to begin production in Austin, Texas, next year.

A new roadster

As an added surprise at the semi-truck event, held at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, a hot-looking sports car called the Roadster was wheeled before a crowd that included Amber Heard, Musk’s girlfriend at the time. Musk later said the car — a radical update of the first model Tesla offered back in 2008 — might be powered by jet engines that would allow it to fly. The company began accepting $250,000 deposits. Although Musk would go on to send a Roadster into space, to date, no plans to actually build and sell the car have been announced.

A network of autonomous taxis

In April 2019, Musk told a Wall Street audience there would be 1 million fully autonomous Tesla robotaxis deployed by 2020. Although competitors such as Waymo and Cruise have debuted limited-scale robotaxi networks, Tesla has done nothing of the kind.

Full-Self Driving

In 2016, Tesla began selling a feature called Full Self-Driving that, six years later, is still not capable of full self-driving. It costs $12,000 a year.

Brain chips

Musk has said in several different venues that his Neuralink brain chip company could one day stop epilepsy attacks, restore limb function, fix speech impediments, cure Alzheimer’s and bring eyesight to the blind. The company has announced no serious progress on any of these claims, and neuroscience experts have raised doubts about how realistic they are. However, earlier this year, the company acknowledged eight monkeys had been killed undergoing brain chip experiments.

And others

A longer list of Musk’s unkept promises and unaccountable predictions would include: A full network of solar-powered Supercharger stations; backup battery storage at Supercharger sites affected by wildfire-induced power blackouts in California; producing 1,000 solar roofs a week; one-hour turnaround time for body work at Tesla service centers; a solar-powered battery factory in Nevada; tunnels with vehicles on electric skates that could take fans to Dodger games at 150 miles per hour; and, recently, a humanoid robot to be introduced ""hopefully next year.""

Then, of course, there was Musk's notorious and legally consequential claim that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private in 2018 at $420 a share. Should the Twitter deal prove to be vaporware, that episode will resemble a form of unintentional prophecy.

489,Elon Musk thinks the American work ethic is alive and well … in China,"Elon Musk praised the work ethic of Chinese manufacturers and said they will help the country produce “some very strong companies” in the near future on Thursday.

He wasn’t so kind when speaking about workers in his adopted home of the U.S.

While workers in China work through the night “burning the 3 a.m. oil,” he told the Financial Times, workers in America “are trying to avoid going to work at all.”

He extolled the many “super talented and hardworking people in China that strongly believe in manufacturing,” saying it’s like a “won’t even leave the factory type of thing.”

Musk’s comments come just days after reports emerged that workers at Tesla’s massive factory in Shanghai have been sleeping on-site and working 12-hour shifts with just one day off per week.

Still, the company has seen production disruptions at its Shanghai plant in the six weeks since the Chinese government placed the city under total lockdown in adherence to its zero-COVID strategy.

Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Tesla was hoping the Shanghai factory would return to its pre-lockdown output of 2,600 cars per day by mid-May, but the factory only made 200 units on Tuesday of this week.

To that end, Musk told the Financial Times that he expects lockdowns in the city to end in the coming weeks, which would help production at the Shanghai plant return to normal.

“I’ve had some conversations with the Chinese government in recent days, and it’s clear that the lockdowns are being lifted rapidly, so I would not expect this to be a significant issue in the coming weeks,” Musk said.

It’s not the first time Musk has been vocal about his admiration for those willing to put in long hours on the job.

In 2018, Musk said that “everyone” at Tesla had been working 100-hour weeks to help meet production demands of the company’s Model 3 car. He also told CBS News that he had been working at least 120-hour weeks himself, and was sleeping on the factory floor because there wasn’t enough time “to go home and shower.”

""I don't believe people should be experiencing hardship while the CEO is off on vacation,” Musk said at the time.

And last week, after tweeting out a Fortune article about job interest spiking at Twitter in the aftermath of Musk’s purchase of the social media giant, the world’s richest man said that if and when his acquisition of the company is complete, “work ethic expectations would be extreme,” but also “much less than I demand of myself.”

490,Why Tesla Stock Jumped Higher on Friday,"On a bright green day for the stock market, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq up a hearty 4.1% as of 3:30 p.m. ET, few tech stocks are revving higher than Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Elon Musk's famous electric car company is cruising through the final half-hour of the trading week with a 6.3% gain today -- and investors have Musk himself to thank for it. The biggest Tesla news today, you see, actually doesn't involve Tesla -- not directly at least.",2022-05-13T20:11:00+00:00
491,Here's why meme stocks are hinting at another flashy rally for `junk stocks`,"Meme stocks are perking up again, with GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) rallying over 30% at one point on Thursday, and adding 10% and 5%, respectively, on Friday. Separately, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) shot up 25% off Thursday's — testing price levels first seen in 2017.

While we've seen this movie before — only to watch dip-buyers get fleeced — a growing chorus of money managers are finding increasing reasons to wade into this unforgiving market.

""Almost everything I look at is screaming to buy,"" wrote Paul Schatz Friday morning after the S&P 500 had minted a fresh, 52-week low.

Schatz pointed out that investor sentiment is mired at historic lows as more and more stocks capitulate. The number of stocks listed on the NYSE making new 52-week lows surged above 1000 for the first time since the pandemic sell-off in 2020. Most pandemic darlings have round-tripped their gains and are now in the red since 2020 (or before).

""[T]he stock market is set up for a face-ripping short-covering rally over the coming weeks or so,"" wrote Schatz. ""It is also possible the final bottom has been seen, but that is not something I am counting on right here.""

Front and center are the high-growth names and meme stocks that have been pounded the most. ""[T]he first bounce should see whatever fell the most rally the most,"" writes Schatz. Indeed, this is what some traders call a junk-off-the-bottom rally.

Of the 45 stocks in the informally-constructed meme stock basket compiled by Yahoo Finance, the median drawdown, or loss, from recent highs is 73% (the average is 65%). Peering inside ARKK, it's not quite as bad — but still not pretty. The median component in the Cathie Wood-sponsored disruption ETF has been cut in half (average 44%).

But even if stocks reward the dip buyers this time around, it's not necessarily the all-clear signal sought by longer-term investors. Signage is seen at a GameStop in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 7, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly

""This will not be a 'V' bottom like 2020 and 2018 when the Fed quickly pivoted and 'risk on' returned overnight,"" Schatz wrote. ""It is going to take some time.""

Story continues

Handicapping the next move by Jerome Powell and his cohort at the Federal Reserve is the biggest piece of the puzzle — and THE major unknown. Investors are still pricing in 50-basis-point hikes for the next three meetings, and the Fed is only beginning to sell bonds from its balance sheet — a pace that will soon reach $95 billion per month.

Any liftoff in risk assets will likely arise from the markets predicting another Powell pivot — this time to the dovish side with a concurrent easing of monetary policy. But that will take time to play out. In the meantime, tight financial conditions could easily cap any fledgling rally.

""The Fed can’t pivot yet, although they will later this year. Huge asset sales are still to come,"" Schatz wrote. ""In other words, the markets have a [great] deal of repair left.""

493,Tesla stock surges after Elon Musk says Twitter deal is on hold,"Tesla investors are bullish on the news that CEO Elon Musk is putting a pause on his deal with Twitter.

Video Transcript

EMILY MCCORMICK: We want to talk more about what this Twitter deal on pause means for Tesla. And at least for now, Tesla investors are cheering. That stock closed higher by 5.7% today. And for more, we have Yahoo Finance's own Pras Subramanian here in studio. So, Pras, what does this whole mean for Tesla?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, Tesla shares gaining sort of a nice relief here, a nice relief rally here, because they had a rough week. And then Elon Musk saying that he's not going to pledge those Tesla shares as collateral for Twitter. So I think that's kind of why we see this nice move in Tesla. But I mean, this whole story, Tesla versus Twitter, Musk involved, it's like, this is the biggest business news story that we can talk about.

And I understand why because it's just so compelling, you know. Musk says he's evaluating this deal, and now he's still committed. Like, what's going on here? I mean, he can't just back out of a Twitter deal. You can't do that. It's like, you can't just pay the billion dollar breakup fee. I mean, that's more of, like, if regulatory people kind of break that up. But you can't just say no to that, right? So he's, more or less, committed. You see Twitter shares right there. [INAUDIBLE] market really is optimistic about it. But hey, you know, it's still a great story. We're talking about it, and Tesla, literally fear for them.",2022-05-13T20:33:13+00:00

495,Elon Musk invited legal scrutiny by tweeting out his doubts about a $44 billion Twitter bid,"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s early Friday morning tweet proclaiming that his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter (TWTR) is on hold may violate laws meant to protect public markets from manipulation, experts say.

Twitter shares began sliding following the tweet, broadening a wider than usual margin over the past two weeks between the market price and Musk's offer price of $54.20 per share. The slide could give regulators and shareholders more reasons to go after Musk, on top of ongoing disputes with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with Tesla and Twitter shareholders.

“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Musk tweeted along with a link to a Reuters report on Twitter's calculation, which came in a recent SEC filing.

Roughly two hours later, though, he tweeted, “Still committed to acquisition.” Twitter post to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's handle May 13, 2022

Musk has a long history of tweeting about corporate strategy, most notably alerting the public via Twitter in August 2018 that he had funding to take Tesla private at $420 share. The tweets prompted an SEC investigation and settlement, and experts say his latest tweet could invite more legal scrutiny. That's partly because information relevant for shareholders must be filed to the SEC; moreover, Musk's tweet arguably caused market moves in both Tesla and Twitter stock in a way that could benefit the Tesla CEO.

Speculation swirled Friday over whether Musk intended the tweets as a strategy to back out of the deal or alternatively to reopen negotiations to buy the company at a lower price after its shares dropped.

“Twitter is going to, and already is, dropping like a rock,” John Livingstone, a research fellow for Case Western Reserve University School of Law, told Yahoo Finance. “As for the SEC rules, this is definitely moving the market in a manipulative way, a way that Musk has been nailed for before by the SEC when he alleged he was taking Tesla private.”

Story continues

Aside from Twitter's stock price, Tesla’s stock moves pose another potential problem. If Musk abandons the Twitter deal, it all but ensures that Tesla shares won’t be deployed as collateral to acquire the social media company, according to Livingstone. In that case, he says, Tesla shares could get an unfair boost and enrich Musk, who's a major shareholder.

If Tesla stock sees a spike, the SEC may be able to paint a picture that Musk used a deal with Twitter to drive down Tesla prices, only to then drive it back up by backing out of that deal. Twitter post to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's handle May 13, 2022.

Musk's mode of communication could also be problematic, as the SEC requires communications to shareholders be filed with the agency to ensure investors aren't misled. As of Friday afternoon, Musk's tweets had not been filed with the agency.

""Musk’s tweet is certainly substantive information about the merger that has been communicated to the public, so it is subject to the filing requirements, and like any material statement about the merger, it cannot be misleading,"" University of Kentucky law professor Alan Kluegel said.

Another risk for Musk is a $1 billion breakup fee he agreed to pay Twitter for backing out of the transaction, if all other closing terms are met. According to the merger agreement, Musk’s acquisition company, X Holdings I, can terminate the deal without paying $1 billion if Twitter breaches certain agreements or takes a competing higher offer, or if Twitter's shareholders fail to vote for the merger.

In putting the deal on hold, Musk raised concerns over the veracity of a recent disclosure by Twitter in a quarterly 10-Q filing that it believes that fake or spam accounts represent fewer than 5% of Twitter's monthly daily active users.

However, Twitter's statement about its percentage of bots may not get Musk out of paying the breakup fee. On one hand, Musk could argue he relied on Twitter's figures when he offered to buy the company. Still, a judge could rule the statement on bots isn't material since Musk has publicly said he wants Twitter to have fewer regulations on users.

As for Twitter and Musk, they both agreed that Musk could freely tweet about the transactions.

“[Musk] shall be permitted to issue Tweets about the Merger or the transactions contemplated,” the merger agreement says, “…so long as such Tweets do not disparage [Twitter] or any of its reps.”

Nonetheless, the SEC and courts have powers that exceed those of the Twitter and Musk.

The SEC already settled with Musk and Tesla over the billionaire’s August 2018 tweets stating that he had secured financing to take Tesla private. The settlement, in addition to $40 million in total fines against Musk and Tesla, required Musk to step down as the company's board chairman.

Several lawsuits filed by Tesla shareholders are still pending over the same tweets. And multiple reports earlier this week said the SEC is investigating whether Musk’s regulatory filings in connection with his Twitter bid followed reporting rules.

At market close on Friday, Tesla stock traded at $769.59 a share up 5.7% from the prior day's market close. Twitter shares continued to trade lower at $40.72 and were down 8.5%.

Bulls are doing the squeezing in Friday’s session, with stock prices inflating on the back of wildly oversold conditions. And while one day doesn’t necessarily make a trend, buying into a more meaningful bottom is looking attractive in some of the market’s most-shorted stocks.

Prices have been scorching higher everywhere this year. From apples at the grocer to gas at the pump or those shoes on Zappos, it’s been an expensive environment for consumers and businesses alike due to inflation and supply chain snarls tied to Covid-19 and Russia.

But for riskier assets it’s been a very different story. In those more enduringly hated companies with high short interest, bears have been making themselves especially at home in 2022.

The 7 Best Energy Stocks to Buy Now

Today though, let’s examine three of the market’s most-shorted stocks to buy. Their shares reveal price charts ready for investors to bullishly profit.

UPST Upstart Holdings $38.13 TSLA Tesla $769.59 CHWY Chewy, Inc. $27.97

Most-Shorted Stocks to Buy: Upstart Holdings (UPST) Upstart (UPST) forming lifetime double bottom with actionable daily chart climatic island reversal pattern

Source: Charts by TradingView

Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST) is the first of our most-shorted stocks to buy. UPST stock has lost favor on Wall Street, except for the attentions of its 30% bearish short interest. That trend has been a costly one to ignore for bullish investors.

This week, the cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) loan referral company saw its shares more than halved in value despite posting its seventh consecutive profitable quarter and fourth straight quarterly report with triple-digit year-on-year revenue growth.

Story continues

Behind the buyer’s remorse, Upstart guided full-year revenues lower by 11% to mid-double-digit sales growth.

Management also offered some token bearish-sounding dialogue in a viciously intolerant market looking for any reason to sell. And the combination resulted in bears ruling the day and analysts slashing price targets, setting themselves up to look even sillier.

With shares off as much as 93.50% this week from October’s all-time-high and putting together a lifetime double bottom with high volume and an island reversal pattern, this most-shorted stock offers an attractive spot to buy long-term growth at a significant discount.

Tesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) putting together corrective high level ""W"" or double bottom

Source: Charts by TradingView

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the next of our most-shorted stocks to purchase.

The world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer isn’t a heavily-bet-against name in percentage terms. But its near-3% short interest is the largest in the market in dollar terms by a wide margin, with more than $20 billion in bets wagered against TSLA stock.

Today, unless we’re going into a global recession so severe as to throw transportation back to the stone ages, it’s time to apply the brakes on the bears’ control.

Technically, Tesla is putting together a higher low, double bottom variation on the weekly time frame. The bullish pattern low follows a failed cup base and bear market cycle of around 48% in depth.

7 Safe Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Now

At the moment, TSLA’s weekly hammer candlestick and stochastics haven’t confirmed a pattern low. But that’s anticipated to happen next week. Should those conditions be met, a summer-dated out-of-the-money bull call spread is one way to drive faster profits alongside controlled risk.

Chewy, Inc. (CHWY) Chewy, Inc. (CHWY) lifetime double bottoming pattern

Source: Charts by TradingView

Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) is the last of our most-shorted stocks buy. The popular online pet supply retailer has long been a trendy name with bears, and shorts today make up around 28% of CHWY stock’s float.

Some of those bets wagered against Chewy have profited handsomely given shares have retreated as much as 81% at this month’s low from last February’s peak of $120. But today, CHWY’s doghouse-like price action is set up for a new bullish cycle.

Technically, as the monthly chart reveals, shares are currently forming an oversold doji candlestick that’s challenging its prior all-time lows. The chart action has the earmarks of a lifetime double bottom in the making.

Coupled with Chewy’s dominant position in a growing pet care market, a very modest large-cap valuation of just $12 billion, a puny price multiple of just 1.22 times sales and a cash-flow-positive business, things look interesting.

And bottom line, over the long term that bodes incredibly well for this most-shorted stock’s chances to learn a new bullish trick.

501,Indonesia's Jokowi meets Tesla's Musk after nickel talks,"JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesian President Joko Widodo met Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Saturday in Texas to discuss potential investments and technology, Indonesia's government said in a statement.

The meeting between Musk and Widodo, better known as Jokowi, came after a round of working-level discussions on a potential investment in Indonesia's nickel industry and supply of batteries for electric vehicles, Indonesian officials told Reuters.

Representatives from Tesla were in Indonesia last week for meetings regarding a potential battery-related investment, Indonesian officials and two people familiar with the talks have said.

Tesla had no immediate comment.

Indonesia for years has been trying to secure a deal with Tesla on battery investment and potentially for Musk's SpaceX aerospace company.

Jokowi traveled from Washington, where he attended a meeting of leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to meet Musk at the SpaceX launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. He invited the billionaire to visit Indonesia in November.

Jokowi is to host a summit of the Group of 20 big economies in Bali in November. ""Hopefully in November,"" the Indonesian government quoted Musk as saying.

Musk said there could be room for ""partnerships in many things, because Indonesia has a lot of potential"", the statement said.

Indonesia has the world’s biggest nickel reserves, and Jokowi is keen to develop a nickel-based EV industry at home - from making nickel metal, to producing battery components and assembling electric vehicles. In the past, he has also urged Musk to consider a rocket launch site in Indonesia.

Two deals over the past month have given new momentum to Jokowi’s push to develop an EV-related industry at a time when global automakers have been scrambling to secure supplies of battery materials and reduce their reliance on China.

A consortium led by South Korea’s LG Energy Solution Ltd, the global No. 2 maker of EV batteries, announced plans last month to invest $9 billion in Indonesia as part of a deal that would include everything from nickel refining to producing battery cells in Indonesia.

LG’s larger rival, China-based Contemporary Amperex Technology, a Tesla supplier, announced a $9-billion Indonesia investment in April.

First Lordstown Motors Corp. said it would back off investing in the tools to build its electric trucks until capital markets loosen up. Two days later, EV Startup Canoo Inc. issued a Going Concern notice to alert investors warning that it could run out of cash.

Without more money, some face the real danger of not making it. Those that can raise money could end up paying a lot more for it or just not getting as much as they need.

“The story has changed,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joel Levington. “These companies are burning huge amounts of cash. Every day that the market goes down their liquidity gets more challenged.”

The problem, Levington said, is that convertible debt for many of the smaller EV companies with little or no revenue is costing more than 10%. They can’t issue much secured debt because they lack hard assets to put up as collateral. With stock prices depressed, issuing equity will be very dilutive to existing shareholders.

Canoo is the most recent company to report a potential liquidity crunch. The company said on May 10 that it has lined up $300 million in funding from existing shareholders and an equity purchase agreement with Yorkville Advisors, along with filing for a $300 million shelf offering. That pads a cash reserve that was just $104.9 million on March 31.

Burn Rate

The company will likely need a lot more. Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts that Canoo will burn through a total of $1.1 billion this year and in 2023, which means it will have to keep trying to raise funds.

Story continues

Just two months ago, Chief Executive Officer Anthony Aquila said his company was “very focused” on avoiding dilution. Aquila said in March that Canoo was instead looking at asset-backed loans and working-capital credit lines -- options he didn’t mention on its first-quarter earnings call this week.

Lordstown Motors, meanwhile, is delaying plans for its Endurance pickup truck. The company reined in a goal to raise $250 million this year, saying that it will seek $150 million instead.

“As you all well know, the capital markets have not been open for the sector, notwithstanding we continue to work with our advisers on available financing alternatives,” Adam Kroll, Lordstown Motors’ chief financial officer, said on the startup’s first-quarter earnings call on May 9. “However, with our options limited at the moment, we are taking a balanced and disciplined approach to allocating our current capital.”

Without that funding, the cost to make its Endurance pickup will be “significantly higher” than the sale price, President Edward Hightower told analysts on the call.

More Yorkville

Lordstown struck a deal in 2021 to sell up to $400 million worth of stock through an investment fund managed by Yorkville -- the same firm now working with Canoo -- but the decline in the startup’s stock price squeezed the amount of money it can make from that agreement.

Instead, Lordstown decided late last year to sell the Ohio factory it bought from General Motors Co. to Hon Hai Precision Technology Co., or Foxconn, for $230 million. That deal gave the company a lifeline. The Taiwanese maker of Apple Inc.’s iPhone also invested $55 million in a joint venture that will help Lordstown develop future products, but the company will need to raise more cash on its own.

Most of the EV startups that went public during the SPAC wave now find themselves back in a tenuous financial position, similar to where they were before their mergers.

Cash Infusion

Canoo had just shy of $150 million in cash in the quarter before its merger in December 2020. Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. had $2 million at the end of 2020 before it revealed its own SPAC combination in January 2021.

Mergers changed their fortunes, at least for a little while. Canoo raised around $600 million, Faraday Future around $1 billion and Lordstown around $675 million. And this all happened quickly, since the mergers took just a few months versus the more protracted process of a traditional IPO.

At least one, though, was able to take advantage of the high-flying optimism while it lasted. Car designer Hernik Fisker’s eponymous startup, Fisker Inc., added $625 million to its $1 billion SPAC merger war chest last August by offering convertible notes when rates were lower.

Still, CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker said this month that while the company had enough cash to get its Ocean SUV to market, the carmaker would still need to raise more money. The company is looking at bank debt or selling zero-emissions credits to conventional carmakers.

“We are talking to several banks to see what we can do with respect to working capital,” Gupta-Fisker said on the company’s earnings call.

Even if these companies can hang on through the current volatility in the market, they all still have a long way to go to find the $23.5 billion Tesla Inc. raised, not to mention a decade of gross profits that funded development.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at a conference this week that starting a car company “is mega pain.”

“It’s the furthest thing from easy money you could possibly imagine,” he said.

When asked if he had advice for other EV startups, Musk said: “Make sure you’ve got a lot of reserve capital and then gradually build up from the dumb things that you do at the beginning and be less dumb over time -- otherwise what will happen is vast losses of money.”

SHANGHAI, May 16 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has delayed a plan to restore production at its Shanghai plant to levels before the city's COVID-19 lockdown by at least a week, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

The U.S. electric car maker originally aimed to increase output at its Shanghai plant to 2,600 cars a day from May 16, Reuters reported earlier this month citing another memo.

But the latest memo said that it plans to stick to one shift for its Shanghai plant for the current week with a daily output of around 1,200 units. It also said that it would now aim to increase output to 2,600 units per day from May 23.

Challenges remain for Tesla to double the number of workers living and sleeping near production lines to maintain ""closed-loop"" operations, said a person familiar with the matter.

Companies in Shanghai are only allowed to reopen if they can operate under such an arrangement, which requires workers to be isolated.

There are also uncertainties over supplies, as factories of suppliers and logistics in Shanghai and surrounding areas have yet to be restored to normal, the person added.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The person declined to be identified as the matter is private.

On one day last week, Tesla operated its Shanghai plant well below capacity, indicating the problems factories face trying to ramp up output under a tightening COVID-19 lockdown.

Shanghai aims to reopen broadly and allow normal life to resume from June 1, a city official said on Monday, after declaring that 15 of its 16 districts had eliminated cases outside quarantine areas.

On Sunday, Tesla shipped over 4,000 China-made cars from a Shanghai port to Belgium, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday, the second batch of exports since its Shanghai plant resumed operation on April 19.

517,Lithium Sector Needs $42 Billion as Pivot From China Adds Costs,"(Bloomberg) -- The global lithium industry needs as much as $42 billion of investment by the end of the decade in order to meet demand for the crucial battery-making material, with attempts to build supply chains outside of China subject to much higher costs, according to a data and market-intelligence provider.

The sector will require $7 billion of investment each year from now until 2028, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said in a report. That would help it meet forecast demand of 2.4 million tons a year by 2030, which is four times higher than the 600,000 tons that’s estimated to be produced in 2022.

The forecast comes as Europe and North America look to reduce their dependency on Chinese imports and develop their own lithium production. That strategy that could require around twice as much capital than relying on getting the refined product from the Asian powerhouse, Benchmark said.

China has enjoyed a stranglehold over the lithium supply chain, bolstered by economic clustering, a high level of expertise, and lower labor and energy costs.

“If you want lithium with as little ESG impact as possible, the solution may cost more outside China,” analyst Cameron Perks said in the report.

In the U.S., the Biden administration has been pushing to accelerate production of key battery metals, with more than $3 billion in grants to help process elements including lithium. Meanwhile, Canada has also earmarked up to C$3.8 billion ($2.9 billion) in this year’s budget to build a domestic critical metals supply chain.

Lithium, which is central to the clean-energy transition, has surged more than 400% in China over the past year, as supply struggles to keep pace with the electric-vehicle boom. Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has made a public appeal for more investment in lithium mining, and said that the car giant might consider mining or refining it directly after prices rose to “insane levels”.

Story continues

The shortfall of raw materials to produce batteries is limiting the production of EVs, meaning their makers may have to get involved in mining if they want to make the cars at scale, Benchmark’s chief executive officer, Simon Moores, said in the report. While lithium’s major producers have large investments planned, those alone will not be sufficient and new mines are needed, the note added.

Automakers could step in and “they have more than one reason to do so,” according to Perks. “Unlike investors, they are not just looking for a return from profits generated by lithium. They are looking to secure supply for their batteries.”

519,When your neighbor asks: 'Has the stock market bottomed yet?',"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe

Today's newsletter is by Brian Sozzi, an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

So I am carrying my inflationary bag of groceries up the stairs on Sunday, trying to decompress for at least seven minutes, when I suddenly hear a neighbor call out: “Hey Sozzi, saw you on TV again. Has the stock market bottomed yet?”

My first thought: “I just can’t escape this sh*t, even for seven minutes.""

I'm used to getting questions like this from a core group of neighbors (and others). This is partially because this particular person noticed, while flipping through Verizon FIOS (where Yahoo Finance lives 24/7 on channel 604), that I was doing live TV out of my kitchen (which happens to be above his kitchen) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I concocted a quick reply in my head, then shouted back: “No idea bro, but I do know the stock market will open for business on Monday morning. Let me know when the co-op BBQ is happening.”

After the exchange, I walked into my place, unpacked those inflationary groceries (you see the prices for deli meat, insane!) and began writing this lovely newsletter for the investing masses.

My response to my neighbor was smart in that hucksters on the Street will be out in force trying to call a bottom for the bruised and battered stock market, even though folks have no clue either since they are the looking at the same market trends and data that you generally have access to.

All this is to say that you want to be very, very careful with bottom calls, given that market conditions will remain treacherous likely until the Federal Reserve signals a pause in rate hikes.

In any case, there are two opposing themes in the current market — and it’s up to you to figure out what fits with the analysis you are doing at this moment.

Story continues

Theme one: Valuations are beginning to look attractive

The forward price-to-earnings multiple for the S&P 500 stands at 16.6 times. This is below the five-year average of 18.6 times and 10-year average of 16.9 times. At first blush, this would mark a good time to begin kicking the tires of stocks of well-run companies that are growing.

But keep this in mind — those five and ten-year averages don’t incorporate a major rate-hiking cycle from the Federal Reserve as we are about to witness. Therefore, I would argue valuations are not yet at super attractive levels (hence we may not be at a market bottom) — but it’s moving in that direction.

Although I do find it interesting that one-time growth juggernaut Netflix shares are trading at 15.2 times forward earnings, per Yahoo Finance Plus data. That is a below market multiple for a FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) stock, which is a rarity.

Curious on what to do if you own a bag of battered tech stocks? Give this a watch.

Theme two: Capitulation hasn’t happened yet

As I like to think of it, capitulation in the markets is when a large down move in a market occurs — one that wipes out all speculators. It’s at that point where a bullish base could start to be rebuilt in a stock or market. While we have seen a few large down days in the markets (and individual stocks, notably in tech such as Rivian, Netflix, and Upstart), the pros I chat with still aren’t seeing capitulation.

“Right now, I think investors are struggling with the bond market as much as the stock market. I think a balanced portfolio is becoming frustrating this year,"" John Hancock Investment Management co-chief investment strategist Matt Miskin said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""Really what we are not hearing is that much capitalization on the volatility side. We had an 18-year run in the stock market.""

In addition, Miskin mentioned investors are actually selling their defensive stocks.

""We are trying to say no, that’s not the answer,"" he added. ""You want to look to add defense to the portfolio as we get to a later cycle. We are not seeing that capitulation yet.”

All in all, my advice to you today is this: Consider a second job to pay for your inflationary groceries, be nice to your neighbors, hit the gym, and beware of stock market bottom calls.

Happy Trading!

Odds & Ends

At least Goldman isn’t looking for another growth decline: Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius slashed his second quarter GDP forecast to 2.5% growth from 2.9% (first quarter GDP fell 1.4%). Hatzius warned that consumer spending is starting to buckle under the weight of inflation and rising interest rates. Look for more investment banks to follow Hatzius this week after we get a key read on retail sales and earnings out of Walmart and Target.

The Twitter saga: Nothing too eventful from Tesla CEO Elon Musk on the Twitter deal over the weekend, just a few shots at Musk's actual plan here. A good note out from Jefferies analyst Brent Thill argued that Musk’s lofty growth goals for the platform are unlikely to be hit. Separately, yours truly and Julie Hyman got into a heated discussion (watch here) on Yahoo Finance Live on whether Musk should have put out a filing Friday on the Twitter deal being put on hold rather than saying it via tweet. Julie says yes on the filing, I say no. We're curious what you think: Drop us a tweet @juleshyman and @BrianSozzi.

Keep an eye on Walmart and Target: If we are speeding toward a recession later this year, small signs of concern will appear in the first quarter earnings out this week from Walmart and Target. One’s first instinct is to think that in a growth slowdown consumers trade down to discount stores to save money. That isn’t entirely off the mark. But this go around given extreme inflation in food, apparel, and other households items may be opting to go without.

In turn, that would mean sales slowdowns at discounters like Walmart and Target even dollar stores Dollar General and Dollar Tree. When Target and Walmart report this week, the most important analysis you can do is this: Look at first quarter “comparable sales” growth and compare it to the trends from the past five quarters. It will give you a good sense on how the consumer is handling high levels of inflation and how they may handle it differently in the months ahead.

Elon Musk Brings Volatility Back to Twitter

Elon Musk, the man behind the all-mighty Tesla, has quickly become a figure that investors always keep close tabs on. Whether it be cryptocurrency or stocks, all he needs to do is comment about a particular asset for it to skyrocket or dive.  Simply put, he's a potent influential force in the market.

Of course, the most exciting development surrounding him over the last month has been his plans to purchase the social media platform Twitter. In early April, he revealed to the world a 9% stake in the company, and TWTR shares exploded with a 27% gain, causing shares to reach their highest levels since last November.

Shortly after, he announced his plans to purchase the social media platform for a steep $44 billion and further announced his desire to take the company private. It came as a slight surprise, but many believed that the acquisition was foretold whenever he became the company's largest shareholder just a few weeks before. Twitter's board unanimously approved the acquisition at a $54.20 per share price tag.

This morning, the fun came to an abrupt halt whenever Elon tweeted that the deal was temporarily on hold, pending details and clarity of an issue within Twitter's userbase. A report came out that less than 5% of Twitter's users across the board are fake or spam accounts; the Tesla CEO wants to make sure that this is true. After all, if a user base highly consists of fake accounts with no real person behind them, it questions the social media's true success and value.

Following his tweet about his concerns of the userbase, TWTR shares got sent down the drain in pre-market trading from around $46 to $33.50 within a matter of minutes. It was quite the nasty drop, although his concerns were very valid. However, a few hours later, he revealed that he was still committed to the acquisition, giving some relief.

Story continues

Clearly, his acquisition has been and will be a significant driving force of TWTR shares until a more definitive answer on the matter becomes clearer.

Tesla

Of course, Elon's bread and butter is Tesla. The company has thrust itself into one of the most widely-followed stocks globally and has been one of the biggest winning investments of the last decade. The company's primary focus is electric vehicles (EVs), although it has other operations within the solar business as well.

A big concern of TSLA shareholders is that Elon will be spread too thin across all of his responsibilities upon the closing of the acquisition of TWTR (if it happens). The share performance of both companies since the announcement of his original stake paints an interesting picture.

TWTR shares have been much stronger over this timeframe, while TSLA shares have suffered. In fact, it's been a brutal 2022 all around for TSLA shares, down nearly 26% year-to-date and vastly underperforming TWTR.

Upon his tweet this morning of the deal being on hold, Tesla shares rallied in the pre-market – perhaps a sign that TSLA investors prefer it if the deal isn't closed.

It's speculated that the widely-hailed Tesla CEO doesn't have enough time on his hands to navigate both companies properly, but many believe that this will not be an issue.

Nonetheless, TSLA has been firing on all cylinders outside its share performance. Over its last four quarters, the company has acquired an average EPS surprise in the double-digits of 41%, and in its latest quarterly report, the company crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 50%. Additionally, the current year's Consensus Estimate Trend has increased almost 10% to $13.57 per share over the last 60 days, reflecting year-over-year growth in earnings of a whopping 68%.

Tesla has also been on a quarterly revenue hot streak, exceeding quarterly sales expectations ten times in a row, and beating sales estimates by nearly 9% in its latest quarterly release. For FY22, the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate has the company raking in $87 billion in revenue, a spectacular 62% year-over-year increase from FY21.

The deep valuation slash in Tesla's shares year-to-date has brought valuation metrics down to more reasonable levels. Its forward price-to-sales ratio sits at 8.6X, nearly a third of its 23.9X high in late 2021. The ratio is slightly above its median of 4.6X over the last five years but is still the lowest since August 2020.

TSLA is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of an A.

Bottom Line

Elon set out to buy Twitter to uphold the integrity of social media, as many people now see these platforms as potentially harmful to society and nothing but places where negativity is widespread. It will be wildly interesting to see what the Tesla CEO has in store if the deal goes through.

Companies such as Meta Platforms and Snapchat have all been able to find success with diverse revenue streams, while Twitter has seemingly remained stagnant. As of now, TWTR's share price is well below the agreed-upon price, which also makes the development much more interesting.

He revolutionized the payments space with PayPal, the EV industry with Tesla, and now he is looking to try his hand at social media as well. Nobody knows if the deal will officially go through, but if it does, market participants are hoping that it doesn't pull him too far away from Tesla.

522,There’s No Greater Divide Than the Tesla Stock Gap,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. looks more than ever like a mature company, with 11 consecutive quarters of profits and long-term production goals. Yet analysts couldn’t disagree more about where the shares of Elon Musk’s company are going.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Goldman’s Blankfein Says US at 'Very, Very High Risk' of Recession Meet the Hedge-Fund Manager Who Warned of Terra’s $60 Billion Implosion How Omicron Infection Turbo-Charges Vaccinated People’s Immunity $11 Trillion and Counting: Global Stock Slump May Not Be Over Terra Hasn’t Killed Crypto, But It Was a Narrow Escape

Their price targets -- predictions for the electric-vehicle maker’s stock 12 months from now -- range from a low of $250 to a high of $1,620, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the widest gap of any company in the S&P 500 Index. Tesla closed at $769.59 Friday.

“It is so hard to value Tesla because some see it as a tech company getting involved with some massive addressable markets: autonomy, EV, robotics and energy,” said Gene Munster, a former technology analyst who’s now a managing partner at venture-capital firm Loup Ventures. “Others see it as just another car company. And based on which side of the coin you fall on, influences your view.”

Analysts tend to largely agree on S&P 500 companies and the future of their share prices: In only about 1% of the cases is the highest price target more than three times greater than the lowest. The most bullish target on Tesla is 6.5 times greater than the most pessimistic.

Musk’s outsized, Twitter-driven public personality and the undeniable cool factor of Tesla vehicles have helped drive investment in the stock. But that doesn’t help analysts guess how much the company will be earning in coming years.

“Looking to the second half of this decade and beyond, it’s still difficult to model what long-term sales and earnings growth will look like,” said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research, pointing to the future of its software sales, Optimus robot and solar products as unknowns. He expects the stock to climb to $1,350 in the next year.

Story continues

And it’s not cheap. Tesla is priced at 58 times estimated earnings for the next year, while all of the big global car companies sell for less than 10 times profit.

Even assuming Tesla is more of a technology company than an automaker, it looks expensive: The price-earnings multiple is higher than all of the so-called FAANG stocks, which enjoy similar reputations as fast-growing businesses and devoted investor fan bases.

“The expectations for future car sales that are baked into the stock price have always been ridiculous,” said David Trainer, chief executive officer of research firm New Constructs, who has a sell recommendation on the stock. The gulf between current profits and the future earnings implied by the stock price remains large, he said.

But bulls have history on their side. Tesla’s shares have climbed more than 22,000% since it went public in 2010, giving investors an annual return of 58%. The S&P 500, on the other hand has returned 373% including dividends in the same period, averaging 15% a year.

The economic and political backdrop also hasn’t dented investor enthusiasm for its stock. Just last month, Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management upped its price target for the stock and now expects it to more than quadruple to $4,600 by 2026.

There’s also Musk’s popularity. The founder and chief executive officer has a huge following with retail investors and that’s not something that can be easily valued.

“There are almost no other public figures who garner the attention of retail investors more than Elon Musk,” said Robert Schein, chief investment officer at Blanke Schein Wealth Management.

523,There’s No Greater Divide Than the Tesla Stock Gap,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. looks more than ever like a mature company, with 11 consecutive quarters of profits and long-term production goals. Yet analysts couldn’t disagree more about where the shares of Elon Musk’s company are going.

Their price targets -- predictions for the electric-vehicle maker’s stock 12 months from now -- range from a low of $250 to a high of $1,620, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the widest gap of any company in the S&P 500 Index. Tesla closed at $769.59 Friday.

“It is so hard to value Tesla because some see it as a tech company getting involved with some massive addressable markets: autonomy, EV, robotics and energy,” said Gene Munster, a former technology analyst who’s now a managing partner at venture-capital firm Loup Ventures. “Others see it as just another car company. And based on which side of the coin you fall on, influences your view.”

Analysts tend to largely agree on S&P 500 companies and the future of their share prices: In only about 1% of the cases is the highest price target more than three times greater than the lowest. The most bullish target on Tesla is 6.5 times greater than the most pessimistic.

Musk’s outsized, Twitter-driven public personality and the undeniable cool factor of Tesla vehicles have helped drive investment in the stock. But that doesn’t help analysts guess how much the company will be earning in coming years.

“Looking to the second half of this decade and beyond, it’s still difficult to model what long-term sales and earnings growth will look like,” said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research, pointing to the future of its software sales, Optimus robot and solar products as unknowns. He expects the stock to climb to $1,350 in the next year.

And it’s not cheap. Tesla is priced at 58 times estimated earnings for the next year, while all of the big global car companies sell for less than 10 times profit.

Even assuming Tesla is more of a technology company than an automaker, it looks expensive: The price-earnings multiple is higher than all of the so-called FAANG stocks, which enjoy similar reputations as fast-growing businesses and devoted investor fan bases.

“The expectations for future car sales that are baked into the stock price have always been ridiculous,” said David Trainer, chief executive officer of research firm New Constructs, who has a sell recommendation on the stock. The gulf between current profits and the future earnings implied by the stock price remains large, he said.

But bulls have history on their side. Tesla’s shares have climbed more than 22,000% since it went public in 2010, giving investors an annual return of 58%. The S&P 500, on the other hand has returned 373% including dividends in the same period, averaging 15% a year.

Cathie Wood stocks, our topic for today, have come under fire in 2022. Yet, during the pandemic, ARK Invest funds, led by Wood’s team, had generated tremendous buzz on Wall Street. The firm’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which seek long-term capital growth, focus mainly on disruptive innovation.

However, 2022 has proved a tough year for such high-growth shares. Concerns over the possibility of a recession in the near future have made investors wary of high-risk technology stocks, including those held by ARK funds.

Just last week, Wood told subscribers to her stock commentary that “volatility could persist until demand destruction and excess inventories make it clear that inflation is not entrenched in the economy.”

Cathie Wood is the brains behind ARK Investment Management, a Florida-based hedge fund which manages a number of exchange-traded-funds (ETFs). The most notable among these is the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) which became the world's largest actively managed ETF in 2020 with around $17 billion in assets under management (AUM). It posted extraordinary returns of 170% in 2020, establishing Cathie Wood as the name to watch in the space of disruptive tech.

But the global trends around inflation and the Russia-Ukraine tensions led investors to abandon risky, growth stocks in favor of defensive plays. This led to Wood's Innovation ETF losing 60% in the last 12 months. However, she has refused to be drawn into the anxious investor sentiment, and instead doubled down on her growth picks, noting that these stocks were now in 'deep value territory'.

Investors are now flocking back towards Wood's ARK Innovation ETF, recording the biggest inflows the fund has seen in a year. In the first week of May, the ETF received investments of $447.4 million, registering the third consecutive week of inflows. Money-watchers realize that fringe picks in Wood's portfolio could very well become the next FAANG stocks, and therefore it would be wise to know which small-cap stocks the famed investor is bullish on. In the first quarter of 2022, Cathie Wood made new purchases in 38 stocks, made additional purchases in 140 equities, completely sold out of 46 firms, and decreased stakes in 167 stocks.

ARK Investment Management's 13 Portfolio: 0.82% ARK Investment Management's Stake Value: $197.16 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Market Cap: $1.10 billion

Stratasys, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) deals in the provision of 3D printing technology. It is based in Minnesota, and offers products such as polyjet printers, stereolithography printing systems, as well as material used in the processes of 3D printing. In early May, the Biden administration launched the Additive Manufacturing Forward, or 'AM Forward' plan, under which leading manufacturers in the US will support the additive manufacturing capabilities of smaller US companies specializing in the technology, thereby helping revolutionize manufacturing across the country. Stratasys, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) stands to benefit from this government initiative as one of the main players in the additive manufacturing space.

On February 24, Lake Street analyst Troy Jensen kept a 'Buy' rating on Stratasys, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) shares and lowered the firm's price target to $40 from $48. He holds that accelerating revenue growth will drive profitability for the firm going forward, and he sees its shares trading at a significant discount to peers.

At the close of the first quarter of 2022, Cathie Wood's 13 filings showed that her hedge fund owned 7.76 million shares of Stratasys, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) with a price tag of $197 million. She also stands as the largest shareholder of the 3D printing firm.

Alger, an investment firm, talked about Stratasys, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) in its Q1 2021 investor letter, stating:

“Short position Stratasys also contributed to performance. Stratasys is one of the larger 3D printing companies. While additive manufacturing (3D printing) is a revolutionary concept, it has only seen its primary adoption for manufacturing prototypes and test parts, not high-volume end-use parts. Unfortunately for incumbents like Stratasys, additive manufacturing has continued to attract capital and dozens of new entrants have emerged with new technologies targeting specific applications. Industry pioneers like Stratasys have seen key patents expire and have lost market share to new competition. As a result of these factors, Stratasys has not grown for five years. Some industry participants believe that Stratasys’ plastic extrusion technology is simply too slow to be an acceptable solution for higher volume manufacturing. The short position contributed to portfolio returns when Stratasys’ shares declined due to year-over-year revenue contraction, continuing market share losses, a talent exodus, the issuance of new shares via a secondary offering, and no significant progress on developing new opportunities in promising additive verticals like metal and dental.”

6. InVitae Corporation (NYSE:NVTA)

ARK Investment Management's 13 Portfolio: 0.92% ARK Investment Management's Stake Value: $220.62 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Market Cap: $862.12 million

531,Elon Musk ‘trying to renegotiate a lower price’ for Twitter: Analyst,"Jefferies Equity Research Analyst Brent Thill joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the expectations for Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover amid accusations that the social media platform has made against him.

Video Transcript

BRIAN SOZZI: Elon Musk's Twitter saga continues today after claiming Twitter's legal team accused him of violating a non-disclosure agreement when tweeting about the company's automated users review process. This is just the latest in a string of controversies surrounding Musk's potential buyout of the social media platform.

Joining us now to discuss is Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. Brent, always good to see. You really enjoyed your note out on this. You mentioned in that note, Brent, that Musk might be trying to negotiate a lower price for Twitter. So my question to you is, inside of this bear market in tech, what is fair value for Twitter?

BRENT THILL: Yeah, I think right now the whole tech market's in a massive selloff. And when he struck this transaction, obviously we saw signs of weakness for the tape. But ultimately, no one believed it would get as bad as it's gotten. So right now we're seeing stocks trade at single digit multiples on EBITDA, in low double digits on earnings, which is kind of unheard of that we've seen in the last decade for tech.

I mean many have said the downside for Twitter effectively could be in the low $30s if this fell through. And clearly, we believe he's just trying to negotiate a lower price. There's been all kinds of public filings that have said that the bots are less than 5% of users. That's in the filings. And so I don't know what the controversy is there. The only way you could spin this is that he's trying to renegotiate a lower price based on what's happened to the overall tech market.

Our belief is we're not done with the pressure on tech. We still think there's downside relative to historic multiples. And so again, I think what we've seen is just pretty violent moves on the up and violent moves on the down. And even while we all think if he walked away, it would go to the low $30s, in this tape, I wouldn't rule out anything, because we've seen everything overshoot even on the down relative to what we consider more bearish levels.

Story continues

So really unclear and again, I think we've never really seen a situation like this where a takeover candidate is publicly commenting on data. So this is just, it's just been a roller coaster. Obviously, many investors are at this point, viewing it as uninvestable at this point, given it feels like he's ready to walk away.

JULIE HYMAN: And Brent, it's Julie here. Given what you're saying and given the stock action that we've seen, is $54.20 overpaying for Twitter?

BRENT THILL: I think at this point, given what's happened to the tape, the multiple, we all think the multiple's outrageous relative to historic M&A in tech. But given what's happened in the short term with the tech market, I think ultimately many would say yes. Now if he can prove that this internal review of the users is actually, there's a higher bot count, then perhaps he could say, well, I'm coming back to the table and renegotiating down $10, whatever the number is. I'm making the number up.

But the point is, I think ultimately valuations have all gone lower and we continue to be in the slide. So $54.20 is probably again, the higher end at this point. I think many of us thought when the deal was going through that we'd see somewhere in the high $50s. So I think everyone's kind of bracketed the transaction somewhere between the high $50s to low $30s. And again, it really depends on the shape of the curve of their overall business, of the overall market and the tape, and the tape has gotten violently negative since this happened.

And so it's not a shocker to see him trying to walk things down. Again, he says he's committed, but clearly, when you have public filings that all you have to do is to a quick search, you can find the bot statement inside their filings, they've commented, it's less than 5%. So I don't understand why you would put it on hold for that. Clearly, everyone thinks that there's something deeper going on that we can't see. And that's what he's trying to do, is throw up a flare so that he can stall the process out.

BRAD SMITH: And so with that being the case right now, if by happenstance this does get thrown aside and it doesn't go through, at least with Musk as a buyer, are there other companies that you imagine could kick the tires on a lower priced deal for Twitter?

BRENT THILL: Well, we know historically there have been a lot of tech companies that have been interested. Salesforce kicked the tires and investors are like, get off the parking lot, we don't want you in this car! And that was a pretty clear statement from salesforce.com shareholders. I'm not saying Salesforce will do it.

The point is, there's I think a lot of potential strategic acquirers. The second camp you have to think about is the billionaire club and who are the other potential buyers with another community of buyers. I think private equity certainly could look at this. I mean, there's a number of camps that could do it.

I think the challenge right now is, there's so much inventory in tech on sale, and we're likely to get worse on fundamentals than better as we head into a recession. Ultimately, I think many investors believe again, and Jefferies firm view is, that if the economy is slowing into '23, that ultimately, we're going to get a better shot on goal, if you will, on the price. So I don't really see anyone kind of waiting ready to jump out of the bushes and say I want it. That's not what we see right now. And clearly, I think during the process that went through, the fact that no one came to save them on the $54.20 tells you a lot.

There wasn't really anyone else out there that was willing to make the move. So certainly, again, assuming the deal falls apart, stock goes to low $30s, we'll see at that point. Again, I don't see anyone at this point. And certainly given the macro environment, why not wait? Why not give yourself six to nine months seeing what's happening with advertisers in a recession? And we know that the first dollar is that gets shut off in a recession are ad dollars. And that's Twitter's, that's Twitter's revenue stream right now.

BRIAN SOZZI: Brent, how much damage is this saga doing to the fundamentals of Twitter? Let's look at a product person inside of Twitter. How can you feel motivated to go to work every day and create some form of interesting new product if you don't know you won't have a job in six months?

BRENT THILL: Exactly. I mean, you nailed it. I mean, it's, I can't imagine. It's kind of like living in a washing machine right now. You're constantly on a spin cycle. And at this point, I think, I guess the other side of this is, that we're seeing layoffs in tech, we're seeing valuation downside. So we're seeing a lot of that in other places, but I think this is pretty severe in terms of the sentiment.

We've already seen a number of senior executives leave. We've had a couple of our companies that we cover inside the rest of the tech industry hire executives out already. So I think you're already seeing execs check out. They're like, I don't want to, I don't want to be in for the spin cycle. So this is only going to make it worse.

And when you look at the comments that he says where he wants to get the company, like, what I don't get, is he lays out this incredibly bullish outline and then says the deal's on hold because of this? Like, that's what I think is so counter. And I think it's really unproductive for the morale and for the team inside this company. I can't imagine going through that. Certainly wouldn't go through it. I wouldn't stand for it, because if you look at these statements that he's made about trying to get the subscription business and the ad business at a certain level, the number of users,

I mean, all these targets, they're never going to hit it. There just never going to hit it. And we published a note highlighting why. You look at these subscriber numbers for a new service, I mean, Disney Plus is like, you know, again, we've drawn the comparison that they're not even at the target, and they're Disney.

So these big iconic brands, I think this is going to be very, very difficult both from a perspective of trying to meet the goals if he wants to meet them, and then secondarily right now, the more he stalls on this, the more morale gets tough, the product quality has already been challenged. We've been talking about this for years.

The Twitter product is not where it needed to be, and that's why he's involved. And we think he can work wonders. So I'd say, look, let's get rid of the sideshow, let's just keep moving forward, try to keep this on track if he really wants to get this done and try to get this deal closed so that they can move on to the next chapter.

535,HOG vs. TSLA: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?,"Investors interested in stocks from the Automotive - Domestic sector have probably already heard of Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Tesla (TSLA). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.

Harley-Davidson and Tesla are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HOG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.

The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.

HOG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.72, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 67.85. We also note that HOG has a PEG ratio of 0.94. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 2.26.

Another notable valuation metric for HOG is its P/B ratio of 2.27. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 22.82.

Story continues

These metrics, and several others, help HOG earn a Value grade of A, while TSLA has been given a Value grade of D.

HOG sticks out from TSLA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that HOG is the better option right now.

Tesla remains ""dominant"" in EVs, reports TheFly.com today, retaining a 20% market share, but competition is heating up and the company lost market share to new rivals in 2021.",2022-05-16T15:49:26+00:00
538,"Working at Twitter right now is 'like living in a washing machine,' analyst says","Elon Musk is damaging the fundamentals of Twitter — including employee morale — by playing games with his deal for the company, argues one long-time tech analyst who covers the social media platform.

""I can't imagine [being an employee there]; it's like living in a washing machine right now — you are in the spin cycle,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""We have seen senior executives leave. Companies we cover in the tech industry have hired executives out [of Twitter]. I think you are seeing execs check out — they don't want to be in for the spin cycle. This will only make things worse."" A woman is seen through a glass door of a washing machine that has been used as a window of a makeshift office at an environment-friendly beachfront cafe in Gaza on July 8, 2021. REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa

Thill's take comes as the Tesla CEO's play for the company has been thrust into fresh doubt, which Musk created himself. The unpredictable billionaire said Friday that the Twitter deal was on ""hold"" as more diligence is done on whether less than 5% of Twitter's users are fake accounts (as the company's SEC filings have stated).

Amid the uncertainty, Twitter shares have now given back all their gains since Musk disclosed his stake in Twitter in early April. As of 11:56 A.M. ET, Twitter shares were at $38.58, below the $39.31 closing price hit prior to his stake being revealed.

And as the saga plays out, Twitter has seen the departures of executives General Manager Kayvon Beykour and General Manager for Revenue Bruce Falck.

Thill noted that a talent exodus at Twitter could ultimately impact its performance and product development.

""I think it really unproductive for the morale and for the team inside this company,"" Thill added on how Musk is handling the situation. ""I wouldn't stand for it. We think he can work wonders. I would say let's get rid of the sideshow, move it forward, keep it on track if he wants to get this done, and try to get this deal closed so they can move onto the next chapter.""

540,Best Automotive Stocks To Buy In May,"Key Insights

Tesla will be an interesting rebound play in case the situation with coronavirus in China stabilizes.  Ford is trading at just 6 forward P/E, which is attractive for value-oriented traders.  The general market is trying to rebound, which could provide additional support to automotive stocks.

S&P 500 has recently moved away from yearly lows, but many stocks remain under material pressure. The stocks in the automotive industry are not an exception as traders are worried that higher costs and potential slowdown of the world economy would hurt automakers’ profits. That said, some automotive stocks are trading at attractive valuation levels that have not been seen for quite some time.

Tesla

Tesla stock has recently found itself under significant pressure due to lockdowns in China. Musk’s desire to buy Twitter has also hurt investor sentiment, although the recent news indicated that the fate of the deal remained uncertain.

Meanwhile, analyst estimates have moved higher in recent months. Currently, Tesla is expected to report a profit of $12.32 per share in 2022 and earnings of $15.8 per share in 2023, so the stock is trading at 47 forward P/E.

Such valuation levels are not cheap for an “ordinary” stock, but Tesla is not an ordinary company. At this point, it looks that demand for the stock may increase in the upcoming weeks in case the situation with coronavirus in China stabilizes after the lockdowns.

Ford

Ford stock is extremely cheap compared to Tesla. The company is expected to report earnings of $2.18 per share in the next year, so the stock is trading at just 6 forward P/E.

However, it should be noted that shares of legacy automakers have traded at a huge discount to Tesla for years, so the relative cheapness of Ford stock cannot serve as the main catalyst for the bulls.

However, Ford is also cheap on an absolute basis. It is not easy to see a world-class company valued at just six times its future profits nowadays. Analyst estimates have been trending lower in recent months, which partly explains traders’ skepticism, but current levels should still attract value-oriented investors.

541,"Stock Market Today: Dow Ekes Out Gain as Energy Shines, but Tech Stutters","By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The Dow eked out a gain Monday as gains in energy offset a slump in consumer discretionary stocks just as concerns about a slowing economy heat up.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.08%, or 27 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.34%, the the Nasdaq fell 1.20%.

Energy jumped more than 2% after oil clawed back earlier losses on fears of a supply shortage as European members appear to be making progress on an agreement to ban Russian oil.

APA (NASDAQ:APA), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) were among the biggest gainers, with the latter up more than 5%.

Financials, meanwhile, were also a drag on the broader market led by Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY), as the cryptocurrency-exposed bank reported a fall in deposits following a rout in crypto markets.

Regional banks, meanwhile, were also nursing losses, adding to pressure on the sector amid growing bets of an economic slowdown following weaker economic growth reported in China overnight.

“Our conviction is that the chances of an outright recession in 2022 remain low,” Wells Fargo said in a note. “However, the probability has risen substantially that the economy could suffer a 2023 contraction.”

Consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest drag on the market, paced by a more than 5% fall in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the U.S. electric automaker recalled 107,293 locally made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China, to fix software problems, according to the State Administration for Market Regulation.

Big tech traded mixed, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the red, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended the session in the green.

Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, shed more than 8% after Elon Musk hinted that he may lower his $54.20 a share take-private offer for the social media company.

This follows comments last week that the deal to buy Twitter was on hold, with Musk citing concerns about fake accounts on the social media platform. The move was widely viewed as a gambit to negotiate a lower price, which if not accepted and results in Musk walking away, “then the stock would likely see a sub $30 level with a broken deal in this shaky market backdrop,” Wedbush said.

On the economic front, regional manufacturing data flagged added to worries about an economic slowdown after a reading of manufacturing activity in New York fell 36.2 points to negative 11.6 in May.

In other news, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) fell 4% after tabling a $30 per share offer for Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) after its previous offer for the company was rejected.

McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), meanwhile, fell less than 1% after announcing that it will sell its restaurants in Russia, leading to a $1.4 billion writeoff.

A slew of retailers including Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and others are set to report quarterly results this week that could offer much-needed clues on the strength of the consumer.

* Indexes: Dow +0.60%, S&P 500 +0.20%, Nasdaq -0.41% (Updates with details on afternoon trade)

By Amruta Khandekar and Noel Randewich

May 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street was mixed on Monday, with energy stocks rallying and Tesla and other growth stocks losing ground as downbeat Chinese economic data added to worries about a global slowdown and rising interest rates.

China's economic activity cooled sharply in April as widening COVID-19 lockdowns took a heavy toll on consumption, industrial production and employment, adding to fears the economy could shrink in the second quarter.

However, energy stocks got a lift from optimism that China would see significant demand recovery after positive signs that coronavirus pandemic was receding in the hardest-hit areas.

The S&P 500 energy index jumped 3.6%, making it the strongest performer among 11 sector indexes.

Investors questioned whether a strong day on Wall Street last Friday might signal the end of a recent sell-off that has left the S&P 500 down about 16% from its record high close in January.

""After the big rally on Friday, people are looking around and asking whether it feels sustainable,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""Does it feel like the momentum thrust you would see coming off of a low, or is there still more of a capitulation to be worked out?""

Wall Street's megacap growth stocks were mostly lower, with Tesla dropping almost 5% and Amazon down 1.2%. Microsoft gained 1.2%.

The S&P 500 healthcare sector index was up 1%, lifted by a 3.3% jump in Eli Lilly & Co after the drugmaker won U.S. approval for tirzepatide, to treat adults with type 2 diabetes.

Investors have been worried that aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve to combat decades-high inflation could tip the economy into a recession, with the conflict in Ukraine, supply chain snarls and the pandemic-related lockdowns in China exacerbating the economic troubles.

Data on Monday showed factory activity in New York state slumped in May for the third time this year amid a collapse in new orders and shipments.

Traders are now pricing a near 86% chance of a 50-basis-point hike by the Fed in June.

In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6% at 32,389.04 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.20% to 4,032.01.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.41% to 11,757.12.

Investors are focused on retail sales data due on Tuesday, following worrying inflation and consumer sentiment data last week.

Retailers including Walmart Inc, Home Depot and Target Corp are due to report their quarterly results this week.

Spirit Airlines jumped 13% after JetBlue Airways launched a hostile takeover bid for the discount carrier. JetBlue shares slipped 4.5%, while shares of rival bidder Frontier Group gained almost 7%.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 31 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 16 new highs and 160 new lows.

* Energy index leads as oil rallies

* Spirit Airlines surges after JetBlue launches hostile takeover (Updates with end of trading session)

By Amruta Khandekar and Noel Randewich

May 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Monday, with energy stocks rallying and Tesla and other growth stocks losing ground after downbeat Chinese economic data added to worries about a global slowdown and rising interest rates.

China's economic activity cooled sharply in April as widening COVID-19 lockdowns took a heavy toll on consumption, industrial production and employment, adding to fears the economy could shrink in the second quarter.

However, energy stocks got a lift from optimism that China would see significant demand recovery after positive signs that coronavirus pandemic was receding in the hardest-hit areas.

The S&P 500 energy index rallied to a 2014 intra-day high, and it was the strongest performer among 11 sector indexes.

Investors questioned whether a strong day on Wall Street last Friday might signal the end of a recent sell-off that has left the S&P 500 down about 16% from its record high close in January.

""After the big rally on Friday, people are looking around and asking whether it feels sustainable,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""Does it feel like the momentum thrust you would see coming off of a low, or is there still more of a capitulation to be worked out?""

Many of Wall Street's megacap growth stocks were lower, with Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet losing ground and weighing on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Twitter extended losses after Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk said a deal to buy the social media company at a lower price than his previously agreed $44 billion was ""not out of the question.""

Tesla, which Musk leads, also fell.

The S&P 500 healthcare sector index rose, lifted by a jump in Eli Lilly & Co after the drugmaker won U.S. approval for tirzepatide, to treat adults with type 2 diabetes.

Investors have been worried that aggressive interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve to combat decades-high inflation could tip the economy into a recession, with the conflict in Ukraine, supply chain snarls and the pandemic-related lockdowns in China exacerbating the economic troubles.

Data on Monday showed factory activity in New York state slumped in May for the third time this year amid a collapse in new orders and shipments.

Traders are now pricing a near 86% chance of a 50-basis-point hike by the Fed in June.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 15.24 points, or 0.38%, to end at 4,008.65 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 140.81 points, or 1.19%, to 11,664.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.07 points, or 0.12%, to 32,235.73.

Investors are focused on retail sales data due on Tuesday, following worrying inflation and consumer sentiment data last week.

Retailers including Walmart Inc, Home Depot and Target Corp are due to report their quarterly results this week.

Spirit Airlines rallied after JetBlue Airways launched a hostile takeover bid for the discount carrier. JetBlue shares slipped, while shares of rival bidder Frontier Group gained.

US stocks are continuing their decline on Monday as investors are reacting negatively to concerns related to growth due to rising inflation that is resulting in the interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. As of 12:51 PM ET, the S&P 500, the Dow 30 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index are down 0.34%, 0.03%, and 1.05%, respectively. Some popular names making the headlines today include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG).

Let’s look at why these stocks are in the spotlight today and discuss how hedge funds are positioned in them.

10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is 0.27% in the green as of 12:41 PM ET after the stock of the Los Gatos, California-based streaming giant was upgraded from a Neutral to an Outperform rating with a price target of $280 by Michael Pachter at Wedbush. The analyst thinks that the release of Stranger Things and Ozark in two halves will reduce the churn rate and increase subscriber growth. Pachter further added that the recent losses incurred by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) are due to its saturation in the US and Canada. To overcome this issue, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is cracking down on password sharing, which will ensure that free riders do not enjoy the company's services. Furthermore, the company is planning to introduce an advertisement-based service to target subscribers who are unwilling to pay the monthly fee.

According to Insider Monkey’s proprietary data, 113 hedge funds held a stake in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) as of Q4 2021.

9. Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) has slumped 6.05% as of 12:45 PM ET after Dan Ives at Wedbush securities highlighted that acquiring the social media microblogging platform for $54.20 per share is not possible under the current circumstances. The stock prices of companies like Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) have come under immense pressure due to valuation concerns following the hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Furthermore, Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) also disclosed fake accounts and automated bots issues during its latest earnings results. Ives thinks Elon Musk's disclosure that he is putting the deal on hold could be a violation of the nondisclosure agreement. The deal has become too complicated to predict whether the richest person in the world would go ahead with it or abandon it.

As of Q4 2021, the number of hedge funds invested in Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) stood at 83. Renaissance Technologies was long over 2 million shares of Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) during Q1 2022.

8. The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is up 1.12% as of 12:48 PM ET after the stock of the Ventura, California-based digital advertisement platform was upgraded to a Buy rating with a price target of $80 by Mark Kelley at Stifel. The target price provides an upside potential of 54.08% from the last closing price. The analyst highlights that the changing dynamic in the digital streaming industry will be a positive catalyst for The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD). The investment firm has rethought its position on the connected TV advertisement companies following the announcement that Netflix will launch its ad-based streaming service by the end of the year, and Disney+ intends to offer a similar service.

Of the 924 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey during Q4 2021, The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) was held by 32 hedge funds.

7. Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) has rocketed 11.07% as of 12:46 PM ET after JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) commenced a hostile takeover attempt of the company. The Miramar, Florida-based low-cost airline carrier declined a $33 per share bid from JetBlue Airways earlier this month in favor of a prior merger agreement with Frontier Airlines. Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) and Frontier think that the merger would help them compete with their peers with fewer challenges. JetBlue has now offered $30 per share and is encouraging Spirit Airlines, Inc.'s (NYSE:SAVE) shareholders to vote against the merger with Frontier Airlines during the annual shareholder meeting on June 10.

Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) was held by 19 hedge funds at the end of Q4 2021. PAR Capital Management was the leading hedge fund investor in Spirit Airlines, Inc. (NYSE:SAVE) during Q1 2022.

6. Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) has plummeted 9.17% as of 12:46 PM ET after the stock of the California-based customer engagement platform was downgraded from an Outperform to a Neutral rating by William Power at Baird. Meanwhile, the target price was cut from $155 to $120, providing a potential upside of 8.31% from the last closing price. Power shared that during the challenging time for the US economy due to high inflation and interest rate hike, he is switching his focus to companies that provide a global platform and are surrounded by strong free cash flow and balance sheets. In his opinion, Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) stock does not meet this criterion. Furthermore, Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) is facing strong competitive forces, challenges in profitability, and the absence of any short-term catalyst.

Out of the 924 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey, 80 funds held a position in Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) as of Q4 2021.

In addition to Twilio, Inc. (NYSE:TWLO), some other trending stocks on Monday include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG).

May 16 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Monday, with Tesla and other growth stocks losing ground after downbeat Chinese economic data added to worries about a global slowdown and rising interest rates.

China's economic activity cooled sharply in April as widening COVID-19 lockdowns took a heavy toll on consumption, industrial production and employment, adding to fears the economy could shrink in the second quarter.

557,Musk Says Twitter Deal at Lower Price Is ‘Not Out of the Question’,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk stoked speculation that he could seek to renegotiate his takeover of Twitter Inc., saying a viable deal at a lower price wouldn’t be “out of the question.”

Twitter shares fell 8.2% at the close of trading in New York. The stock has been dropping on speculation that Musk could walk away from the $44 billion acquisition. That concern has grown in the past week as Musk has questioned Twitter’s publicly disclosed data on the percentage of spam and fake accounts on its social-media service.

Musk pressed further on that front Monday at a Miami tech conference, estimating that fake users make up at least 20% of all Twitter accounts. That was the low end of his estimate on the number of bots on the network, and he asked rhetorically if it could be as high as 90%, according to a livestreamed video of his remarks posted by a Twitter user.

“Currently what I’m being told is that there’s just no way to know the number of bots,” Musk said at the conference. “It’s like, as unknowable as the human soul.”

Twitter declined to comment. The San Francisco-based company reports quarterly that spam accounts make up less than 5% of total users.

Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, last week said his bid to buy Twitter was “temporarily on hold” pending details about how many spam and fake accounts are on the platform. Over the weekend, he tweeted that he planned to do his own analysis of Twitter’s user base by using a random sample of 100 user accounts. Shortly after, Musk claimed that Twitter’s legal team called to complain that he had violated their non-disclosure agreement by publicly sharing the company’s methodology.

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal disputed that on Monday in a tweet thread that offered more details on the company’s approach to spam accounts. Agrawal said Twitter manually checks thousands of accounts every quarter to determine how many should be counted as spam, but added that the process could not be conducted externally because of user privacy concerns.

Agrawal said Twitter “shared an overview of the estimation process with Elon a week ago.” Musk replied to the CEO’s tweet thread by first asking why Twitter doesn’t just call users to verify their identity -- and then by posting a poop emoji.

Musk spoke at a conference hosted by a podcast called “All-In” run by Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks and David Friedberg. The $7,500-per-person event was sold out, and organizers said journalists were excluded from attending. Musk appeared at the Miami summit via videoconference.

The 50-year-old billionaire began buying Twitter shares in January and disclosed a 9.2% stake in the company on April 4. Twitter’s board accepted Musk’s $44 billion bid to buy the company and take it private on April 25, but the deal is months away from closing, and Twitter’s shares are trading far below the offer price.

The spread between Musk’s $54.20-a-share bid and Twitter’s share price continues to widen, wiping out all the gains the stock had made since Elon Musk disclosed his stake in the social media platform.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of BlackRock's Chinese stock picks and market outlook, go directly to BlackRock's Latest Report on China and 5 Stocks to Watch.

New York-based BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with more than $10 trillion in assets under management as of the first quarter of 2022. Founded in 1988, the money-manager now boasts a global footprint, with 70 offices in 30 countries which serve clients in around 100 countries. As a mammoth in its respective field, it's only natural that Wall Street takes notice when BlackRock shares its analysis on a particular situation.

With a solid history of investing in Chinese stocks, BlackRock has now turned bearish on the world's second largest economy. The asset manager cited growing geopolitical concerns, amidst China's close ties to Russia, as well as a deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, as the reason for trimming its outlook from 'Slightly Overweight' to 'Neutral'. Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, told clients in a weekly note:

""China’s ties to Russia also have created a new geopolitical concern that requires more compensation for holding Chinese assets, we think.""

The outbreak of the Omicron wave in China has upended the nation's economic growth, and this effect is exacerbated by the government's 'zero-tolerance' policy to mitigate the spread of the virus. This means entire cities are put under strict lockdowns, and massive testing carried out until the virus is completely weeded out. Shares of Chinese companies have considerably declined since October. BlackRock analysts Jean Boivin and Wei Li, who previously held a 'Modest Overweight' stance on Chinese stocks as their attractive valuations covered for the risks, now believe these lockdowns will significantly hurt the economy. The yuan has declined to an 18-month low against the US dollar, currently hovering at 6.79 yuans per dollar.

Story continues

As a response to this economic instability, Chinese regulators have decided to ease off their clampdown against the country's tech industry, according to the Wall Street Journal. For the last several months, the authorities were hounding big tech names under their vision of 'Common Prosperity', where large corporations making unprecedented profits and enjoying unchallenged monopolies were reformed to put society on a more equal footing. But authorities are planning to hold off on the introduction of new regulations, and are reportedly considering to force tech giants to offer 1% equity stakes to the government and a direct role in corporate decisions. As this news broke in late April, shares of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) rallied, offering the economy some immediate relief.

BlackRock's Latest Report on China and 10 Stocks to Watch

10. JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD)

BlackRock's Stake Value: $237.29 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 67

JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is first up on the list of 10 Chinese stocks to watch in BlackRock's portfolio. As of the end of the first quarter, the world's largest asset manager owned 4.1 million shares of the Chinese firm at a value of $237.3 million. Based in Beijing, JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is an e-commerce giant which deals in online retail marketplaces, services related to the logistics business, as well as property and technology initiatives.

On May 2, Mizuho analyst James Lee maintained a 'Buy' rating on JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) shares and reduced the firm's price target to $90 from $100. Lee notes that the first half of 2022 will be challenging for the Chinese internet sector as Covid restrictions affect consumer spending and business activities. He sees this negative impact spreading across all segments of the internet sector, including cloud computing, e-commerce and advertising. However, the analyst doesn't see Covid as a structural risk, but thinks the zero-tolerance policy in China will only delay the recovery schedule.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 67 out of 924 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held positions in JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) with a combined value of $8.75 billion. This shows a positive trend from the quarter before where 66 hedge funds held stakes in the Chinese firm. At the end of Q1 2022, Fisher Asset Management held a stake worth $445 million in JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), making it the firm's largest shareholder.

On May 4, JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) announced the approval of a special cash dividend of $0.63 per ordinary share, or $1.26 per ADS, to shareholders as of May 20. The total amount paid through this special dividend will stand at around $2 billion.

Argosy Investors, an investment firm, mentioned JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) in its Q3 2021 investor letter, stating:

“We sold JD as a result of the furor over Chinese stocks during the quarter. We had been concerned about China’s lack of respect for investor rights for some time, and Beijing has become significantly more aggressive in asserting itself of late. In addition, the legal structure Chinese companies use to come public in the U.S., a Cayman Islands shell corporation leaves American investors with an unsure path to recovering value should these companies cease to trade on U.S. exchanges. Because of the uncertainty, we exited our position in JD completely. We still love JD’s long-term prospects, but we cannot estimate the legal/regulatory risk associated with these companies anymore. More broadly, we are freeing up cash for some other positions we already own which have declined in this market, and after additional review, remain attractive.”

In addition to Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the most exciting Chinese stocks to watch.

9. Huazhu Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT)

Huazhu Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) is a Chinese firm which deals in the development, ownership and management of hotels throughout Mainland China. Prior to 2018, it was known as China Lodging Group, and currently manages approximately 8,000 hotels under a range of brand names.

As of the end of the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock owned 7.64 million shares of Huazhu Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) with a price tag of $252.24 million.

In comparison, 28 hedge funds were long on the company shares a quarter ago.

For the first two months of 2022, Huazhu Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) reported that it was on track towards recovery in its RevPar (revenue per available room), which stood at 65% of the 2019 level in March 2022, as compared to only 47% of the 2019 level in January 2022. However, the widespread outbreak of Covid in China and the subsequent lockdown measures have halted this recovery as leisure, travelling and business activities take a hit. Nonetheless, some demand for hotel rooms has increased owing to the quarantine needs of infected patients and medical staff.

Credit Suisse analyst Lok Kan Chan on March 24 upgraded Huazhu Group Limited (NASDAQ:HTHT) to 'Outperform' from 'Neutral' and set a price target of HK$33, down from HK$41. The analyst notes that the Covid lockdowns have affected near-term recovery, but the recent price correction gives investors a good buying opportunity given the firm's ongoing network expansion and a potentially better domestic recovery.

8. ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc. (NYSE:ZTO)

BlackRock's Stake Value: $487.07 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 28

Based in Shanghai, ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc. (NYSE:ZTO) offers delivery and value-added logistics services throughout China with a fleet of approximately 11,000 trucks. With 19.48 million shares worth $487 million, the firm represented 0.01% of BlackRock's portfolio at the end of the first quarter of 2022.

Citi analyst Lu Xu on March 18 lowered the firm's price target on ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc. (NYSE:ZTO) to $39.60 from $40.90 and reiterated a 'Buy' rating on the company shares, owing to the firm's attractive valuation and ""defensiveness with better-than-peer cost advantage"". The company estimates that its parcel volume for FY2022 will record a year-on-year increase of 18%-24% as based on the current market conditions and company operations.

For the fourth quarter of 2021, ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc. (NYSE:ZTO) posted an EPS of $0.34, beating estimates by $0.02. Revenue of $1.45 billion for the quarter missed estimates by $62.6 million, but exceeded year-on-year figures by 14.3%.

Out of all the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 28 reported owning stakes in ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc. (NYSE:ZTO) at the close of the fourth quarter with a total value of $1.09 billion.

Yao expects ""early-cycle sectors"" such as digital entertainment, local service, and e-commerce ""to be the first batch of out-performers"". The uncertainties plaguing the Chinese internet sector are abating on the back of recent regulatory announcements, according to the analyst, who now has a more balanced view on the stocks. Mizuho analyst James Lee was also bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in early May, giving the stock a 'Buy' rating and a revised price target of $160 from $180.

96 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) at the close of the fourth quarter, with aggregate holdings worth $6.93 billion. This is down from 115 hedge funds a quarter ago with combined positions worth $10.2 billion in the company. Billionaire and prominent investor Ken Fisher was bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) at the close of the first quarter of 2022, with his Fisher Asset Management holding a $1.57 billion stake in the Chinese giant comprising of 14.44 million shares.

Here is what Baron Funds, an investment firm, had to say about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“We have eliminated 6 holdings during the first quarter (including) Alibaba. We have sold our Alibaba Group Holding Limited position as the company continues to face competitive challenges and regulatory pressures remain, making it difficult (if not impossible) to appropriately assess the range of outcomes and associated probabilities for the future profitability of the business.”

6. XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV)

BlackRock's Stake Value: $557.75 million

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29

Then there's XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV), an electric carmaker headquartered in Guangzhou, China. It makes and sells SUVs under the G3 name, sports sedans under the P7 name, and family sedans under the P5 name. BlackRock, according to its Q1 2022 portfolio, owned a $557.8 million stake in the firm comprising of 20.21 million shares.

On April 1, HSBC analyst Yuqian Ding initiated coverage of XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) with a 'Buy' rating and a $37 price target. The analyst expects the firm's leading and differentiated smart driving experience to boost its sales and brand equity, as it is the only Chinese firm to achieve the impressive feat of building its software for autonomous driving completely in-house, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The analyst sees the firm's product cycle driving rapid volume growth.

XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) announced that it delivered 9,002 smart EVs in April 2022, signaling a 75% increase year-over-year. However, this was a 42% drop from the previous month on the back of supply chain and other issues related to the Covid lockdowns. Year-to-date deliveries stood at 43,563 as of April 30, representing a 136% jump from the year-ago figure.

Of the 900+ elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the close of the fourth quarter of 2021, 29 held positions in XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) with a collective price tag of $1.17 billion. This is a positive trend from the previous quarter where 25 hedge funds held $657 million worth of stakes in the EV maker.

Just like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), JD.Com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) is a Chinese stock on the radar of investors.

560,Musk Sees US as ‘Probably’ in Recession Lasting Up to 18 Months,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk said that the US economy was “probably” in a recession -- a judgment at odds with economists and available data -- and cautioned companies to watch costs and cash flows.

“These things pass and then there will be boom times again,” Musk told the All-In Summit in Miami Beach, according to a live-streamed video of his remarks posted by a Twitter user. “It’ll probably be some tough-going for, I don’t know, a year, maybe 12-18 months.”

Recession fears have been growing recently as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to help cool down inflation that’s running near its hottest pace since the early 1980s. Still, odds of downturn in the coming year currently stand at 30%, according the latest Bloomberg monthly survey of economists.

While the US economy shrank an annualized 1.4% in the first quarter, the weakness was primarily due to a record trade deficit. Measures of demand -- consumer spending and business investment in equipment -- actually quickened at the start of 2022. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow estimate currently has second-quarter gross domestic product rising at a 1.8% pace.

Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, made the comments on the economy and politics as part of a wide-ranging video appearance at the technology conference. He’s in the middle of a $44 billion takeover attempt to buy Twitter Inc. and is pushing that social-media company for more details about of many of its claimed users are actually bots.

Musk suggested that recessions aren’t necessarily a bad thing, adding that he’s been through a few of them in his time at public companies.

“What tends to happen is, if you have a boom that goes on for too long, you get misallocation of capital -- it starts raining money on fools, basically,” he said.

Musk, when asked about recent comments about inflation made by fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, said the rising prices had resulted from simply money printing. Musk and Bezos are, respectively, the No. 1 and No. 2 richest people in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

“The honest reason for inflation is that the government printed a zillion amount of more money than it had,” Musk said, adding that countries including Venezuela had already been down the same path. “This is not like, you know, super complicated.”

Musk said he’s a moderate who has “overwhelmingly” voted with Democrats in the past, but he’s no fan of the administration of US President Joe Biden. He’s chided the Democratic president previously for downplaying Tesla’s role in the movement toward electric vehicles.

“This administration, just, it doesn’t seem to get a lot done,” Musk said, adding that he thought immigration policy needed to be addressed. “It’s incredibly important that the United States be like the destination for the world’s best talent.”

While Musk said he “might never” have voted for a Republican previously, he said he could change his mind in the next election.

The billionaire tweeted “this deal cannot move forward” unless Twitter provides proof of claims that less than 5% of its users are bots, reiterating his own view that the ratio is far higher.

Musk shocked the market last week when he tweeted that his offer to buy Twitter was “temporarily on hold” until he receives more information about the proportion of fake accounts on the social media site. The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer linked his tweet to a May 2 Reuters report on Twitter’s most recent disclosure about the number of bots on the platform. Roughly two hours later, Musk then claimed in another tweet that he was “still committed” to the deal.

Doubts have grown that Musk would be able to pull off his acquisition, and that he may consider dropping his bidding price for the micro-blogging site. The whole transaction has been chaotic with Musk going from a prolific user to revealing a stake of more than 9% in the company, then launching an unsolicited takeover offer -- without detailed financing plans -- within a matter of weeks.

570,"Twitter deal is dead without proof of fake accounts, warns Elon Musk","A screen shows the logo of Twitter on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, New York, USA, 16 May 2022 - JUSTIN LANE/EPA-EFE/ Shutterstock

Elon Musk has threatened to pull out of his $44bn (£35bn) takeover of Twitter unless the social network can prove claims that one in 20 accounts are fake.

The Tesla billionaire said “this deal cannot move forward” until Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief executive, shows proof of its claims that under 5pc of accounts are spam or fake.

“My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC [US Securities and Exchange Commission] filings being accurate,” Mr Musk wrote on Twitter.

“Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5pc. This deal cannot move forward until he does.”

20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.

This deal cannot move forward until he does.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2022

He later responded to a tweet suggesting the number of fake accounts could be over 50pc, saying “exactly”.

Twitter has consistently said since 2014 that it estimates fewer than 5pc of its 229m daily users are fake accounts.

Mr Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, has claimed that the true proportion of illegitimate accounts is much higher and said last week that the deal was “on hold” pending more details from the company.

His intervention has widely been perceived as a negotiating tactic to drive down the price of Twitter or back out of the deal. Mr Musk said on Monday that he could end up paying a lower price than his $54.20 a share bid.

Twitter’s shares have slumped since Mr Musk’s announcement on Friday, falling 17pc in two days of trading to $37.39 - more than 30pc below the offer price.

On Monday, Mr Agrawal said the company suspends over half a million spam accounts daily, and that they made “well under” 5pc, but that the company could not share private information on how it calculates this.

Mr Musk responded, saying: “So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter.”

The deal to acquire Twitter is largely being financed by Mr Musk himself, including $12.5bn of loans secured against his Tesla shares, also includes Oracle tycoon Larry Ellison, cryptocurrency exchange Binance, and Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal.",2022-05-17T09:11:31+00:00
571,Tesla stock pops as Elon Musk hints he could scrap Twitter deal,"No Twitter (TWTR) deal for Elon Musk would mean more love and attention for his prized asset Tesla (TSLA) — at least that's how investors are reading it on Tuesday.

Shares of Tesla popped 4% in pre-market trading as Musk's deal for Twitter was thrown into fresh doubt after he suggested that the social media site has more fake accounts than the less than 5% that it has disclosed in securities filings.

In an early morning Tweet, Musk said “Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%,"" adding that “this deal cannot move forward until he does.""

Twitter shares fell 3%.

Tesla's stock has dropped 34% since Musk revealed a 9.2% stake in Twitter in early April, likely reflecting investors' concern that the buyout saga is diverting Musk's attention from the EV maker's operations and future.

Since revealing that stake, Musk has behaved in typically erratic fashion. He first disclosed himself as a passive investor before pivoting to become an active one; he initially agreed to be on the board but changed his mind on that front, too. And since reaching a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion on April 25, the CEO has repeatedly shown signs he's having second thoughts.

The new tweet from Musk arrives after a tense exchange on the social media platform on Monday.

20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.

Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2022

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal wrote a long tweet thread to try to counter Musk's claims the platform was chock full of fake accounts.

""We suspend over half a million spam accounts every day, usually before any of you even see them on Twitter,"" Agrawal said in the 13-tweet thread. ""We also lock millions of accounts each week that we suspect may be spam — if they can’t pass human verification challenges (captchas, phone verification, etc).""

Story continues

Musk responded with a poop emoji.

Musk, the world's richest person on paper, then followed up 14 minutes later with: ""So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter.""

Amid the uncertainty, Twitter shares have now given back all their gains since Musk disclosed his stake. Twitter shares currently trade at $36.30 based on pre-market levels Tuesday, below the $39.31 closing price hit prior to his stake being revealed.

Wall Street analyst believe the saga is weighing heavily on employee morale at Twitter, and its fundamentals.

""I can't imagine [being an employee there]; it's like living in a washing machine right now — you are in the spin cycle,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above) earlier on Monday. ""We have seen senior executives leave. Companies we cover in the tech industry have hired executives out [of Twitter]. I think you are seeing execs check out — they don't want to be in for the spin cycle. This will only make things worse.""

Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter (TWTR) has hit another speed bump amid concerns over spam accounts on the platform.

The billionaire tweeted that the agreement “cannot go forward” unless the company can show that less than 5% of accounts on the site are fake or spam.

He said his $44bn (£36bn) offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate, but that Parag Agrawal, chief executive of the platform, publicly refused to show proof that spam profiles account for less than 5%.

“This deal cannot move forward until he does,” Musk said. He suggested that the figure was closer to 20%, four times what Twitter has claimed, adding that it “could be much higher”.

“I’m still waiting for some sort of logical explanation for the number of fake or spam accounts on Twitter. And Twitter is refusing to tell us. This seems like a strange thing,” he told the Financial Times.

Agrawal responded with a series of tweets.

“Let’s talk about spam. And let’s do so with the benefit of data, facts, and context… First, let me state the obvious: spam harms the experience for real people on Twitter, and therefore can harm our business.

“As such, we are strongly incentivised to detect and remove as much spam as we possibly can, every single day. Anyone who suggests otherwise is just wrong.”

He added: “We suspend over half a million spam accounts every day, usually before any of you even see them on Twitter. We also lock millions of accounts each week that we suspect may be spam – if they can’t pass human verification challenges (captchas, phone verification, etc).”

Twitter shares fell 8% on Monday in New York, and are down 2.8% in pre-market trading at the time of writing. They are already around 30% lower than the $54.20 a share that Musk has agreed to pay.

Traders are now fearful that the deal may not go through at the original price, and possibly may be forfeited altogether. Musk will face a $1bn break-up fee if he walks away.

But Twitter has said it is committed to completing the takeover at the agreed terms and price. The company issued a statement saying the deal was subject to the approval of Twitter stockholders and is expected to close in 2022.

“In true Elon Musk style, this deal continues to take a series of unexpected twists and turns, keeping investors on their toes,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor said.

“The stock is now trading more than 30% below his $54.30 offer, suggesting that confidence in the deal crossing the line is fading fast. It looks like these spam accounts are creating a convenient excuse for Musk either to walk away or to at least negotiate a better price.

“Remember Twitter was relatively quick to accept Musk’s first offer. Perhaps Musk now thinks he shot too high, particularly given the recent sharp slump in Tesla’s share price since the deal materialised.”

Tesla Stock Rebounds After Musk Says He Needs Proof That Fake/Spam Accounts Are Less Than 5% Of Twitter Users

Shares of Tesla gained upside momentum in premarket trading after Elon Musk tweeted that his offer to buy Twitter was based on the assumption that Twitter‘s SEC filings on the number of fake/spam accounts were accurate.

He also noted that Twitter’s CEO refused to show proof that fake/spam accounts were less than 5% of the total account number. Musk added that the deal could not move forward until he sees proof of Twitter’s statements.

Traders are trying to guess whether Musk is trying to walk away from the deal without paying the breakup fee or trying to negotiate a better price.

Both scenarios are bearish for Twitter stock, so it’s not surprising to see that Twitter is losing ground in premarket trading.

For Tesla stock, the recent news is bullish. Traders are worried that Musk will have to sell more Tesla stock to finance the deal, so a lower priced deal or a full collapse of the deal would serve as bullish catalysts.

What’s Next For Tesla Stock?

There are two main catalysts for Tesla in the near term. The first catalyst is the fate of the Twitter deal. If the deal is scrapped, traders will have no worries about potential stock sales from Musk, which will provide more support to Tesla shares.

The second catalyst is the situation with coronavirus in China, which has already put pressure on both production and demand for Tesla cars. At this point, it looks that developments in China could serve as a bigger catalyst for the stock, so traders will need to keep a close eye on the country in the upcoming weeks.

It should be noted that Tesla’s valuation has recently declined to more attractive levels, so the stock may be sensitive to positive catalysts. In this light, Tesla will have a good chance to gain additional upside momentum in case Twitter deal continues to fall apart.

The key relationships in the run-up to Musk’s takeover offer revolve around calls with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and board member Egon Durban, managing partner at private equity firm Silver Lake who helped Musk on his ill-fated 2018 attempt to take Tesla Inc. private, according to a US securities filing on Tuesday.

During the course of March 26, Musk chatted to Dorsey and Durban about his plans for the social media platform, including that he had taken a “significant stake” of more than 5% stake in the company.

Durban soon informed Bret Taylor, the board chairman, Martha Lane Fox, one of Twitter’s directors, and Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal, of Musk’s interest in joining the board and set up a meeting between Musk and the Twitter executives.

Many of the following twists in the Twitter takeover have been highly publicized by Musk, on Twitter -- his financing, his concerns over bots, even poop emojis to Agrawal. However, the latest details highlight how the troubled takeover has appeared to be been driven by the billionaire’s whims rather than deep financial analysis.

In early April, after the initial conversations with Musk, it seemed Twitter’s board and its legal team had successfully sated his appetite to change the company. Musk agreed to take a board seat, limit his stake in Twitter to 14.9%, and spent three days chatting about new products with Agrawal -- presumably including adding an edit button.

By now Dorsey had informed the Twitter board of the somewhat obvious fact that “that he and Mr. Musk were friends,’ according to the filing. The pair, two of the tech industry’s most high-profile entrepreneurs, have regularly chatted about cryptocurrencies and making Twitter’s software and content moderation decisions more transparent.

Durban also told the board that he had worked on “unrelated matters with Mr. Musk in the past.” These matters involved advice given by Silver Lake -- along with other investors -- in 2018 over taking Tesla private. The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk for securities fraud, after he falsely claimed -- via Twitter -- he had funding to take Tesla private.

On April 4, Musk publicly disclosed his 9.2% stake in Twitter and board members outlined their offer for him to have a seat at the table, subject to him agreeing to not acquire more than 14.9% of the company. Meanwhile, Musk continued to discuss Twitter’s strategy with Dorsey and Agrawal. Dorsey shared his own view that Twitter would do better as a private company, and that he would not stay on as a board member with Musk.

Musk’s conversation with Dorsey clearly outweighed any potential product launch with Agrawal. On April 9, Musk decided he wanted to buy Twitter instead. He made his formal offer of $54.20 a share on April 14, setting off a scramble to finance the deal.

Since then, Musk’s takeover attempt of Twitter has been one of general chaos, most recently culminating in Musk declaring Tuesday morning that he won’t proceed unless the social media giant can prove bots make up fewer than 5% of its users.

Wall Street has always been skeptical of the deal. The spread between Musk’s offer and Twitter’s last trading price is currently about 40%, suggesting investors think there is little chance the deal will get done without a discount -- if at all.

There is unlikely to be a white knight to push the price back up. In mid-April a number of financial sponsors and institutional investors got in touch with Twitter’s advisers that they might be interested in either buying or funding a deal for Twitter. However, “None of these parties (or any other party) made a proposal to acquire Twitter,” according to the filing.

582,"Tesla cars, Bluetooth locks, vulnerable to hackers - researchers","LONDON (Reuters) - Millions of digital locks worldwide, including on Tesla cars, can be remotely unlocked by hackers exploiting a vulnerability in Bluetooth technology, a cybersecurity firm said on Tuesday.

In a video shared with Reuters, NCC Group researcher Sultan Qasim Khan was able to open and then drive a Tesla using a small relay device attached to a laptop which bridged a large gap between the Tesla and the Tesla owner's phone.

""This proves that any product relying on a trusted BLE connection is vulnerable to attacks even from the other side of the world,"" the UK-based firm said in a statement, referring to the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol - technology used in millions of cars and smart locks which automatically open when in close proximity to an authorised device.

Although Khan demonstrated the hack on a 2021 Tesla Model Y, NCC Group said any smart locks using BLE technology, including residential smart locks, could be unlocked in the same way.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

NCC Group said such a vulnerability was not like a traditional bug which could be fixed with a software patch and added BLE-based authentication was not originally designed for use in locking mechanisms.

""In effect, systems that people rely on to guard their cars, homes and private data are using Bluetooth proximity authentication mechanisms that can be easily broken with cheap off-the-shelf hardware,"" the firm said.

""This research illustrates the danger of using technologies for reasons other than their intended purpose, especially when security issues are involved"".

583,"Stock Market News for May 17, 2022","U.S. stocks ended mostly lower on Monday with the S&P 500 giving up all its day’s gains in the final hour of trading, as weak data from China and the United States added to the worries of rising interest rates and a global economic slowdown. The Dow somehow managed to end in positive territory, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed in the red.

How Did The Benchmarks Perform?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) added less than 0.1% or 26.27 points to close at 32,223.42 points.

The S&P 500 fell 0.4% or 15.88 points to finish at 4,008.01 points. The index has now closed in the red in six of the past eight sessions. Consumer discretionary, technology and real estate stocks were the biggest losers.

The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) lost 2.2% and 0.8%, respectively. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) fell 0.9%. However, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) added 2.6%. Seven of the 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 1.2% or 142.21 points to end at 11,662.79 points. The index is now 27% down from its record close of 16,057.44 points recorded on Nov 19, 2021.

The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 4.85% to 27.47. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. A total of 11.3 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 13.2 billion.

Concerns Over Economic Slowdown Grows

The Dow and the S&P 500 gave up almost all the gains in the final hours of trading on Monday. Markets ended last week in the green but the upbeat sentiment faded on Monday once again on worries about rising interest rates, global economic slowdown and surging inflation.

Investors are now skeptical that the Fed can check inflation without the economy getting pushed into recession. Treasury yields have risen this year as the Fed continues to tighten its monetary policy to check inflation. The 10-year Treasury yield that started the year at around 1.5% has since risen sharply. On Monday, it closed just below 2.9% after briefly eclipsing the 3% mark it had hit earlier this month.

Story continues

This saw the already beaten-down tech stocks once again taking a hit on Monday. Tech stocks have been suffering since the beginning of the year and Monday was no different. Shares of Datadog, Inc. DDOG and Atlassian Corporation Plc TEAM plummeted 10.7% and 6.3% respectively, while electric vehicle company Tesla, Inc. TSLA declined 5.9%. Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Weak Data from China

If the existing concerns were not enough, fresh data and reports revealed that economic activity is being hampered in China owing to the recent COVID-induced lockdowns. This further raised concern for investors, weighing on the broader market.

Meanwhile, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned that the United States may be entering stagflation for the first time since the 1970s, which further raised concerns among investors.

Economic Data

Weak economic data weighed on the markets at the beginning of the week. The New York Fed’s Empire State business conditions index that measures the manufacturing activity in the state, fell to a negative 11.6 in May after declining as much as 36.2 points. Economists had projected a marginal decline and had expected the index to remain at 16.5. A reading below zero means deteriorating conditions.

584,10 Biggest Losers in Cathie Wood’s Latest Portfolio,"In this article, we discuss the 10 biggest losers in Cathie Wood's latest portfolio. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Wood's hedge fund performance, history and stock selection, go directly to 5 Biggest Losers in Cathie Wood's Latest Portfolio.

Cathie Wood became a superstar money-manager in 2020, the very year stock markets around the globe saw billions wiped off their valuations. Her hedge fund ARK Investment Management returned 170% in the year, powered by visionary bets placed on what later became known as pandemic stocks such as Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) and Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC).

Her philosophy revolves around 'disruptive tech', which are basically technologies with the potential to change the modern world and its relationship with tech as we know it. Just like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) transformed social media, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) revolutionized smartphones and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) changed the electric vehicles (EV) industry, Cathie Wood is on the constant lookout for companies producing groundbreaking technology that is only a few years away from dominating the global scene. Wood is particularly bullish on certain areas of the tech industry, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, robotics, energy storage and DNA sequencing.

But it takes some guts to have a long-term bullish view for technology people don't presently understand, or see generating a lot of money. And it takes even more to put a lot of money towards these ideas deemed 'far-fetched' by critics.

After a blockbuster 2020, the markets punished Cathie Wood for her views, and her flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) has tanked around 60% in the last 12 months. This was because global inflation, hovering near all-time highs, coupled with soaring energy prices led to investors losing their appetite for risky, growth stocks. But Cathie Wood doesn't share the market's pessimism, and instead doubled down on her bets, increasing her stakes in the stocks that were brutally beaten down by the market. She says that her stock picks are in 'deep value territory', and over a five-year investment horizon, her strategy could post 30-40% compound annual rate of return.

ARK Investment Management’s 13 Portfolio: 1.17% ARK Investment Management’s Stake Value: $281.72 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Year-To-Date Share Price Loss : 66.59%

Then there's 'Metaverse' stock Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), which has lost around 66% in the year to date. The California-based firm offers an online platform where users can create and explore 3D worlds. Cathie Wood, according to her Q1 2022 portfolio, owned 6.09 million shares of Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) at a value of $281 million, representing 1.17% of her total portfolio.

Needham analyst Bernie McTernan on May 12 lowered the firm's price target on Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) to $40 from $60 and maintained a 'Buy' rating on the company shares. Despite the Q1 earnings miss, the analyst is positive on the company leaning into monetization opportunities on its platform as it looks to convert engagement to bookings.

Popular hedge funds held major stakes in Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. In total, 61 hedge funds were long on the company shares, as compared to 50 hedge funds a quarter ago.

8. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)

ARK Investment Management’s 13 Portfolio: 1.31% ARK Investment Management’s Stake Value: $315.05 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Year-To-Date Share Price Loss : 68.55%

Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) provides digital financial services, e-commerce and digital entertainment services in Latin America, Asia and around the world. The Singapore-based company runs ShopeePay, SPayLater, and SeaBank, through which it offers payment processing and digital bank services. It also operates the e-commerce platform Shopee.

As of May 16, shares of Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) have lost 68.15% in the year to date, and 31.13% in the last month. But Cathie Wood decided to increase her stake in the firm by 302%, coming in at 2.63 million shares valued at $315 million at the end of the first quarter of 2022.

On May 4, HSBC analyst Piyush Choudhary reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating on Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) shares and revised the price target to $145 from $150. The analyst sees the firm’s adjusted revenue growing 32% year-over-year in Q1 and expects Shopee’s gross merchandise volume (GMV) to jump 40% in comparison to last year.

In total, investors decreased their holdings in Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) at the close of Q4 2021, with 108 hedge funds holding stakes in the firm as compared to 117 hedge funds a quarter ago. The aggregate value of Q4 hedge fund positions in the firm stood at $10.05 billion.

Investment firm Farrer Wealth Advisors talked about Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. The fund said:

“Sea Limited had been selling off since its peak in early November of ~$363/share. This was driven by both a general sell off in tech, especially non-profitable tech, and a general belief that its gaming arm (Garena) was experiencing a slowdown due to its flagship game Free Fire. Free Fire has experienced a slowdown for three reasons: it is a victim of its own success, and by the end of Q321, nearly 10% of the world’s population already played the game, and thus reaching new users was difficult; A return to normal with people traveling/going out more and spending less time playing games; and the Indian market imposed a ban on the game due to anti-Chinese sentiment (Tencent is a large shareholder in Sea). We believed that these issues, while worth considering, were a bit overblown, and some of the data we saw from 3rd party sources showed that though Free Fire usage was dipping, it wasn’t too drastic. Thus, we marginally added to the position throughout the quarter. This was a mistake. During Sea’s earnings report in early March, the company guidance for Garena (down nearly 35% yoy) showed that the slowdown was far worse than predicted. Secondly, Shopee (Sea’s ecommerce arm) has pulled out of certain markets (in Europe and India), which long-term is probably the right strategy, but short-term hampers the optionality of the business. After considering this information and the guidance from earnings, we decided to significantly trim the position. In our opinion, management does have a bit of egg on its face from an overly aggressive expansion or as one investor called it, “bull market hubris.” We think management’s moves were mostly logical, it’s just that their failures came during an unforgiving market. While we believe that Sea’s future is still bright (especially with regards to their e-commerce and financial services), it will take a few quarters of strong earnings for them to regain their momentum, and for now the capital can be better spent elsewhere.”

7. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)

ARK Investment Management’s 13 Portfolio: 2.54% ARK Investment Management’s Stake Value: $610.43 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Year-To-Date Share Price Loss : 73.22%

Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a Canadian e-commerce company which offers merchants a cloud-based platform to run their businesses across all sales channels, by managing products, inventory, as well as order and payment processing. ARK Investment Management in its Q1 2022 regulatory filings reported owning roughly 903,000 shares of Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) with a price tag of $610.4 million.

On May 6, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian kept an 'Outperform' rating on Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) shares and revised the price target to $630 from $1000. The analyst noted that the firm's below-expectations results were not a big surprise given weakening e-commerce trends observed since mid-February. He sees attractive long-term opportunities for Shopify across e-commerce, payments, software and fulfilment, but notes near-term headwinds in the macro environment amid shifting consumer spending patterns.

For the first quarter of 2022, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) posted EPS of $0.20, falling below estimates by $0.45. The company raked in $1.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, underperforming estimates by $38.2 million.

Investors were seen piling into Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP). At the close of Q4 2021, 86 hedge funds reported owning stakes in the firm, with a combined value of $12.01 billion. This is in comparison to 73 hedge funds a quarter ago.

Here is what investment firm Baron Funds had to say about Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“Shopify Inc. is a cloud-based software provider offering an operating system for multi-channel commerce. Shopify has been adopted by over two million merchants who processed $175 billion of gross merchandise volume in 2021, making it the second largest e-commerce player in the U.S. The stock corrected sharply in the first quarter, declining 51%, as a result of investor rotation out of fast-growing, long-duration stocks and after the company released quarterly results, expecting a normalization in the rapid growth it has experienced during the early stages of the pandemic. We remain shareholders as we believe Shopify has a long runway for growth addressing less than 1% of global commerce spending with a unique and competitively advantaged platform.”

6. Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA)

ARK Investment Management’s 13 Portfolio: 2.72% ARK Investment Management’s Stake Value: $652.65 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Year-To-Date Share Price Loss : 60.19%

On May 9, Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson gave Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) an unchanged rating of 'Outperform', and lowered the price target to $130 from $160. The analyst is ""encouraged"" by the firm's emerging profile of drugs, which he believes supports curative potential.

Reporting its first quarter earnings on May 5, Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) posted quarterly revenue of $11.3 million, beating estimates by $2.7 million and showing an increase of 74.58% from the year-ago quarter. However, EPS came in at -$1.96, missing consensus estimates by $0.85.

Investment firm Carillon Tower Advisers talked about many stocks in its Q2 2021 investor letter, and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) was one of them. The fund said:

“Intellia Therapeutics is a clinical-stage genome editing company focused on the development of proprietary, potentially curative therapeutics. The company’s stock soared after announcing positive interim data from an ongoing phase 1 clinical study of its in vivo gene editing candidate, which is being developed as a single-dose treatment for hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. This specific form of therapy would be the first of its kind resulting in the precision editing of a gene in a target tissue in the human body.”

Along with Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC), and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) is a stock to consider for investors looking to emulate Cathie Wood.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk: “Robotaxi Next Massive Driver of Growth”
“We ramped production with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months. With two fantastic factories with great teams, they are ramping rapidly. With new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially. So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories. We expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year. We’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi. That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals. And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting. That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything. I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024.I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth. And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year…”

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk: “Robotaxi Next Massive Driver of Growth”
“We ramped production with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months. With two fantastic factories with great teams, they are ramping rapidly. With new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially. So, I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories. We expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year. We’re also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated robotaxi. That’s highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals. And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting. That is fundamentally optimized for -- trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything. I think, going to be a very powerful product where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024.I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla’s growth. And we remain on track to reach volume production of the Cybertruck next year…”

591,Twitter’s Board Recommends Shareholders Vote to Approve Musk Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc.’s board unanimously recommended that shareholders approve Elon Musk’s bid to take the social media company private in a $44 billion deal, eight days before they are scheduled to vote and as the billionaire entrepreneur seems to be seeking to back out or renegotiate his offer.

On Monday, Musk has floated the idea of trying to lower his initial offer of $54.20 a share, saying a deal at a lower price wouldn’t be “out of the question.” The billionaire entrepreneur is raising doubts about Twitter’s publicly disclosed data on the percentage of spam and fake accounts on its social-media service, claiming they make up more than 20% of all users. On Tuesday, Musk said he would only go ahead with his offer if Twitter can prove the number is less than the 5% the social media company has reported.

In its proxy statement, Twitter said it’s “committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.”

The board disclosed all relevant details related to Musk’s offer, including how he intends to finance the purchase, the behind the scenes events between the billionaire entrepreneur and Twitter’s executive leadership that led to the offer, and what will happen to shares held by Twitter’s employees and executives if the offer is finalized.

The board cited a host of factors that influenced its decision to recommend that shareholders approve the deal, including an improvement in Twitter’s competitive positioning and prospects if it were to become an independent company, and the board’s belief that the deal has a high level of closing certainty. The board also listed several risks associated with Twitter’s business model if it were to remain a public company such as the challenge of “making investments, operational changes and improvements (including meaningful cost reductions) to achieve long-term growth and profitability” and “the historical challenges to Twitter’s ability to grow its advertising revenue.” The filing went on to say that none of the possible strategic alternatives to the merger was likely to present better opportunities for Twitter to create greater value for its stockholders.

Story continues

The US Securities and Exchange Commission will review the deal -- although the regulatory agency generally lacks the power to stop corporate mergers or take-private transactions -- and shareholders will vote on approval at Twitter’s annual shareholder meeting on May 25. The proxy statement is critical to persuading Twitter’s shareholders to vote yes as it provides significantly more information than was previously available.

US antitrust regulators are also expected to probe Musk’s purchase of Twitter, but they are unlikely to sue to block it because Musk, who is chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., is a nascent entrant into the social media sector.

Twitter told its employees on April 25 that the deal is slated to close in another three to six months.

But Musk created an air of uncertainty last Friday with an early morning tweet that said the deal to take Twitter private was “temporarily on hold” until he receives more information about the proportion of fake accounts on the social media site, linking to a May 2 Reuters report on Twitter’s most recent disclosure about the number of bots on the platform.

Despite his public comments, the deal’s contract doesn’t seem to give Musk much room to walk away. The merger agreement stipulates that he would owe Twitter a $1 billion breakup fee if he were to cancel the deal. The contract also gives Twitter the right to force Musk to close the deal as long as his debt financing is available. Twitter also has the right to go to court to force Musk to try to obtain that debt financing.

Twitter’s stock has been dropping on speculation that the deal falls apart. The stock now sits 31% below the price Musk has contractually agreed to pay, closing Monday at its lowest level since March 17.

Referring to Twitter's previous claim that only about 5% of its accounts are fraudulent or spam, Musk tweeted early this morning that his offer to buy Twitter was dependent on the company's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings being correct.",2022-05-17T14:51:50+00:00

597,Tesla (TSLA) Delays Shanghai Gigafactory Ramp Up to Next Week,"Tesla Inc. TSLA recently announced that it will be delaying the ramp-up of its Shanghai Gigafactory to pre-shutdown production levels as it continues to remain on one closed-loop shift for at least another week. The delay will likely result in a shortage of around 10,000 vehicles produced in the quarter.

Due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China and stringent lockdowns in the first quarter, Tesla was forced to shut down production at its Shanghai factory last month.

The automaker was finally able to restart production on Apr 19 after a 22-day hiatus.

Tesla had brought back around 8,000 people to work in a closed-loop shift to help limit worker movements in the city. Recent reports suggest that the electronic vehicle maker was to increase the facility’s output to 2,600 units per day, close to its pace, before implementing the new set of lockdowns, which had been intended to be accomplished by adding another shift of workers starting May 16.

However, it has been reported that the plan has been postponed to at least May 23 on account of challenges pertaining to the sleeping accommodation for the factory’s incoming second shift of workers.

Now it plans to stick to one shift for the plant for the current week with a daily output of around 1,200 units and stated that it would now aim to increase output to 2,600 units per day from May 23.

Many businesses in Shanghai are allowed to re-open if they can make provisions for a closed-loop system where workers eat and sleep at the factories to limit exposure to the virus. So for Tesla to introduce another shift would call for the accommodation of a thousand more employees at the factory, which might turn out less feasible.

Apart from this, Tesla continues to battle supply issues as it relies on other local Shanghai suppliers operating under the same conditions.

The market is yet to get a full measure of the impact that the Gigafactory shutdown will have on the auto giant’s second-quarter capacity.

Shares of TSLA have gained 25.3% over the past year against its industry’s 4.9% decline.

598,Cathie Wood’s Latest Portfolio: 10 Stocks Under $10,"In this article, we discuss 10 stocks under $10 in Cathie Wood's latest portfolio. If you want to read about some more stocks in the Wood portfolio, go directly to Cathie Wood's Latest Portfolio: 5 Stocks Under $10.

Growth investors like Cathie Wood of ARK Investment Management have not had a good start to the year. The fortunes of ARK Innovation ETF, the flagship fund offered by the hedge fund, have slid dramatically since the beginning of 2022 as inflation rises and the Fed increases interest rates to keep soaring prices under control, pushing investors away from risky offerings. Since January 2022, ARK Innovation ETF has fallen by 56%, with 10% of this decline coming in a single day last week. Wood seems unfazed by the drop.

The famous investor, who was one of the best-performing hedge fund managers of the pandemic-ravaged 2020, has doubled down on her bets on growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) in the past few months, using the phrase “deep value territory” to justify her buying spree. The inflows into her fund have also continued to grow. So far in 2022, the net inflows into her fund stand at around $1.5 billion despite the fact that the short interest on it is near 15%.

Nate Geraci, the president of The ETF Store, an advisory firm, told Bloomberg on May 14 that the decision of Wood to stick with disruptive tech during this turmoil would ultimately end up improving the “long-term visibility” of her fund. Geraci termed the decision “attractive to a certain segment of investors”. The portfolio value of her hedge fund has fallen by about $10 billion in the last three months. During these months, Wood has been busy buying up stocks at bargain prices, some of which are cheaper than $10 per share.

Our Methodology

These were listed according to the investment portfolio of ARK Investment Management at the end of the first quarter of 2022. Only equities which were trading at below $10 per share, as of May 16, were selected. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in Q4 2021 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.

Our appraisal of Kodak’s value surged 12% last quarter up to $10/share due to strong pricing in the printing plates and film segments. Kodak’s new chemical-free Sonora plate business grew 35% and is much more environmentally sustainable than the competition. Digital Printing, a razor/razor blades annuity business, approached breakeven, while Kodak’s next generation Prosper product line grew 17%.

The world’s largest hedge fund led by billionaire Ray Dalio has parted ways with its stake in Tesla (TSLA) and placed new bets on meme-stocks AMC (AMC) and GameStop (GME) during the first quarter, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed. The firm also took new positions in Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) and Airbnb (ABNB).

Earlier regulatory reports by Bridgewater indicated the hedge fund owned 25,488 shares of Elon Musk’s Tesla as of the end of last year.

But the electric-vehicle maker was not listed in the outline of holdings through the period ended March 31, signaling a full exit by the firm from Tesla during the quarter. Before cashing out, previous trade reports showed Bridgewater held Tesla stock during all of 2021.

Bridgewater also reported snapping up 4,136 shares of retail-investor favorite GameStop valued at $689 million during the three-month period, and 27,066 shares of fellow meme-stock AMC totaling $667 million.

The hedge fund has not owned GameStop since March 2018, while the purchase of AMC marks its first foray into the movie theater giant, according to regulatory disclosures.

The firm’s exit from Tesla comes during a challenging period for the stock amid a broader rout in technology and hyper-growth names.

Shares of Tesla capped last quarter in positive territory, up 1.97% at a close of $1,077.60 per share on March 31, but shares are down nearly 40% year-to-date despite reporting solid first-quarter performance. Bridgewater’s sale of Tesla stock came before CEO Musk’s closely-watched pursuit of a deal to acquire social media platform Twitter.

Although the stocks are down on the year, recent rallies in GameStop and AMC even amid a broader sell-off in risk assets have shown traders are still betting on the meme-stock frenzy. GameStop is down about 40% in 2022, while AMC stock is down roughly 60%.

The transaction report also showed Bridgewater took a new stake in insurance and investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, as well as a new position in Airbnb.

600,"If Elon Musk scraps Twitter deal, here's what may happen to the stock","Twitter investors should brace for an all-out crash in the stock price if Tesla CEO Elon Musk abandons his bid for the social media platform, warns one veteran tech analyst.

""In the absence of a bid, we would not be surprised to see the stock find a floor at $22.50,"" said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said Tuesday in a new note to clients. Such a price would be about 40% lower than Twitter's current trading level.

Musk's outstanding deal for Twitter is for $54.20 a share.

The path is being cut for that price put forth by Thill for Twitter shares, by Musk's own doing.

In an early morning Tweet, Musk said “Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%,"" adding that “this deal cannot move forward until he does.""

The new tweet from Musk arrives after a tense exchange on the social media platform on Monday.

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal wrote a long tweet thread to try to counter Musk's claims the platform was chock full of fake accounts.

""We suspend over half a million spam accounts every day, usually before any of you even see them on Twitter,"" Agrawal said in the 13-tweet thread. ""We also lock millions of accounts each week that we suspect may be spam — if they can’t pass human verification challenges (captchas, phone verification, etc).""

Musk responded with a poop emoji.

Musk, the world's richest person on paper, then followed up 14 minutes later with: ""So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter.""

Thill says Musk is simply trying to negotiate a lower price for Twitter. A fair value for Twitter in light of the rout in tech stocks in recent months would be $42 a share, Thill estimates.

Other analysts on Wall Street think a deal doesn't get done.

""The chances of a deal ultimately getting done is not looking good now and it's likely a 60%+ chance from our view Musk ultimately walks from the deal and pays the breakup fee,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.

602,Elon Musk's Twitter tantrum is a gamble that may not pay off,"elon musk twitter gamble

Elon Musk got off lightly the last time he backed out of a multi-billion dollar deal.

When the billionaire botched a $72bn (£58bn) attempt to take his electric car company Tesla private in 2018, he earned a figurative slap on the wrist.

Regulators fined Musk a token $20m and forced him to step down as Tesla chairman, but he remained in charge, steering it to become the car industry’s most valuable company and becoming the world’s wealthiest man in the process.

Unwinding his offer to buy Twitter is unlikely to be so simple. Last Friday Musk said the $44bn deal was “on hold” as he demanded the social network hand over more information on how many fake and spam accounts plague the service. On Tuesday, he said “this deal cannot move forward” until the company comes clean about its calculation that under 5pc of daily users are illegitimate.

Musk’s concerns, aired in public to his 94m Twitter followers, reflect a genuine grievance: the Tesla billionaire has repeatedly said that dealing with spam bots is one of his top priorities for Twitter. But his actions have been widely perceived as an attempt as a high-wire attempt to slash the price he is paying for Twitter, or back out of the deal completely.

Twitter shares, which have traded below Musk’s $54.20 offer price since the deal was agreed on April 25, have plunged in recent days. On Tuesday, they traded more than 30pc below Musk’s offer price.

Musk has admitted that he could seek to buy Twitter at a knock-down price, telling a conference on Monday that it was not “out of the question”.

Twitter seems prepared to challenge him. In a US filing, the company said it was “committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable”.

Playing hardball has served Musk well so far, however. After revealing his $44bn bid for Twitter on April 14, Musk stood by it, refusing to raise his offer as the company’s board scrambled to respond and sought to rally investors against the Tesla chief.

Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2022

Musk correctly bet that investors would pressure the company to accept the offer, and 10 days after making his bid, threatened to go directly to them. “I have attached a merger agreement that is ‘seller friendly’ and that does not require you to recommend in favour of my offer. This will provide all shareholders a voice, and allow for a democratic decision consistent with Twitter’s ethos,” he wrote to Twitter chairman Bret Taylor. The day later, Twitter’s board capitulated and accepted Musk’s offer.

But he is on more shaky ground this time. Musk’s agreement to buy the company, which expires in October, is binding. The $1bn break fee the billionaire has agreed to pay if the deal fails applies only if the deal is scuppered by other means, such as if regulators block it. Simply walking away invites a potential lawsuit.

None the less, Musk appears set for a fight. He claims Twitter has wildly underestimated the number of fake accounts on the service and said on Tuesday that his offer “was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate”. Musk claims that the true number of fake users could be at least 50pc, more than 10 times what Twitter itself says.

Independent researchers said Musk may have a point. Figures from market research company SparkToro and analytics firm FollowerWonk claim that Twitter may be undercounting fake accounts by four times. They said an analysis of accounts over the weekend suggested the true number is around 20pc, although they admitted that it had less data than Twitter itself.

The firms added that high-profile accounts such as Musk’s are more likely to attract bots and spam accounts, with as many as 70pc of Musk’s own followers “unlikely to be authentic”.

Twitter has admitted that its own figures for the number of fake accounts are merely estimates, meaning even if Musk is correct that Twitter is undercounting, he has little ground on which to claim he has been misled.

The company said on Tuesday that Musk can only back out of the deal if Twitter reneges on standard takeover promises, such as not to make large acquisitions before the deal closes. elon musk - John Raoux/AP

“It’s a very, very weak legal case,” says John Coffee, of the Centre on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School in New York. “He's in the weakest possible position. He did no due diligence. He wanted to rush it [the deal], he wanted it expedited.

“Delaware [where Twitter is registered] will almost never let you escape a merger agreement, unless it's something that would shock the entire world.”

Twitter could seek an injunction forcing Musk to go ahead with the deal. But even if it has the right to take Musk to court, it may not have the appetite. His fortune of more than $200bn makes him worth several times what Twitter is worth, giving him plenty of firepower for a protracted legal battle. Musk has plenty of courtroom history, launching legal challenges against the Securities and Exchange Commission over a 2018 settlement related to the botched Tesla deal, and successfully defending himself in a defamation case brought by a British caving expert whom he had called a “pedo guy”.

Coffee says Musk is likely to be gambling that Twitter would rather sell itself at a lower price than go through years of litigation against an unpredictable and high-profile target.

“Nobody is going to pay a higher price than $54.20. They may get damages. But they have a year of uncertainty,” he says.

It would not be the first time. One veteran banker compares the conflict to French luxury giant LVMH’s takeover of the US jeweller Tiffany last year. After agreeing a $16.2bn takeover in 2019, LVMH attempted to back out during the pandemic. Tiffany sued and ultimately the deal went ahead, but at a slightly reduced $15.8bn.

Musk may demand a bigger discount than that. Short seller Hindenburg Research said last week that a recent tech crash means Twitter shares would be worth around $31 if Musk had not launched his takeover bid. On Tuesday they were trading at $37, indicating that investors believe a deal will still happen.

“Fear is an interesting thing with shareholders - Musk is going to engineer his way into getting this,” says Jonathan Cohen, partner at law firm Ashurst. “You can't halve the price clearly, but there will be some deal done. They'll swallow it, take a price chip and cosy up to their new master.”",2022-05-17T17:31:44+00:00

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: OK, and so within EVs right now, you've got this super high cost, high value. I mean, you were able to sit in the Mercedes EQ3 over the weekend, and then you've got that mass-market kind of entry point that some of the manufacturers are trying to get, right, where we've actually got the video of that EQ3 car.

- That's Pras' car.

- Yeah.

- Congrats, Pras. [LAUGHING]

BRAD SMITH: Well, tell us about that experience too, number one, and then exactly where you see some of these high cost, high value plays netting out?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, Brad, I was in the EQS the Mercedes--

BRAD SMITH: EQS.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.

BRAD SMITH: OK, my bad.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: The top-of-the-line Mercedes electric vehicle. It's going to be a whole new EQ platform they're building all their cars on. I mean, this is the most-- this is the biggest one, the big daddy if you will. All the tech in there, and I got to say just my initial thoughts are at this level, you sit in that car, and Brad, you were inside that car too. It is like you're stepping into the future, right.

BRAD SMITH: Yeah.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: A huge hyper screen all the way across the dash. The car is super quiet, rides on air suspension, immediate power, immediate torque. It's just a smooth, you know. Besides I know you love the EVs, but it's a different experience.

- Too ugly. I've told you this before I don't like the design.

JULIE HYMAN: Well, it's a different experience because you have car makers that happen to make electric vehicles versus an electric vehicle maker that's a computer on wheels. When you're talking about something like a Tesla, just a different experience, right, I'm curious when you talk about the EV penetration. What happens to that number if you put hybrids on top of it because I imagine that boost the number quite a bit?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Oh, yeah. Big time. I mean, the biggest-- the highest selling hybrid is the G 4XE hybrid, and that sold like tens of thousands of cars last year. So you add that into the mix you're going to pump up that. I would say if you add hybrids, I mean, maybe back off the hand math 15-20% maybe.

Story continues

I mean, these hybrids are a huge part of the market, and people love them. So that's absolutely right. I think that's kind of the right way to look at it is like we're transitioning into the full EV potentially in 10, 15 years, and hybrids are sort of a big step in the middle.

JULIE HYMAN: Bridge step.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, exactly.

BRAD SMITH: Is charging infrastructure ramping quickly enough to really support some of the demand?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I don't think so, Brad. I think there's still a long way to go with the charging infrastructure, at least in New York City and the East Coast. Maybe it's different in the West Coast, but out here, it seems it's impossible to find. I went to Woodbury Commons last weekend with this car as a test, and there was maybe 20 EVgo Chargers. They were all full of Teslas. [LAUGHING] So good luck.

JULIE HYMAN: No space for you.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: No space. I was iced out.

JULIE HYMAN: What did you do? Were you stuck?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: No. Well, this car runs 400 miles of range, so I didn't actually have to charge it. I wanted to just top off a little bit.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it was more for research, yes.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, research.

BRIAN SOZZI: If you get stuck in your various EV tests, you give me a call, Pras. I'll come in my gas-guzzling '91 Trans Am. [LAUGHING] I'll pick you up, baby. I got you.

JULIE HYMAN: I thought you had like a portable charger you were going to come to him with.

BRIAN SOZZI: No, just give me a call. I got you. I got you.

* Walmart slides after cutting earnings forecast

* April retail sales rise in line with estimates

* Indexes: S&P 500 +1.27%, Nasdaq +1.76%, Dow +0.74% (Updates with details on afternoon trading)

By Amruta Khandekar and Noel Randewich

May 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Tuesday, lifted by Apple, Tesla and other megacap growth stocks after strong retail sales in April eased worries about slowing economic growth.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sector indexes advanced, with financials, materials and technology each up over 2%.

Investors were cheered by data showing U.S. retail sales increased 0.9% in April as consumers bought motor vehicles amid an improvement in supply and frequented restaurants.

Recently punished shares of Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc, Tesla Inc and Amazon gained between 1.3% and 4.4%, lifting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

Tuesday's broad rally followed weeks of selling on the U.S. stock market that last week saw the S&P 500 sink to its lowest level since March 2021.

""The largest pockets of stocks that investors tend to buy have been essentially beaten up. They're either in correction or bear market territory,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer of Defiance ETF. ""I think investors are looking at these opportunities to buy on the dip, and I suspect that today is a good day to do that.""

The S&P 500 Banks index jumped 3.1%, with Citigroup climbing 7.9% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a nearly $3 billion investment in the U.S. lender.

Another set of economic data showed industrial production accelerated 1.1% last month, higher than estimates of 0.5%, and faster than a 0.9% advance in March.

""This is consistent with continued economic growth in the second quarter and not a recession underway,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank in Dallas.

In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was up 1.27% at 4,059.02 points.

The Nasdaq gained 1.76% to 11,868.20 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.74% at 32,461.93 points.

Walmart Inc tumbled about 11% after the retail giant cut its annual profit forecast, signaling a bigger hit to margins.

Retailers Costco, Target and Dollar Tree fell between 0.9% and 2.1%.

United Airlines Holdings Inc gained 7.3% after the carrier lifted its current-quarter revenue forecast, boosting shares of Delta Air, American Airlines and Spirit Airlines.

A positive first-quarter earnings season has been overshadowed by worries about the conflict in Ukraine, soaring inflation, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and aggressive policy tightening by central banks.

609,"New electric vehicle registrations spike in Q1, led by Tesla","The EV (electrical vehicle) wave is building here in the U.S. New data from Experian Automotive, the data collection company’s automotive arm, shows new registrations for EVs have jumped 60% from a year ago in the first quarter and have hit an all-time high of 4.6% of the overall market.

This comes as overall registrations are down 18% from a year ago, as the chip and component crunch, among other things, are keeping dealer supply at a minimum.

Nevertheless, this big jump in EV ownership raises the question of whether the U.S. has finally turned the corner on mass adoption of electric vehicles.

One reason for more registrations is that there are simply more EVs for sale in the U.S. than in the past. Cars like the Kia EV6 and Niro EV, sister brand Hyundai’s Ioniq 5, and Ford’s (F) Mustang Mach-E, all posted registrations in the thousands in Q1, big jumps from a year ago.

Of course the big dog, if you will, in the EV space is Tesla (TSLA), the number one brand by a long shot. All four of Tesla’s models were in the top ten of EVs registered in the U.S, with the Model Y (52,051), Model 3 (47,682), and Model S (9,250) the top 3 most registered models.

Tesla’s share of the EV market in Q1 stood at a whopping 70% of the total market, with the brand seeing its registrations climb 60% from a year ago.

How EV ownership in the U.S. can keep expanding CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - FEBRUARY 10: Ford shows off the 2021 Mustang Mach-E GT during the Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place convention center on February 10, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois. The show, the nation's largest and longest-running auto show, will open to the public on February 12 and run through February 21. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)

In order to see EV ownership climb further in the U.S., experts say at least three things need to happen. First, supply needs to keep growing, which is problematic given the chip and component shortages afflicting the industry so far.

Tesla has seen its waiting list for vehicle orders push out into late 2022, if not into 2023 depending on model and trim. For its part, Tesla is ramping up with new factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin, Germany, to meet demand. GM and Ford claim they have enough battery materials to meet their EV production needs through 2023.

Second, there needs to be more investment in the charging infrastructure here in the U.S. to limit concerns like range anxiety that plague many potential EV buyers. The Biden Administration has offered $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure funding, and other private sector companies like Charge (CRGE) are looking to capitalize on this build out across the country.

Story continues

Perhaps the biggest impediment to EV adoption are vehicles that most Americans can afford. Kia’s EV6 ($40,900) and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 ($39,950) are reasonably priced EVs, as is Volkswagen’s (VOW.DE) ID.4 ($41,955), but there aren’t that many EVs around in that price range.

The Nissan Leaf is also a cheap option, but its range (149 miles) is limited compared to the Kia EV6 (232 miles), Ioniq 5 (303 miles), and ID.4 (260 miles).

The starting price of the base Ford Mustang Mach-E is around $46,596, and the cheapest Tesla, the Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive, goes for $46,990.

Without providing resources like government rebates or incentives for cheaper EVs, “we aren’t going to see this get to our low-income compatriots,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a recent interview.

Eventually Chevrolet’s (GM) Bolt EV ($31,500 starting price, 259 mile range) will be back in production and on dealer lots soon, which will alleviate some of the supply issues and give everyday Americans another more affordable EV option.

But without cheaper cars and available infrastructure, it may be difficult to move the needle beyond 5% adoption in the U.S.

But some analysts think the billionaire is just looking for a scapegoat so he can walk away from the $44 billion deal or negotiate a lower price.

“Elon Musk's recent comments suggest he is trying to negotiate a lower offer price,” Jefferies equity analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note titled ""Looking for a Scapegoat; Lower Bid to Come?""

“We believe that Musk is using his investigation into the % of fake TWTR accounts as an excuse to pay below $54.20/share. In reality, the NASDAQ COMP is down 25% [year to date] and Elon Musk realizes that he may be overpaying for the asset,” the analyst wrote.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives was similarly skeptical of Musk's claim in a note to clients: “Our view is the massive pressure on Tesla's stock since the deal, a changing stock market/risk environment the last month, and a number of other financing factors (equity financing) has caused Musk to get 'cold feet' on the Twitter deal with the bot issue not a new issue and likely more of a scapegoat to push for a lower price.”

After adding to his stake in the company, Musk offered to buy the social media company for $54.20 a share in April. The stock is currently trading at around $38 a share, as of May 17.

Musk raised doubts about the buyout when he tweeted on Friday that the deal was ""on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users."" Later that day, Musk tweeted again that he is ""still committed"" to the acquisition.

""The bot issue at the end of the day was known by the New York City cab driver and feels more to us like the 'dog ate the homework' excuse to bail on the Twitter deal or talk down a lower price,"" Ives stated. ""The soap opera will continue this week, and keep the popcorn handy as there are likely many more twists and turns ahead in this Twitter/Musk saga.""

Twitter spam

This development follows Musk's comments at the All-In Summit in Miami, where he said a deal for Twitter at a lower price would not be ""out of the question.""

In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk said that ""20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher. My offer was based on Twitter's SEC filings being accurate.""

20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.

Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.

This deal cannot move forward until he does.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2022

According to Thill, Musk's estimation of spam and fake accounts would make his targets more incredulous.

""We were already skeptical of Musk's reported targets of 600M and 931M mDAUs [monetizable daily active users] by 2025 and 2028, respectively,"" Thill stated. ""Now considering Musk believes that at most 80% of TWTR's current 229M mDAUs are humans, it is even harder to believe the company can achieve its long-term targets.""

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal pushed back on Musk's claims by posting a long thread on Twitter detailing how the company calculates its bots. Agrawal said that he ""shared an overview of the estimation process with Elon a week ago"" — to which Musk replied with a poop emoji.

We suspend over half a million spam accounts every day, usually before any of you even see them on Twitter. We also lock millions of accounts each week that we suspect may be spam – if they can’t pass human verification challenges (captchas, phone verification, etc).

— Parag Agrawal (@paraga) May 16, 2022

Despite the growing rift between Agrawal and Musk, the two sides have continued to move forward with the deal. Twitter's board unanimously recommended that shareholders approve Musk's offer that would take the social media company private, Bloomberg reported. And on Friday, Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, tweeted: “We remain committed to our agreement.”

Should the deal fail to go through, however, it could be a disaster for Twitter stock.

Thill estimated that the stock could down to $22 a share in a no-deal scenario, while Ives wrote that ""the chances of a deal ultimately getting done is not looking good now and it's likely a 60%+ chance from our view Musk ultimately walks from the deal and pays the breakup fee.""

615,Is The Bottom In Or Is It Just Another Dead Cat Bounce?,"Fed Chair Powell called a bottom in 2022’s multiple-compression correction at a WSJ conference on Tuesday (5/17) when he suggested that the public equity markets had already been priced for the aggressive monetary tightening measures the Fed is preparing for.

A stronger than expected retail sales report from April before the opening bell provided Jay Powell’s “soft-landing” monetary narrative (claiming that the healthy US economy can easily manage 2 additional 50-bps rate hikes) with ancillary support. April’s pricing pressures were easily brushed off by euphoric consumers who are thrilled for the first COVID-free summer since 2019 as the Roaring 20s we’ve all been waiting for officially kicks off.

Stagflation fears have been temporarily abated after Tuesday morning’s retail sales report revealed that excessive demand continues to be a significant price driver, with real retail sales (adjusted for inflation) growing by 0.6% in April (compared to the month prior).

Retail Sales

April’s retail sales report provided us with a clearer picture of how the US consumer responds to the Fed’s initial monetary tightening measures, showing us that consumers are less worried about prices today than ever before.

Growing demand continues to be the primary inflationary driver, which reinforces the Fed’s increasingly hawkish positioning.

If inflation were occurring in the absence of demand, this would be a clear indicator of potential stagflation (low/negative GDP growth while inflation runs wild). However, April’s hotter than expected consumer spending (excluding volatile vehicles) illustrates just how healthy our flourishing economy continues to be.

The bulk of the consumer spending growth came from the rapidly reviving service spending with restaurants and bars now fully open, as well as new clothes to impress an open world like we haven’t seen in almost 3 years now, and of course, electronics continued to see outsized demand (which I expect to be a secular driver of consumer spending in the years to come).

Story continues

This level of sustained economic growth gives me and the rest of the market a bit more faith in the Fed’s “soft-landing” target, demonstrating the continued health of the underlying consumer.

Real GDP growth for Q2 is now on track to come in positive, nullifying many of the market’s recessionary outlooks (2 quarters of negative real GDP growth, after the US economy’s -1.4% real contraction in Q1).

The Capitulation We’ve Been Waiting For?

The Nasdaq 100 plunged to its lowest level in 18-months in last Thursday’s intra-day action, but the clearly exhausted selling from already capitulated retail investors, drove the smart money back onto the bid in the final hours of Thursday trading, which ended pouring into Friday’s high-growth rocket-ship session.

High-growth innovators have been the public market’s punching bag since the year began, with short-sellers driving the most speculative equities (negative earnings & rich valuations) to the core of the earth.

Cathie Wood’s popularized Ark Innovation ETF ARKK, a favorite among this young new class of market participants, perfectly depicts the indiscriminate nature of 2022’s high-growth drop-off. ARKK plunged an unprecedented -65% year-to-date at the over 2-year lows it reached on Thursday (5/12), which ended up being this “innovation-benchmark’s” highest volume day in its almost 8-year history, as savvy short-sellers double-bought the bottom to not just cover their negative position but go long (bought twice as much as they had shorted).

ARKK shot over 11.8% out of the egregiously oversold RSI levels it reached Thursday afternoon, in the week’s final trading session, which may just be this actively traded ETF’s best 1-day return ever. This is not surprising considering ARKK’s unprecedented valuation compression from a 55x price-to-sales multiple to less than 12x (its lowest aggregate P/S in over 2 years) in the 4.5 months since 2022, which is unheard of (typically, this type of share price decline would coincide with a big drop in sales estimates).

Deep-pocketed institutional players – who are privy to unique real-time market data and employ smart algorithmic/computer-programmed trading strategies to leverage it – have been utilizing behavioral trading techniques to take advantage of the emotion-driven retail trading community, positioning the recently democratized US market’s unparalleled tidal wave of new investors at the center of the action once more.

The Individual Investor Remains on The Wrong Side of Wall Street

The mass-market exodus from surrendering retail traders on Tuesday (5/10) and Wednesday (5/11) of this past week ($1.9 billion in net outflows over this 2-day panic dumping spree) signaled the capitulation that strategic short-sellers had been waiting for to reverse their market narratives (market capitulation from emotion-driven amateurs typically indicates exhausted selling pressures).

This occurred just one week after this novice group of market participants poured a record $2.6 billion (the largest 1-day inflow from retail investors ever) into the market last Thursday (5/5) following Fed Chair Powell’s market soothing words of economic resilience amid this period of aggressive monetary tightening. However, Wednesday (5/11) morning’s “hotter than expected” CPI growth depicting prolonged inflation had these already nervous “bag holders” running for the hills.

There was nothing coincidental about this counterintuitive action, as Wall Street’s finest continues to drive the narrative on the accurate predication that individual investors will continue to make emotion-fueled trading decisions (which unfortunately causes many to buy peaks and sell troughs).

Individual traders/investors had been attempting to call a bottom in this market for weeks now, as patient dip-buyers flooded into the market after each of the 3 dead cat bounces (false bottoms indicated in the chart below) 2022 has tempted investors with, which inevitably led to last Thursday’s market surrender and subsequent whiplash reversal. Trading View

Individual market participants account for a larger share of the market’s action than at any prior point in history. However, retail investors are still at the mercy of Wall Street’s biggest and baddest trading groups, which are not only better informed but less emotionally driven than their retail counterparts.

The best (and really only) investing strategy that you can employ to avoid significant losses on these market fake-outs is by price averaging lower at each of the respective “false bottoms,” scaling into your favorite long-term positions at predetermined buy levels to ensure that you achieve the best longer-run returns.

The CPI Report

The market’s preferred inflation gauge came in fiercer than expected this past Wednesday (5/11), with core CPI jumping 0.6% in April, which was more inflamed than economists’ 0.4% estimate. The 3-month inflation deceleration trend confirmation that investors were hoping for didn’t show up, and sellers once again took control of this increasingly illiquid market.

The headline CPI figure for April showed an 8.3% increase from last April, which was slightly lower than March’s 8.5% year-over-year increase as a result of marginally easing pressures at the pump, but there remains little evidence that core inflation has cooled.

Airfares saw an unprecedented 18.6% jump last month, marking its largest 1-month surge on record (dating back to 1963), as eager vacationers rushed to book their summer holidays the momentum of the federal mask mandate in the back half of April. This uptick in vacations may not last long though, as the market is now priced for a prolonged economic downturn.

The ARKK Complex

Cathie Wood and her now infamous Ark Innovation ETF ARKK have experienced a level of value decaying multiple compression as I’ve never seen before. ARKK, which had been hailed as the market’s innovation benchmark, after rallying nearly 400% in the 11-month bull run out of its pandemic slump, nearly retested its March 2020 lows last week, having lost over 75% of its value in the past 14 months.

Increasingly hawkish sentiment can be attributed to a large portion of Cathie Wood’s massive 2022 losses due to these holdings’ ultra-high-growth profile (value being driven by cash-flows that are years out), which makes them highly sensitive to interest rate moves. Not to mention the basketing effect that this fund’s popularity created, exemplified by Tuttle Capital’s perfectly timed Short ARKK ETF (ARKK), which is up 125% swelling daily volumes since it launched last November (compared to the 65% decline ARKK saw over that timeframe).

Despite the massive losses ARKK has sustained in 2022, retail investors have been flooding into this ETF with vigor, as $1.3 billion in net inflows pours into this ETF year-to-date with hopes of seeing some of Cathie’s long-term predictions (5 to 10 years out) come to fruition.

Cathie’s claim to fame was built on her longer-term innovation calls, namely her $4,000 per share Tesla TSLA prediction back in April 2019 ($800 per share post-split), which represented a 1,500% upside at the time and miraculously came to fruition less than 2 years after she made her claim. The pandemic’s interest rate obliterating effect is why Cathie Wood has been estimated as an investment guru, but I am beginning to lose faith in her approach.

I had an enormous amount of confidence in the ETF prior to the pandemic, as it was full of exciting next-generation holdings that were still incredibly nascent and below most institutional investors’ radar. Unfortunately, the tidal wave of cash she had to deploy following the pandemic-powered retail investor revolution (who have a clear penchant for stocks of the future) has limited her investment scope to larger-cap equities due to an implicit ownership cap of around 10% (the insignificance of investments in any company worth less than $5 billion is clearly depicted in her portfolio).

The fund is almost certainly undervalued today (showed by the record 11.8% daily pump on Friday), but I am losing faith in her longer-term ability to uncover those hidden “market disruptors” with Tesla TSLA, Zoom ZM, and Roku ROKU, now the 3 largest holdings. ARKK's biggest drivers no longer carry the “under-the-radar” growth-fueled value qualities that I had esteemed Wood for prior to the pandemic.

Final Thoughts

The best inflation protection and all-around best place to invest in this environment is the recently compressed innovation space (looking for companies driving secular positive free cash flow narratives). Wall Street’s leading digitizers will grow in the face of any economic climate as these market disruptors prove to be an indispensable competitive necessity as the Roaring 20s commence.

The electric vehicle (EV) space is sporting reasonable valuations, thanks to the correction witnessed amid the current geopolitical and macroeconomic turbulences. After peaking at $57.71 on Nov. 22, 2021, the iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IDRV) has pulled back notably toward its lowest level in about 1-1/2 half years.

Apparently, there is a mismatch between valuations and the outlook for EVs. There is no denying of the fact that the present is tense for the industry. Components are in short supply and the Covid lockdowns in China hasn’t helped matters any further. The demand picture isn’t very encouraging as well, as inflation and a rising rate environment have set tongues wagging about demand destruction.

For those willing to look past the current noises, the rewards could be disproportionate. The largest automotive markets of the world, namely the European Union, U.S. and China will look to greatly expand EV capacity by 2035, management consultancy firm McKinsey estimates. If full-electrification target for the year is hit, just imagine the kind of potential opportunity before EV makers.

Shenzhen, China-based BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is one EV stock that has surprised me with its resilience. This Warren Buffett-backed company has consistently delivered against all odds even when the going has been tough for the industry as a whole.

April deliveries reported earlier this month stand testament to this fact. When global EV market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) sold merely 1,512 vehicles in China, BYD delivered 57,403 units of battery EVs, up 270% year-over-year. Defying the Covid lockdowns and supply challenges, it produced 57,593 BEVs.

As a policy, BYD stopped manufacturing internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles from March.

The company has been actively exporting to overseas customers, particularly in Latin America and Africa. Apart from its thriving EV business, the company is into the manufacturing of batteries for EVs. It takes away the third position among battery manufacturers, commanding roughly 12% share of the overall market.

Since the start of the year, BYD’s stock trading over the counter has shed about 16%.

Nio (NYSE:NIO) may have tested the patience of its loyal investor base but it is one sound investment trading at depressed levels. The company had a disappointing 2021 when it did not launch any new product. Come 2022, analysts and investors began pinning their hopes on a volume rebound, thanks to three new models planned for the year.

Extraneous risks, however, came upon the company like a bolt in the blue. The Ukraine war squeezed the supply chain and sent input prices spiraling upward. Even before things could stabilize on that front, the Covid resurgence in China hit domestic EV makers, including Nio.

Nio said in its April deliveries update that component supplies, production and logistics all suffered due to the lockdown restrictions in place. Moreover, Nio had to contend with delisting fears in the U.S., as it was among the companies provisionally identified by the Securities Exchange Commission for non-compliance with audit review requirement.

The company has quickly moved to mitigate this risk by expediting its Singapore listing.

XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) has been an outperformer through 2021 even as its bigger rival Nio floundered. The company has been nimble enough to adapt to changing consumer preferences and lap up new technology and markets.

The Guangzhou-headquartered company rushed in to capture most of the post-pandemic demand in China in 2021 by launching a new family sedan, named P5. It also unveiled an upgraded version of its G3 SUV. Overall, it delivered 98,155 vehicles in 2021. The product slate for 2022 includes the G9 SUV, a vehicle developed for both Chinese and international markets.

XPeng entered Norway ahead of peer Nio, marking its maiden overseas foray. It now has a presence in Sweden and the Netherlands.

Like Nio, XPeng could be in for a strong bounce back when external risks mitigate.

Since the start of the year, the stock has lost about 53%. Analysts, on average, expect the stock to double to $48.31.

Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), which rounds up the U.S.-listed Chinese EV trio, comes off as a less glamorous company. It doesn’t carry out publicity campaigns around Wall Street and chooses to let numbers talk for its performance.

Recent quarterly results from the company showed a narrower loss and a 168% year-over-year revenue growth. Gross margin was at a commendable 22.6%. The Covid lockdowns, however, prompted the company to issue muted production and revenue forecasts for the second quarter.

The company plans to launch its L9 extended range SUV shortly and two more SUVs down the line in 2023.

Li Auto stock has pulled back by about 26% in the year-to-date period. The average analyst price target of $37.06 suggests 56% upside from current levels.

Any EV portfolio would be incomplete without Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as part of the holdings. The company is a true global player. It currently has production units in the U.S., China and Europe, and sells EVs across the globe. The company is helmed by a visionary leader who leads from the front.

Despite the mushrooming of competition, Tesla has managed to stay ahead. Its detractors often call out the stock for being overvalued, and they may not be totally off the mark with their assessment. Tesla stock is trading at a Price/Sales ratio of 14.05, notably higher than legacy automakers and some of its EV brethren.

The premium valuation is justified, contends analysts. An updated price target announced by Cathie Wood shows the firm expects Tesla stock to reach $4,600 by 2026. About 60% of value and over half of EBITDA will come from the planned robotaxi business.

And then there is the promise of a stock split. The company said in a 8-K filing in late March it will seek shareholder approval for increasing its authorized capital in order to be able to implement a stock split. When Tesla last split its stock in August 2020, it ran up sharply after the event.

Tesla stock has shed 29% year-to-date and promises over 30% upside, based on the average analysts’ price target of $976.22.

Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) moved into the spotlight with claims that its Air sedan has a range superior to Tesla. The company began deliveries of its Lucid Air Dream Edition in late October and it sold 125 cars to customers in the fourth quarter. They sold a further 360 vehicles in Q1 2022.

Customer reservations at the end of the first quarter totaled 30,000, tallying $2.9 billion in reservations. The company reiterated its production guidance of 12,000-14,000 units in 2022. Lucid announced in April a deal to supply the Saudi government with 100,000 vehicles over a 10-year timeframe. The company confirmed earlier this year that it plans to build an EV plant in Saudi Arabia.

The company has to be laser-focused on execution and manage its supply chain. With the recent price hikes announced in the U.S. and Canada, the pricier Air sedan models got a little more expensive.

Among the legacy automakers, Ford (NYSE:F) has found great success with its EVs transition strategy thanks to its proactive stance. The Ford+ plan announced in May 2021 and the company’s decision to form distinct auto units, are all testament to its commitment toward a quicker transition away from ICE vehicles.

Ford hopes to manufacture 2 million EVs by 2030, and by 2035, it expects EVs to represent half of its global vehicle sales. Dearborn’s EV lineup includes the Mustang Mach E, the E-transit van and the recently launched F-150 Lightning EV truck.

The selloff hasn’t spared Ford shares either. The stock is down about 35.5% YTD. The average analysts’ price target for Ford shares is $18.40, pointing to over 37% upside.

618,Tesla to host second artificial intelligence day in August,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc top boss Elon Musk said on Tuesday the electric-car maker will host its second artificial intelligence day on Aug. 19, with the company likely to expand on plans to fine-tune its self-driving technology.

""The purpose of AI Day is to convince great AI/software/chip talent to join Tesla,"" the billionaire said in a tweet.

The use of AI in self-driven cars has stirred up debate around safety issues, but Musk has often contended that such vehicles are far safer than those driven by humans.

Tesla is developing software for its cars to drive without human intervention or oversight, but its full self-driving (FSD) system currently requires human monitoring and is not intended to work without a driver behind the wheel.

The company held its first AI day in August last year and a Battery Day in September 2020, where it talked about the future of battery technology.

""Tesla AI Day #2 on Aug 19. So many cool updates!,"" Musk said in a tweet.

Investors and analysts closely watch tech-focused events where companies dive deeper into their projects and usually provide concrete updates on targets and timelines of rollouts.

623,"If Musk has second thoughts about buying Twitter, walking away wouldn’t be as simple as paying a $1 billion break-up fee","On Tuesday, Tesla CEO and potential future owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, tweeted that his proposed $44 billion purchase of the social media platform couldn't proceed unless Twitter could verify—as the company recently reported—that fewer than 5% of accounts on site were fake.

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal had earlier tweeted out an explanation for how the company arrived at its 5% figure, in a thread that culminated in Musk tweeting a poo emoji at the business leader. Musk later claimed on a podcast that his ""lowest estimate"" for how many of Twitter's users are bots ""would be probably 20%."" On Wednesday, Musk tweeted at the SEC asking them to investigate Twitter’s user numbers.

Some observers suspect Musk's obsession with Twitter's bot numbers shows that the bombastic entrepreneur is seeking some justification for backing out of his surprise take over attempt, or is at least angling to negotiate a lower price. But Twitter isn't buying it. On Tuesday, Twitter's board told Bloomberg that it ""intend[s] to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement"" with Musk, at the price he originally offered.

With Twitter now intent to sell, is it too late for Musk to walk away from the deal he initiated?

Breaking up is hard to do

If Musk did abandon his unsolicited Twitter takeover bid, the Tesla CEO would be on the hook for a $1 billion break-up fee written into the preliminary acquisition contract. If Musk really is having buyer's remorse, that break-up fee might look like a cheap way out. The $1 billion sum is far smaller than Musk's $44 billion offer to buy Twitter, and only a fraction of Musk's $230 billion net worth.

But that fee obscures how difficult it would be for Musk to walk away.

""A breakup fee is not an option to walk away,"" Professor Mitu Gulati told Axios. Break up clauses are normally only triggered under specified circumstances—and not just because the buyer thinks they've paid too much. In theory, Twitter could sue for damages if Musk just decides to walk away—although the deal both parties have signed caps potential damages at the value of the termination fee, or $1 billion.

Story continues

Twitter does have another ace up its sleeve, however. Under the company’s sales agreement with Musk, Twitter can sue its potential suitor for “specific performance”, where a court orders the defendant to carry out a specific action—such as fulfil a contract they signed.

However, forcing Musk to carry out his purchase would be only one possible outcome of such a lawsuit. Twitter might settle with Musk, either agreeing to sell the company at a discount, or letting Musk pay a higher fee to call the deal off. Alternatively, the suit might fail entirely, and a judge could decide to let Musk walk away from the deal.

The social media platform might also decide pursuing a lawsuit is too risky and costly. Mergers and acquisitions often lead to job losses, as employees choose to leave rather than work under new management. That means a company in the middle of being bought is already “losing a lot of key employees already as if the new owner were already in charge,” James Woolery, founding partner in law firm Woolery & Co and expert in hostile takeovers, told Fortune. “So they’re willing to settle for a lower price, but not a huge discount.”

Second thoughts

Fake Twitter accounts have been a longtime gripe for Musk, who pledged to get rid of bots when first announcing that he wanted to buy Twitter. But, since purging the site of bots was a key impetus for Musk trying to take the company private, there may be other reasons why Musk might be having second thoughts.

For one, Twitter shares have fallen amid a broader collapse in tech stocks. Twitter’s share price is back to where it was on April 1, when Musk first announced that he’d purchased a 9.2% stake in the social media platform. Tesla stocks have also taken a beating, falling 25% since Musk announced his Twitter deal, as investors worry how the purchase might rebound on the electric carmaker.

The drop in Tesla share price not only makes Musk less wealthy, it complicates his ability to finance the Twitter buyout, as the CEO has offered Tesla share as collateral for some loans. Investors are also noticing that the Twitter deal loads the social media platform with significantly more debt.

Under the terms of the Musk-Twitter deal, estimates research firm CreditSights, Twitter’s debt interest payments will jump from $51 million in 2021 to $900 million after the deal is signed. Servicing those looming debt piles would leave Musk with much less room to risk profits on transforming Twitter's business model.

“This is just a bad capital structure to put on a business like Twitter that has never proven to be highly profitable,” John McClain, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, told Bloomberg.

But despite the noise, advisors on both sides of the deal—who stand to make $133 million if it closes—are continuing to work as if it's going ahead. On Tuesday, Twitter filed a 139-page document—reportedly also approved by Musk—to the SEC explaining the background behind the buyout offer and why Twitter accepted it.

I am not a fan of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or TSLA stock.

I question the basic bull thesis. Having taken the luxury end of the market, the theory goes that Tesla can take the mass market by simply scaling up.

But in markets where there is mass market demand for electric vehicles (EVs), like China and Europe, Tesla’s market share is dropping. The mass market doesn’t need huge batteries, fancy fittings, or a $50,000 price tag. Why pay 18 times revenue to own Cadillac when Chevrolet is what the people want?

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

TSLA Tesla, Inc. $758.69

Dances With Bulls

If I am right, Tesla is overvalued. Tesla is getting fat on the cream of the market when any dairyman knows the big sales are in low fat milk.

The 7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now

Tesla is indeed getting fat. Tesla bears turned into bulls after first quarter numbers came out. Tesla earned $3.3 billion, $2.86/share under GAAP, on first quarter revenue of $18.7 billion. Auto revenues were 87% ahead of a year earlier. But they were just 5% ahead of the previous quarter.

Bulls think Tesla is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), that it has the market sewn up. They say there will be haves and have-nots in the new tech market and Tesla will be one of the haves. They see continuing supply chain worries and assume Tesla will surmount them while rivals won’t.

Tesla has taught its industry many lessons, but the lessons are being learned. Buy a Toyota (NYSE:TM) today and you’ll be faced with a host of services aimed at tying you to the brand. For car dealers, service and support are where the money is. Even General Motors (NYSE:GM) has learned that you build your full line off one platform to keep costs down and focus on battery supply.

Story continues

Despite Tesla’s pretensions, in other words, it’s a car company. No car company is worth 18 times its revenue.

The Great Replacement

A walk around my middle-class neighborhood tells the story. The “Great Replacement” today isn’t people quitting their jobs. It’s replacing America’s gas-guzzling fleet with EVs.

Tesla made the big jump look cool. We have two Teslas on my block. But for most people it’s still a question of small steps. That’s why I recently became the fifth homeowner on my street to buy a Toyota hybrid. It cuts my gas use in half, but I don’t have to worry about finding a plug in the middle of West Virginia. It also cost half what a Tesla costs.

Cars with plugs, like the Tesla, still represent just 5% of the U.S. car market. Hybrids are where the growth is in today’s mass market, which is dominated by Japanese, Korean and Chinese names.

Tesla’s market share in China is falling. In Europe, Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) now have bigger shares of the plug-in market.

The Bottom Line on TSLA Stock

Bulls look at CEO Elon Musk’s effort to buy Twitter (NASDAQ:TWTR) and worry that might distract him. They even bought Tesla when it seemed he might back off the Twitter purchase.

The Twitter saga tells me Musk is bored. Tesla is being run by car guys. The great strategic cut-and-thrust is mostly over. He wants to do something else. So don’t buy or sell Tesla stock based on Musk.

Look at the fundamentals. In the near term, they’re great, but you’re overpaying. In the longer run, they’re troubled, which is why even tech whisperer Cathie Woods has been loading up on GM stock.

My bottom line: Don’t go near Tesla until it can make a Chevy.

626,Musk weighs in on Apple delaying its return-to-office plan with bizarre ‘lazy dog’ meme,"Elon Musk appeared to mock Apple on Wednesday after it emerged that the tech giant is delaying its return-to-office plan.

Responding to a Bloomberg report that outlined Apple’s postponement of plans to bring workers back to the office three days a week, Musk posted a meme that seemed to poke fun at the company and suggest that those who work from home do not, in fact, work.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526826901838483456

The billionaire Tesla CEO hasn’t publicly taken a clear position on the debate around returning to the office, but he reportedly spoke in now-deleted tweets last month about converting Twitter’s headquarters into a homeless shelter since “no one shows up anyway.”

During the initial COVID-19 outbreak, it was reported that workers at Tesla’s plant in Fremont, Calif., were fired for choosing to work from home—claims that Musk has denied, and that Tesla said in a statement were “fundamentally untrue.”

More recently, Musk praised China’s work culture, commending Chinese workers for “burning the 3 a.m. oil” and noting that “they won’t even leave the factory…whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.”

Employees at Twitter—the social media company Musk could be on the verge of taking over—have reportedly raised concerns that their option to work from home full-time could be rescinded if the deal goes through.

Walmart Flashes a Warning Sign to the Entire Consumer Economy US Set to Block Russian Debt Payments, Raising Default Odds Onetime Richest Singapore Tycoon Has Lost 80% of His Fortune Elon Musk Has a Bigger Problem Than Twitter Bots: A Huge Debt Burden Elon Musk Does Not Care About Spam Bots

For more than six weeks now, the tech and finance industry has been riveted by Elon Musk’s pursuit of Twitter.

The topic has sucked up tons of oxygen and contributed to Tesla shares sagging amid a broader market rout and Shanghai’s shutdown to contain the spread of Covid-19.

The deal dominated the friendly conversation Musk had Monday with his buddies behind the All-In Podcast, who asked Tesla’s chief executive officer to elaborate on a tweet last month describing the company as a collection of many startups doing things he says other car companies aren’t. One of the products Musk touched on was Tesla Insurance.

The insurance offering — a passion project for CFO Zachary Kirkhorn — is currently available in just eight states, including California, Illinois and Texas. During the last earnings call, Kirkhorn said Tesla had become the second-largest insurer of its cars in the Lone Star State. Eventually, coverage will be available to 80% of the US, and then the company plans to go international.

Tesla has long tried to draw customers to an ecosystem of products that complement one another: an electric car, a Solar Roof, a home battery known as a Powerwall. It wants to offer consumers an Apple-like suite of goods and services, and insurance is another piece of this strategy.

“The car insurance industry is incredibly inefficient,” Musk told attendees of the All-In Summit in Miami, which he joined virtually for almost 90 minutes. “You’ve got so many middle entities, from insurance agents all the way to the final reinsurer, there’s like a half-dozen companies each taking a cut.”

Tesla charges premiums based on real-time driving data used to compile a monthly safety score. We heard about these scores when the company expanded its controversial Full Self-Driving beta program to more drivers, but there’s an insurance element to it, as well.

Story continues

Five factors impact a safety score: forward collision warnings per 1,000 miles, hard braking, aggressive turning, unsafe following and forced Autopilot disengagement. This differs from traditional determinants such as credit score or age.

“We assume a Safety Score of 90 when you first sign up,” Tesla says on its website. “Your premium can adjust monthly based on your Safety Score. The higher your score is, the lower your premium can be. Tesla will always notify you in advance of your new monthly premium.”

I don’t drive very much, because I live in a city and prefer to ride my bicycle and take public transit to work. My family has one car, an old Subaru. We have excellent insurance through USAA, thanks to my father’s service in the US Air Force. But our premiums are pretty static — they renew every six months and don’t change all that much. There’s no real-time driving data on our old beater.

It’s hard to argue with a product that incentivizes safer driving with lower cost to consumers. That said, it’s worth noting that Tesla markets its products with mixed messages from a safety perspective, often putting heavy emphasis on zero-to-60 acceleration times. There have been plenty of crashes — some of them fatal — involving Tesla drivers traveling at high speeds. Just this month, one careened into an Ohio convention center at about 70 miles per hour. Thankfully, no one was seriously injured or killed.

Do you have Tesla Insurance? I’d love to know what your premiums are, and how you’ve found the dynamic pricing so far. Give me a shout at dhull12@bloomberg.net.

S&P Dow Jones Indices says that Tesla Inc.’s score on environmental, social and governance standards has remained “fairly stable” over the past year, but that it has slipped down the ranks against improving global peers.

The index provider also cited concerns related to working conditions and the firm’s handling of an investigation into deaths and injuries linked to its drive-assistance systems. A lack of low-carbon strategy and codes of business conduct also counted against Elon Musk’s company, it said.

“While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,” Margaret Dorn, senior director and head of ESG indices for S&P Dow Jones in North America, said in a Tuesday blog post.

An analysis seeking to identify risks to the company stemming from any controversial incidents identified “two separate events centered around claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla’s Fremont factory, as well as its handling of the NHTSA investigation after multiple deaths and injuries were linked to its autopilot,” Dorn wrote.

Both had a negative impact on Tesla’s score, she said. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Berkshire Hathaway, Johnson & Johnson and Meta Platforms Inc. were other large companies that were also left out of the ESG gauge.

(Reuters) -S&P Dow Jones Indices has removed electric carmaker Tesla Inc from its widely-followed S&P 500 ESG Index, citing issues including racial discrimination claims and crashes linked to its autopilot vehicles, a move that prompted critical tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday.

Other contributing factors to the changes, effective May 2, included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, the organization's head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview.

Even though Tesla is contributing to reducing emissions with its electric cars, Dorn said, its issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.

""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said.

Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. But after the index changes, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526958110023245829 on Wednesday that ""ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""

The back-and-forth underscores a growing controversy about how to judge corporate ESG performance. Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured money into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting questions about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they have become too involved in setting policy.

S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc..

The removal Tesla was among a group of changes made to the S&P 500 ESG Index dating from April 22, according to an announcement. Among the additions to the index at the same time was Twitter Inc, the social media platform Musk has under agreement to purchase.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

BRIAN CHEUNG: Used car prices fell for the third straight month, declining 4/10 of a percent between March and April. But anyone that has tried to buy a car lately will know that prices still remain relatively high. For more on the used car market, let's bring in TrueCar CEO and President Mike Darrow, alongside Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian, a very interesting conversation here, gentlemen.

I want to start with you, Mike, just to kind of ask you about how TrueCar is viewing the used car market prices again across the board. You're trying to buy a Honda Civic even and it's a high markup compared to where it was pre-pandemic. How is TrueCar navigating this environment right now?

MIKE DARROW: Well, prices are certainly high, Brian, as you mentioned, on the used car side. And a lot of that is driven by limited new car availability. The new cars are down around a million units in franchise inventory for our dealers. And that number was over three million units pre-pandemic. So the limited supply of new cars is creating space for used car pricing, and that's what you're seeing in the market right now.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Mike, Pras here. So TrueCar's business is sort of linking up buyers and sellers online across numerous dealerships and numerous types of buyers. What's this new program you're doing in Florida, and how is that working with people buying stuff fully online?

MIKE DARROW: Yeah, Pras, thanks for asking. We've launched a new program called TrueCar Plus in Florida, where we're enabling consumers to go from what we call from discovery to driveway. So they can start their research on our site, they can find a vehicle that meets their needs. They can actually calculate a real monthly payment, either a loan or a lease, get a cash value for their trade in, actually apply for financing directly online, and then sign a buyer's order right on our platform.

Story continues

So there's been a trend for more and more of the shopping experience to move online. And with TrueCar Plus, we're bringing the entire experience and the ability to buy the vehicle. We've even done some testing and we're beginning to ship vehicles in Florida if a consumer wants a vehicle delivered to their home.

AKIKO FUJITA: Mike, it's Akiko here. We have seen high fuel costs really accelerate the EV adoption, with EVs doubling its market share. And I wonder how much of that has trickled down into the second hand market. We've heard reports, at least over in Europe, where they're seeing more and more used EVs. What are you seeing in your market?

MIKE DARROW: Well, we are starting to see the original set of EVs that were sold new come back to the market. They are an attractive used vehicle right now. And as gas prices stay high, you know, I'm here in Southern California and gas prices are approaching $7 in this market. So you know, I think as gas prices stay up, as more and more used cars, EVs come back as used cars, they'll be viable alternatives on the used car market.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Mike, so sticking with used cars, talking about the TrueCar model, how is that, is it better or different or is it a preferable model compared to the Carvanas and the Vrooms of the world, where they actually have to buy inventory and sell cars actually service them and sell them versus what you guys do, is match buyers and sellers

MIKE DARROW: Right, yeah, we like to talk about, Pras, is we have a very asset light model. We sit right in the middle of supply and demand. We want to be the technology and the platform, the marketplace, if you will, that connects consumers with our retail partners and enables that transaction to happen. And we'll continue to advance it from a digital perspective and allow consumers to do more and more of that in the comfort of their home.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And, Mike, you've been around the business for a while both at the OEM level and also at the Edmunds research level, and now TrueCar. What are some of your big tips for people looking to buy a car new or used right now, given where the market is?

MIKE DARROW: Yeah, I think the biggest tip I can give people is, do your research online. The days of being able to drive to your local dealership and shop through a big selection don't exist anymore. You need to do your research, use a site like truecar.com, find a vehicle that meet your needs, spend some time understanding the affordability of that vehicle. There's a lot of tools out there to help consumers make sure they're looking at the right type of vehicles. And do as much of that work online before you go and meet with a dealer and try to execute a transition at retail.

BRIAN CHEUNG: And, Mike, lastly, I want to ask here about your company and just kind of how you're watching the noise right now. Because you're traded as TRUE, T-R-U-E, but it's been a very rocky environment for you and your peers in the used car marketplace industry. We saw what happened with Carvana stock this week falling precipitously.

Your stock holding up pretty well a year to date. But just kind of wanted to ask about investor pressure. Is the interpretation here that look, at the end of the day, if used car prices continue to fall down, that's worse for your margins? How difficult is it to kind of read what shareholders are looking for right now?

MIKE DARROW: Well, we're certainly feeling some of the pressure of what's going on in the marketplace right now, Brian. We're fortunate in that we've got a really strong balance sheet. We've got a lot of cash on hand and no debt. So we're trying to stay focused on what we want to accomplish. We want to bring more and more of the buying process online, make it easy and transparent for a consumer, and efficient for our retail partners. So we're staying focused on what's at hand for us. But we're certainly feeling some of the pressure that's going on in the market for sure.

May 18 (Reuters) - S&P Dow Jones Indices has removed electric carmaker Tesla Inc from its widely-followed S&P 500 ESG Index, citing issues including racial discrimination claims and crashes linked to its autopilot vehicles, a move that prompted critical tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday.

Other contributing factors to the changes, effective May 2, included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, the organization's head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview.

Even though Tesla is contributing to reducing emissions with its electric cars, Dorn said, its issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.

""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said.

Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. But after the index changes, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526958110023245829 on Wednesday that ""ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""

The back-and-forth underscores a growing controversy about how to judge corporate ESG performance. Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured money into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting questions about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they have become too involved in setting policy.

S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc. .

The removal Tesla was among a group of changes made to the S&P 500 ESG Index dating from April 22, according to an announcement. Among the additions to the index at the same time was Twitter Inc, the social media platform Musk has under agreement to purchase.

Dorn and others did not immediately describe the reasons Twitter was added.

647,Why Tesla Stock Fell Again Today,"Shares of electric vehicle (EV) kingpin Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) dropped sharply in Wednesday early afternoon trading, falling 5.2% through 12:10 p.m. ET. You can blame two Wall Street analysts for that drop: Piper Sandler and France's Exane BNP Paribas. In twin reports this morning, first Piper Sandler cut its price target on Tesla to $1,035 per share (but maintained its overweight rating), and then Exane BNP Paribas cut its price target on Tesla to $600, and reiterated its underperform (i.e., sell) rating.",2022-05-18T17:20:11+00:00
648,Musk claims S&amp;P ‘lost their integrity’ after Tesla gets booted from sustainability index while Exxon is included,"Investigations into its Autopilot self-driving feature along with allegations over pervasive racism at Elon Musk’s Tesla factory in California have cost the world's largest electric vehicle maker a place in the Standard & Poor’s sustainability index.

On Tuesday, the index provider announced changes resulting from its annual rebalancing, revealing the electric vehicle pioneer failed to make the cut along with Berkshire Hathaway, Johnson & Johnson and Meta, while companies like ExxonMobil were left in.

Musk took to Twitter, saying ""ESG is a scam"" and adding that S&P had ""lost their credibility."" He said the sustainability criteria put in place by S&P really have to do with ""how compliant your business is with the leftist agenda.""

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526960512231153664?s=20u0026t=w-uUFBoXGm_E1oRGLJGQpw

S&P said points were withdrawn from Tesla in part due to the lack of a low carbon strategy as well as issues surrounding its code of conduct, pushing it below industry peers that were catching up.

Yet reputational and regulatory risks appear to have really tripped up Tesla's place on the index.

During the provider’s Media and Stakeholder analysis, they identified two separate events “centered around claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla’s Fremont factory, as well as its handling of the (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) investigation after multiple deaths and injuries were linked to its autopilot vehicles.”

As a result, its scores placed it in the bottom quartile of its sector, disqualifying it automatically from consideration.

“While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,” said Margaret Dorn, senior director and head of ESG Indices for North America.

Crude oil giant Exxon was among the 308 candidates included on the index, even though it is currently being probed by Massachusetts and New York over whether it to investors and the public regarding what it knew about climate change. A federal appeals court rejected Exxon's effort to halt the probe earlier this year.

Explanations why Exxon was chosen instead of Tesla were not provided by Dorn in the statement.

No coal or tobacco

According to the ratings agency, the ESG 500 is not inherently designed to offer an outperformance over S&P 500 — indeed just the opposite is the case.

It should maintain a risk and return profile similar to its own benchmark index, while simultaneously offering a distinct exposure to companies deemed more sustainable according to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Almost all sectors of the equity market are excluded from consideration, except ones such as thermal coal, tobacco and weapons manufacturing.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526961753619369987?s=20u0026t=w-uUFBoXGm_E1oRGLJGQpw

By not including a megacap like Tesla, however, there is now a potential risk that the two indices could diverge more than intended.

Tesla has not had the best experience with agencies like S&P. The latter waited so long to add Tesla to the broader S&P 500 index that the EV maker was worth half a trillion dollars before it was picked, prompting consideration of how it could possibly digest such a large first-time entrant.

Moreover, Tesla’s debt rating is still in junk territory even though it was highly profitable and generated just over $5 billion in excess cash last year.

""While Tesla and others may not have been included in the index this year, the beauty of the annual rebalance is that they will once again have an opportunity to be reviewed for inclusion in years to come,"" Dorn said.

649,Elon Musk lashes out after Tesla gets boot from ethical index,"Elon Musk lashes out after Tesla gets boot from ethical index

Elon Musk has accused a leading credit rating agency of being “phony social justice warriors” after Tesla was ejected from its ethical investing index.

S&P delisted Tesla from its environmental, social and governance (ESG) 500 index on Tuesday, blaming alleged racism at one of its factories and deaths linked to its Autopilot driver assistance technology.

Mr Musk hit back on Twitter by saying oil company Exxon was “rated top ten best in world for environment” in the same list Tesla has been removed from. Exxon, one of the world’s biggest oil companies, was accused in 2015 of withholding information from investors on the financial risks of climate change and conspiring to manipulate the public debate on greenhouse gases over a period of 40 years.

Mr Musk added: “@SPGlobalRatings has lost their integrity.”

Predicting that “political attacks on me will escalate dramatically in coming months”, the billionaire also posted an image saying ESG scores show “how compliant your business is with the leftist agenda”.

Margaret Dorn, of S&P, said: “While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider [environmental, social and governance] lens.”

The electric car manufacturer’s share price dipped 5pc on the news, down to $722 (£582).

S&P accused Tesla of lacking a formal low carbon strategy and said the firm was more exposed to risks from a future “controversial incident” when compared with similar companies.

S&P also cited alleged racial discrimination and “poor working conditions” at the company’s factory in Fremont, California.

A manager at Fremont would greet staff by saying “welcome to the slave house”, according to a legal claim filed in April by a black woman working at the plant.

Story continues

That claim followed a February case brought by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Officials accused Tesla of unfairly dismissing complaints of racism brought over a 10-year period.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment but has previously described the officials’ lawsuit as “unfair and counterproductive”, saying it relates to incidents from more than three years ago.

S&P also highlighted Tesla’s handling of a regulator’s investigation into deaths linked to its Autopilot driver assistance software.

A federal road safety agency opened an investigation into the carmaker’s Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in February after reports of “phantom braking” from drivers.

The software product, installed in Tesla cars as a standard feature, keeps the vehicle following the road while under human supervision.

“Current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous,” warns Tesla’s UK website.

650,Musk Mad Tesla Removed from S&amp;P 500 ESG Index,"Tesla ( ) CEO Elon Musk is extremely unhappy that the EV company was eliminated from the S&P 500 ESG Index on Wednesday, voicing his concerns on Twitter. The electric automaker was taken off the ESG index by S&P Dow Jones Indices due to Tesla's ongoing issues of racial discrimination claims from employees and how it has dealt with a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a government investigation after several crashes were connected to its autopilot vehicles. The changes are retroactive: they are effective May 2 and a May 17 S&P Dow Jones Indices blog post described the rationale.",2022-05-18T18:00:00+00:00
651,Why S&amp;P booted Tesla from its ESG index,"Tesla is no longer up to par with environmental, social and government standards — at least not those set forth by the S&P 500 ESG Index.

S&P Dow Jones Indices has removed electric-vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) from its sustainability benchmark as part of the index’s fourth annual rebalance after the Elon Musk-led company’s ESG rank slipped against its global peers, the index provider revealed in a Tuesday statement.

“While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,” Margaret Dorn, Head of ESG Indices at S&P Dow Jones said in a blog post.

Tesla’s overall ESG score has remained “fairly stable” year-over-year, according to S&P DJI. However, an increase in score for the broader industry group in which Tesla is categorized – Automobiles & Components – resulted Tesla's slide.

Musk, for his part, stated his disagreement with S&P's decision in a tweet on Wednesday, calling ESG “an outrageous scam.”

ESG is an outrageous scam! 

Shame on @SPGlobal

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request from Yahoo Finance for comment.

S&P Dow Jones Indices cited claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla’s flagship factory and its handling of a federal investigation into deaths linked to its autopilot vehicles in its decision to remove Tesla from the index.

Tesla has faced scrutiny in recent years over claims of poor working conditions at its Fremont, California factory, and Musk has voiced criticisms of efforts by some Tesla employees to unionize.

“There are a lot of folks who do not like the actions that Elon Musk takes, and there are a lot of problems with Tesla, including the way that they treat their employees on the factory floors,” Zach Stein, co-Founder of the sustainable investing platform Carbon Collective, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.

Story continues

Stein added, however, that it does not make sense to remove them from the index entirely. ""We wouldn't see the transition to electric vehicles at nearly the pace that we are seeing now without the work of Tesla,"" Stein said, also noting that ESG in general is a fundamentally opaque process.

“One way that we like to put it is, your friends are never going to be perfect, but you still have to work with them.”

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Meta Platforms (FB) were among other big-name companies that did not make the cut in S&P's latest reshuffle, while Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) are among the largest constituents of the index.

652,U.S. agency opens probe into fatal Tesla crash that killed three,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A special crash investigation has been opened into a fatal Tesla crash this month in California that resulted in three deaths, the U.S. transportation safety agency said on Wednesday.

The crash, involving a 2022 model Tesla Model S, is one of more than 30 under investigation by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) involving Tesla vehicles in which advanced driver assistance systems like Autopilot were suspected of being used.

A total of 14 crash deaths have been reported in those Tesla investigations, including the most recent three.

Of the 35 special crash investigations by the NHTSA into Tesla since 2016 involving advanced driver assistance systems, Autopilot use has been ruled out in three.

NHTSA separately said on Wednesday that in April it had opened another special crash investigation involving a 2016 Tesla Model X in Florida that resulted in a minor injury.

NHTSA did not immediately identify the crash that killed three in the new probe but the Orange County Register https://www.ocregister.com/2022/05/12/3-killed-and-car-that-slammed-into-construction-equipment-in-newport-beach reported a May 12 Tesla Model S crash killed three occupants and injured three workers were when it struck construction equipment along Pacific Coast Highway in Newport Beach.

Tesla's Autopilot and other driver assistance systems are coming under increased scrutiny. Tesla says on its website that Autopilot enables vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically but ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

In August, NHTSA said it opened a formal preliminary evaluation into Autopilot and has identified at least a dozen crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles. That investigation is still pending.

Pixabay/Public Domain Let's look at why these stocks are declining today and discuss how hedge funds are positioned in them.

10. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) has lost 24.11% of its value as of 11:50 AM ET after the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based big-box retailer revealed that its quarterly bottom line was adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions, increase in fuel costs, and lower than anticipated sales of discretionary goods like bicycles and TV. This caused Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) to miss its EPS estimate for the quarter and report the biggest one-day decline in the stock price in over three decades. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) maintained its mid-single-digit revenue growth guidance but did not share an EPS forecast for this year after falling to a new 52-week low during trading today.

Out of the 924 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey, 49 funds held a stake in Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) as of Q4 2021.

9. Lowe's Companies, Inc (NYSE:LOW) is 4.75% in the red as of 11:50 AM ET after the North Carolina-based home improvement retailer failed to surpass top-line estimates for the quarter as cooler spring weather caused people to abandon outdoor do-it-yourself (DIY) projects.

However, the company maintained its annual revenue guidance of $97 billion to $99 billion. The results reported by Lowe's Companies are in contrast to what Home Depot, Inc.

(NYSE:DNA) and the synthetic biology industry.

654,"Google to pull nearly all employees from Russia, Tesla booted from S&amp;P 500 ESG index, TJX stock pops","Yahoo Finance Live looks at the companies tied to several trending industry stories, including Elon Musk's reaction to Tesla being removed from the S&P 500 ESG index.

Video Transcript

RACHELLE AKUFFO: As we take a look at our triple play picks now, a lot of our stocks being affected by the broad declines that we're seeing in the market today. My pick to kick us off, though, is Google. The company announcing that it's moved nearly all of its employees out of Russia in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. As you can see there, Alphabet down about 3 and 1/2% on the day. Now, according to the ""Wall Street Journal,"" this effectively ends its subsidiary business there for the foreseeable future.

Now, Google's Russian subsidiary is also filing for bankruptcy. That's after the Russian court froze their main bank account and removed the funds, leaving Google unable to pay their staff. Now, Russian authorities say they don't plan to block Google services, which, of course, include their search engine, Maps, Gmail, and YouTube. But this move does come as McDonald's also announced it's selling all of its restaurants and operations in Russia earlier this week.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Rachelle, Google really just becoming the latest Western company here to pull out of Russia, with plans to pull out of Russia. Like you just said, McDonald's announced plans to sell their Russian business to a local buyer. We had Nike and Adidas, just two of the retail names. A number of names in the financial sector, American Express, Deutsche Bank among those, that are changing how they do business in the country. So I'm sure that Google will not be the last that we hear of companies changing their strategy or pulling out altogether when it comes to doing business in Russia.

I wanted to take a look at TJX because we are talking a lot about the massive sell-off that's going on right now on Wall Street. But the parent company of TJ Maxx is actually bucking that downward trend. You can see the stock is getting a nice boost today on the heels of actually mixed earnings. But investors, they're excited about the stronger margin performance that the company posted. They posted double digit percentage growth in earnings and also revenue during its first quarter, sending its shares surging today. You can see the stock up just over 6%.

Story continues

Earlier today, in earlier trading, it was actually up more than 10%, which is the biggest intraday jump that we have seen for TJX since November. But Dave, we talk a lot about these retail plays, so questioning whether or not they are going to get hit significantly by inflation. At least with this report, they did warn of potentially slowing sales going forward, but this report, investors finding a reason to get excited because of that stronger margin than we were initially expecting.

DAVE BRIGGS: Actually, I thought more would be made of the forecast, downgrading that, as you said, from 3% to 4%-- 2%, between 1% and 2%, but that was not a problem. And to offset those costs, they said they were able to survive the increased costs due to solid pricing and reduced COVID costs and much better international profits, so nice to have a silver lining in the retail sector. Thank you for that.

You know what time it is for me. It's the Musk Minute, my time to talk about Elon Musk. And my play is Tesla. They were given the boot today. Not that lock on your tire for too many tickets, but they've actually been kicked out of the S&P 500 ESG Index. The S&P explained the decision in a blog post, saying Tesla's, quote, ""lack of low carbon strategy, codes of business conduct, along with racism and poor working conditions"" reported at Tesla's factory in Fremont impacted their score. No comment from Elon Musk. I'm just kidding, of course.

He went nuts on Twitter. He called the decision BS. He labeled the metrics, ""the devil incarnate."" He said that the ratings lost their integrity. And he added an ESG-themed meme for good measure. Shares of Tesla struggling, this year down 40%, slipped another 5% plus today in the selloff. Rachelle, it's just been flat out ugly out there. And Elon Musk, no containing this man on social media.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, hey, the man says he's a proponent of free speech. Apparently, no matter what it costs him, he's willing to put that out there. But I mean, we have seen a lot of these whistleblower comments, like some people wondering about treatment at some of these Tesla plants. So obviously, free speech cuts both ways. Obviously, we'll have to wait and see if these things are investigated and how it plays out. But once again, Elon Musk not doing himself any favors by continuing to use this public form of Twitter to react to every single thing versus perhaps going through the legal channels and making sure that it doesn't affect the stock prices of some of the companies that he's heading.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, he never sits back. He doesn't wait for anything anyone else to chime in or anyone else to have an opinion before he likes to get his voice out there. And we know that that has been so consistent, whether or not he's dealing with Tesla, whether he's dealing with SpaceX. Now, when it comes to Twitter, he doesn't hold back. And I think that today's reaction didn't take anyone by surprise. But it was an interesting move here, the fact that Tesla has been removed from the ESG Index and really highlighting some of the issues that the company has dealt with or some of the issues that have been created at Tesla over the last several years.

DAVE BRIGGS: Wouldn't it be nice if he had no comment, just once?

SEANA SMITH: It would be so nice, so nice. He's never at a loss for words.

DAVE BRIGGS: He also weighed into politics in a podcast earlier this week, and then he jumped on Twitter and clarified. He said, I really have not been voting for Republicans at all in recent years. I really have voted almost all the time for Democrats, but then said, I will vote for Republicans in these midterms. Rachelle, do you believe that he's never been voting Republican?

RACHELLE AKUFFO: You know, hey, he's not one to sort of hold back in terms of how he feels and what he does.

DAVE BRIGGS: True.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: So you kind of almost have to take him at face value. I mean, probably, a lot of people are wondering, if a deal goes through, if that's, perhaps, going to affect the algorithm, if that's going to affect the number of conservative voices that perhaps outweigh the liberal voices, or will it be completely a level playing field? But once again, never one to hold back, is Elon Musk.",2022-05-18T19:47:25+00:00

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has done really well for itself in the automotive industry, positioning itself as a leader in the electric vehicle (EV) sector.

Tesla’s success story can be attributed to Elon Musk, who became its chief executive officer in 2008 after co-founding PayPal with Peter Thiel. Musk built Tesla’s reputation by investing in different projects, including SpaceX.

Cathie Wood has been a long-time supporter of Tesla. It occupies the top spot for her ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK). While ARK sold around 15,000 Tesla shares from its fund, it still is a sizeable position in its overall holdings.

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - A special crash investigation has been opened into a fatal Tesla crash this month in California that resulted in three deaths, the U.S. transportation safety agency said on Wednesday.

The crash, involving a 2022 model Tesla Model S, is one of more than 30 under investigation by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) involving Tesla vehicles in which advanced driver assistance systems like Autopilot were suspected of being used.

A total of 14 crash deaths have been reported in those Tesla investigations, including the most recent three.

Of the 35 special crash investigations by the NHTSA into Tesla since 2016 involving advanced driver assistance systems, Autopilot use has been ruled out in three.

NHTSA separately said on Wednesday that in April it had opened another special crash investigation involving a 2016 Tesla Model X in Florida that resulted in a minor injury.

NHTSA did not immediately identify the crash that killed three in the new probe but the Orange County Register https://www.ocregister.com/2022/05/12/3-killed-and-car-that-slammed-into-construction-equipment-in-newport-beach reported a May 12 Tesla Model S crash killed three occupants and injured three workers were when it struck construction equipment along Pacific Coast Highway in Newport Beach.

Tesla's Autopilot and other driver assistance systems are coming under increased scrutiny. Tesla says on its website that Autopilot enables vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically but ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

In August, NHTSA said it opened a formal preliminary evaluation into Autopilot and has identified at least a dozen crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles. That investigation is still pending. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler and Grant McCool)",2022-05-18T20:44:53+00:00

665,Column: Why don't regulators stop Elon Musk from breaking the law?,"Elon Musk doesn't care about your little rules. (Associated Press)

In his takeover adventure with Twitter, it seems more likely than not that Elon Musk has broken the law.

In some respects, his lawbreaking is easily documented. According to Musk's own disclosure, his purchases of Twitter shares brought him to 5% ownership of the company stock on March 14.

Securities law requires that any such holding be divulged publicly and to the Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days, or in this case by March 24; Musk didn't make the disclosure until April 4, which was 11 days late.

My frank opinion is that the harm from the coronavirus panic far exceeds that of the virus itself.

Elon Musk in 2020, before U.S. COVID deaths reached 1 million

In financial terms, the consequences weren't trivial: By our calculations, the delay might have saved Musk more than $170 million in his Twitter purchases. To put it another way, he may have rooked the Twitter stockholders whose shares he bought out of $170 million.

This wouldn't be the first time Musk has run roughshod over laws or regulations. In the past, he has flouted not only securities rules but other public regulations as well, such as public health rules concerning the pandemic and rules regarding the safe operation of self-driving technologies on public roads.

Up to now, the general public reaction to this behavior has been limited to a bemused shaking of the head and the thought: ""How does he get away with it?"" But that's the wrong framing of the issue. The right framing is: ""Why do the authorities let him get away with it?""

Time and time again, Musk has gotten his way with regulators and municipal officials through bluster and intimidation. He's often backed by fans who make their support known en masse via social media, creating the impression that the voting public generally wants Musk to be left alone.

Authorities seldom use their maximum enforcement powers against Musk. In a case involving a plainly misleading 2018 tweet about his intention to take his Tesla electric vehicle company private at a premium price, the SEC penalized Musk and Tesla $20 million each.

Story continues

In the context of his personal wealth, which is estimated at about $219 billion based on the value of his Tesla stock, that's a wrist-slap. The SEC, if it wishes, could move to hit him with a lifetime ban from association with a publicly traded company.

That would be exceptionally harsh — the agency didn't impose the so-called bad boy penalty in cases involving banks complicit in the 2008 financial crash, and it is seldom even contemplated except when an executive is convicted of a felony. But it's on the books. In any event, the SEC's ability to impose much more stringent penalties on Musk than it has thus far is clear.

Musk has been enormously successful at creating the impression that everything he does is for the greater good of humanity, whether it's building the market for electric vehicles or finding a way to transfer human society to Mars.

If this were indisputably true, it might warrant giving him a little legal leeway, but by no means the broad indulgence that officials have allowed him.

Among the adversaries that Musk has browbeaten, count the board of Twitter. The board responded to Musk's disclosure of a 9.2% stake in April by reaching an agreement for him to take a board seat. He then refused the board seat and issued an offer to take over the company for $54.20 a share. The board quickly agreed.

But now Musk is acting as though he wants to bail out on the deal, leaving the Twitter board with few options: They could accept the $1-billion breakup fee written into the takeover contract, or try to force him to complete the deal on the agreed-upon terms.

Neither option would make the board look smart or even professional. That's part of Musk's secret — he gives his adversaries the impression that they have no choice but to give him what he wants.

Musk isn't the first entrepreneur, high-tech or otherwise, to act as though traditional rules and regulations don't apply to him.

Uber co-founder and former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick polished the technique to a high luster: When local officials tried to regulate or block his ride-hailing company's entry into their markets, he browbeat them with the accusation that they were standing in the way of a revolution that would bring cheap and reliable transportation to the people.

Often, the regulators backed down. In California, the Public Utilities Commission carved out a regulatory exception for Uber and Lyft, blocking local initiatives aimed at equalizing ride-hailing regulations with those of taxis, the drivers of which were generally subject to more stringent background checks and vehicle inspections than ride-hailing drivers.

The idea that the PUC could step in and oversee the companies' activities was nothing but a mirage. As former PUC President Michael Picker eventually acknowledged, ride-hail regulation was not “something we can do effectively.”

As for the ostensibly indisputable benefits and virtues of the ride-hailing revolution, they're also highly illusory. Studies have found that when Uber and Lyft enter a market, their fleets are more polluting than autos on average; contribute to more traffic congestion, particularly in the central cities; undermine public transit systems; and devastate the local taxi industry.

Authorities who capitulated to Kalanickian's bluster may have figured that if they yielded a bit on Uber's demands, the company and its fellows in the gig economy would become model citizens. That approach never works. Instead, years of indulgent treatment (along with tens of billions of capital from venture investors) provided the companies with enough money to rewrite California labor law in their own interest.

Musk adheres to the tradition of taking legal and regulatory forbearance as an inducement and invitation to demand more. The Economist described his viewpoint succinctly: ""He paints stewards of fair play — regulators and boards — as pettifogging enemies of progress,"" wrote its pseudonymous business columnist ""Schumpeter.""

The evidence suggests that regulators have leaned over backward to satisfy Musk. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, for example, has consistently failed to hold Musk's electric vehicle company to the same standards for autonomous driving technology as it does other robot car developers.

Among other breaks given Tesla, as my colleague Russ Mitchell has documented, the company hasn't been required to report crashes and system failures associated with the Full Self-Driving iteration of its Autopilot feature to the DMV. Unlike competitors such as Waymo, Cruise, Argo and Zoox, Tesla allows its program to be tested on public roads by untrained drivers.

The harvest has been a flood of YouTube and Twitter posts showing Teslas driving into oncoming traffic, mistaking railroad tracks for paved streets and aiming themselves into metal posts and traffic barriers.

Tesla even briefly added a “rolling stop” feature that allowed cars equipped with the program to roll past stop signs without coming to a full stop. The company removed the feature after an uproar ensued.

In January, the California DMV said it would reassess its tolerant treatment of Tesla's self-driving testing. This is the opposite of the proactive approach that motorists should expect its regulators to take toward technical innovations that present manifest hazards to the public.

It is, however, similar to the approach of federal regulators such as the National Transportation Safety Board, which has been similarly lenient. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy, a Biden appointee, last October publicly questioned why Tesla had been allowed to ignore the board's 2017 safety recommendation for driver-assistance programs for years.

The board had made the recommendation to Tesla and five other companies with such programs, Homendy said in a letter addressed to Musk. ""Tesla is the only manufacturer that did not officially respond to us about the recommendation,"" she wrote.

Meanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has 10 deaths potentially associated with Tesla programs under investigation. These actions, also, are reactive rather than proactive. How many deaths must be investigated before the regulator stops allowing Tesla's program to be deployed in public?

During the pandemic, Musk took the attitude that the danger of COVID-19 had been exaggerated and that public health measures that affected his company were unwarranted. In March 2020, Tesla's Fremont, Calif., factory continued operating despite an order from Alameda County authorities that it be shut down in compliance with anti-pandemic policies.

""My frank opinion is that the harm from the coronavirus panic far exceeds that of the virus itself,” Musk wrote in a message to employees. He predicted that COVID-19 cases “will not exceed 0.1% of the population.” In the U.S., cases have reached about 25% of the population, and deaths alone have reached 0.3%.

Alameda authorities soon backed down, allowing the Fremont plant to continue operating. The plant emerged as a local hotspot for COVID infections, with more than 400 cases recorded between May and December 2020 among its 10,000 workers.

Then there's the relationship between the SEC and Musk. The agency took action against Musk in 2018 over his tweet declaring that he was intending to take Tesla private for $420 per share, a substantial premium over its price at the time. The tweet said funding for the transaction was “secured.”

In fact, there was no funding, and Musk had taken no significant steps toward any such deal. His tweet set off a brief trading frenzy in Tesla stock.

The agency and Musk eventually settled the agency's lawsuit over the tweet with a deal requiring Musk and Tesla each to pay a penalty of $20 million, and for Musk to step down from his position as Tesla chairman. He was permitted to remain as CEO.

His future tweets about Tesla were to be reviewed by company lawyers before they could be posted, the settlement mandated. Musk did not deny the agency's allegations that he had violated securities laws.

Yet Musk continued to issue tweets that appeared to violate the deal, prompting the agency to return to court to make its terms crystal clear. The SEC may have thought that would settle the matter, but it didn't. Last November, Musk tweeted about possibly selling a sizable portion of his Tesla shares, without clearing the tweets in advance.

The SEC subpoenaed records related to the tweets, prompting Musk to ask a judge to invalidate the original deal on the claim that he had been coerced into signing it. The judge refused.

Musk's purported deal to buy Twitter and take the company private is chock full of the same in-and-out running. When he finally disclosed his share buying on April 4, he did so on a form reserved for passive investors, those with no intention of controlling the target company.

At the time, however, according to a disclosure filed by Twitter on Tuesday, he already had told Twitter's chairman and CEO ""that he was considering various options with respect to his ownership, including potentially joining the Twitter Board, seeking to take Twitter private or starting a competitor to Twitter.""

More recently, Musk has been signaling that he may not want to acquire Twitter after all, raising a manifestly thin excuse for putting the transaction ""on hold."" Whichever way you cut, at least some of Musk's comments have been fundamentally misleading.

These are by no means victimless offenses. Tesla shares soared by about 6% shortly after his taking-private tweet, which meant that at least some buyers were fooled into overpaying. Then there's Musk's delayed disclosure of his Twitter share purchases. In the trades between the date Musk was required to disclose his purchases and the day he finally did so, he acquired 13.1 million shares for about $513.2 million, or an average of about $39.05 each. Twitter closed at $36.86 Wednesday.

On April 5, the day after he disclosed, Twitter shares rose to about $51, based at least partially on investor enthusiasm about his interest in the company. Had he made a timely disclosure and shares hit that level on March 25, he would have spent about $670.2 million for the same shares, or about $157 million more.

Obviously, it's impossible to do more than conjecture about what Twitter's price would be between March 25 and April 4 if Musk disclosed as required, but it's reasonable to say that he saved a bundle by delaying his disclosure, and Twitter shareholders, for whom his buying plainly was of material interest, made that much less.

Musk's maneuvering over Twitter could be the high-water mark of his manipulative method. If the deal falls through, it could be harder for any potential partner to take him at his word. But more important is the corrosive effect Musk's actions have had on the rule of law and principles of fair dealing.

If he's allowed to skate on his evident violations of securities law and reckless treatment of the market, then more billionaires who care only about their own level of self-esteem will feel even freer to take advantage of the rest of us.

Tesla Inc., meanwhile, sank to the lowest level this year, wiping $12.3 billion from his wealth, while Twitter further extended its slide. All told, Musk has lost $49 billion since launching his bid for Twitter last month, partly as the wider market tumbled and as some investors in Tesla grew concerned over how he’d fund his offer for the social-media giant.

Musk, 50, remains the world’s richest person, with a fortune of $209.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s shaved $60.4 billion off his wealth this year, trailing only Binance’s Changpeng Zhao, who’s down $81 billion, and Jeff Bezos’s $62 billion drop.

Musk has grown increasingly vocal since launching his $44 billion offer for Twitter. Wednesday was no exception.

He tweeted that ESG was “a scam” after Tesla lost its spot on an S&P Global index that tracks companies on their environmental, social and governance standards. He also predicted that “political attacks” on him would “escalate dramatically in coming months.”

In a separate tweet, Musk said he’d supported Democrats in the past because “they were (mostly) the kindness party,” but has now changed his mind.

“They have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican,” he said.

669,Will CARZ ETF Gain Despite Mixed Auto Earnings?,"The automobile sector came up with mixed results this reporting season. 66.7% of the S&P automobile companies beat on earnings while 100% surpassed on revenues. Moreover, earnings rose 22.4% year over year while revenues increased 20.6%, as indicated by the Earnings Trends issued on May 11.

The U.S. automobile sector has been gaining investor attention of late as the gradual resumption of U.S. and global economic activities highlights brighter prospects. Vehicle demand saw a boost, courtesy of the growing inclination toward personal mobility and easier credit conditions. Electric vehicles (EVs) are seeing greater popularity with each passing day and are likely to brighten the prospects of automakers.

However, the latest disappointing preliminary consumer sentiment readings for early May are bearing the brunt of persistently high inflation levels. The University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment declined 9.4% from the prior-month level to 59.1 in early May (the lowest reading since August 2011). The metric lagged the market forecast of the index coming in at 64, per a Reuters’ poll.

Consumers are upset about the buying conditions for durable manufactured goods, which they consider the worst since the survey began tracking the series in 1978, per a Reuters article.

The consumer spending levels are, however, expected to remain high, mainly owing to the considerable amount of savings done during the pandemic.

Against this backdrop, we look at some big automobile earnings releases and check if these can impact ETFs exposed to the sector.

Automobile ETF in Focus

Given the current scenario, it is prudent to discuss the following ETF that has relatively higher exposure to the major players in the space:

First Trust S-Network Future Vehicles & Technology ETF CARZ

The investment objective of First Trust S-Network Future Vehicles & Technology ETF is to seek investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield (before the Fund's fees and expenses) of an equity index called the S-Network Electric & Future Vehicle Ecosystem Index.

First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF comprises 102 holdings. CARZ’s AUM is $56.5 million while its expense ratio, 0.70%. First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF currently carries a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a High-risk outlook.

Earnings in Focus

Tesla TSLA is the market leader in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States, owning around 60% of the market share. In fact, the company’s flagship Model 3 accounts for about half of the U.S. EV market. On Apr 20, Tesla reported earnings per share of $3.22 for first-quarter 2022, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15.  The outperformance was led by higher-than-expected deliveries and automotive gross profit, which came in at $5.54 billion, outpacing the consensus mark of $4.11 billion.  The earnings figure also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s 93 cents. Revenues rose to $18.76 billion, surpassing the consensus mark of $17.28 billion. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 80.5%. During the first quarter, TSLA reported delivery and production of 310,048 and 305,407 vehicles each, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 68% and 69%, respectively.

Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $17.51 billion as of Mar 31, 2022, compared with $17.58 billion as of Dec 31, 2021.

Ford Motor Company F designs, manufactures, markets and services cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles. On Apr 27, F reported first-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. Lower-than-expected profits in North America and a wider-than-expected pretax loss in China might have caused this underperformance. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported earnings of 89 cents.

During the reported quarter, Ford reported automotive revenues of $32.10 billion, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.10 billion and dipped 4% year over year. Ford had cash and cash equivalents of $10.58 billion as of Mar 31, 2022, compared with $10.96 billion on Dec 31, 2021.

One of the world’s largest automakers, General Motors GM reported first-quarter 2022 earnings results on Apr 26. GM reported adjusted earnings of $2.09 per share for first-quarter 2022, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. Stronger-than-expected profits from its North America, International and Financial segments led to this outperformance. The bottom line, however, compares unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.25 per share. GM reported revenues worth $35.98 billion, up from the year-ago figure of $32.47 billion. However, the revenue figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.25 billion.

General Motors had cash and cash equivalents of $16.35 billion as of Mar 31, 2022, compared with $20.07 billion at the end of 2021. GM recorded an adjusted automotive free cash flow (FCF) of $6 billion for first-quarter 2022 against a negative cash flow of $1.93 billion in the year-ago period.

It’s been a bumpy road for electric vehicle (EV) stocks this year. As the market has fallen lower, shares of electric vehicle makers have been among the most battered and bruised.

Established companies to start-ups have seen their share prices fall 40% or more in recent months as investors move away from speculative stocks that are viewed as risky. Instead, investors are seeking safe haven assets instead.

The selloff in EV stocks could worsen in coming months as high inflation forces consumers to put off discretionary purchases, such as a new vehicle, and rising interest rates make it more expensive for capital-intensive industries, such as automakers, to finance their operations. Throw in global supply chain problems and a war in Europe, and it becomes clear just how potentially risky investing in electric vehicle stocks is right now.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the world’s dominant electric vehicle maker — for now. While the company currently boasts a 20% share of worldwide EV sales, competition is heating up and coming from all corners. Established automakers ranging from Ford (NYSE:F) to Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) are ramping up production of electric vehicles in an effort to dethrone Tesla.

At the same time, the company continues to be hobbled by ongoing production problems in China, where Covid-19 restrictions have slowed production at the company’s Shanghai plant to 200 cars a day, which is a fraction of the normal 2,600 electric vehicles produced daily at the site. Plus, there are growing concerns that CEO Elon Musk’s is distracted by plans to buy Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and other adventures.

Year to date, TSLA stock is down 30% at $733 per share. Things might get worse before they get better.

Rivian’s (NASDAQ:RIVN) major investors are dumping the company’s stock. News has just broke that auto giant Ford has sold another seven million Rivian shares worth $188.42 million. This latest sale comes days after Ford sold $214 million worth of RIVN stock, bringing the total amount offloaded by Ford to more than $400 million in the past week.

Ford’s sale came after the lock-up period expired on Rivian’s stock following the electric vehicle start-up’s initial public offering (IPO) last fall. Ford, along with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are the two largest shareholders in RIVN stock. For its part, Amazon said when releasing its first-quarter results that it took a $7.6 billion loss on its stake in Rivian after the EV company’s share price fell by more than 50% in the first three months of this year. That swung Amazon to a rare quarterly net loss.

The 7 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy Now

So far this year, RIVN stock is down 73% at about $28 a share. News that Ford is continuing to sell shares has put additional pressure on Rivian’s stock.

Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) has had some good news lately, including receiving a big order for its electric vehicles from the Government of Saudi Arabia. However, the good news can’t hide the fact that Lucid has struggled to increase its production amid global supply chain problems that are making it difficult to source parts.

Earlier this year, Lucid lowered its full-year guidance for production of between 12,000 to 14,000 vehicles from 20,000 vehicles previously. That downgrade helped prompt the current selloff in LCID stock that has accelerated in recent months. The company’s stock is now down 53% year to date at about $18 a share.

Add in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into the company’s IPO last summer, and a class action lawsuit by investors who feel they’ve been mislead about the company’s production capacity, and there is a lot of uncertainty around Lucid Group.

Manhattan Beach, California-based Fisker (NYSE:FSR) has been touting that it now has more than 45,000 reservations for its fully electric SUV called the “Ocean.” However, the company has yet to put any of its electric vehicles into production. Right now, we currently have promises that the Ocean SUV will enter production by the end of this year with help from manufacturing partner, Magna International (NYSE:MGA).

However, before the first Ocean vehicles roll off the assembly line, Fisker’s management team is already promising to increase production capacity from a planned 50,000 annually to three times that amount by the end of next year (2023). Investors sniffing around this company will want to separate the hype from reality.

Already down 29.5% this year to $11.09 a share, FSR stock will surely fall further if there are any production delays with its electric SUV.

It’s also worth noting that Fisker has gone bankrupt in the past. Originally founded in 2007, the automaker went bankrupt in 2013 before returning to public markets in its current form in 2020.

Even among electric vehicle makers, shares of Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) are highly speculative and trading deep in penny stock territory at $2.26 a share. The company had been struggling to raise capital and continue operations before recently selling its Ohio manufacturing plant to Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn. That sale gave Lordstown Motors $260 million in much needed cash.

Lordstown Motors said the sale to Foxconn will enable it to move forward with production of its long-delayed Endurance electric pick-up truck. However, despite earning $260 million in cash from the Foxconn deal, Lordstown said it still needs to raise an additional $150 million to put its Endurance electric pick-up truck into full production. Where that additional money will come from remains to be seen.

In the past six months, RIDE stock has declined 28%. Over the past year, the stock has fallen 70.5%.

ChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint (CHPT) charging station.

ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) isn’t an electric vehicle manufacturer in the same way the other stocks on this list are. The Campbell, California-based company makes public charging stations that are needed to recharge electric vehicles. They must become as commonplace as gas stations on roads and highways if EV adoption is to really takeoff around the world.

While governments, including the U.S., continue to funnel infrastructure dollars at ChargePoint and other electric vehicle charging companies in an effort to stimulate their growth and expansion, the money and incentives have had limited impact.

7 Safe Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Now

This helps to account for the fact that CHPT stock has pulled back 45% so far in 2022 to trade at just $10.50 a share. The stock is now down 71.5% from its 52-week high of $36.86 reached last June.

Nio (NYSE:NIO) is considered the EV leader in China, but its stock has been clobbered in recent months amid concerns about its production and expansion, as well as the future of its U.S. listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Shanghai automaker announced earlier in May that it plans to pursue a secondary listing of its shares in Singapore, as regulatory scrutiny puts the company’s New York listing in doubt. Such a delisting would not be good for American shareholders.

Nio’s stock plunged 15% in a single day in early May after the company revealed that the SEC is investigating it over an accounting problem. The SEC has the authority to suspend NIO stock from trading on the big board in New York if it concludes that such an action is warranted upon further investigation. That prospect has many investors spooked. So far in 2022, NIO stock has plunged 49% to $16 a share.

673,"Cisco Plunges After China Lockdowns, Ukraine Wreck Forecast","(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. tumbled as much as 19% in late trading after warning of a sales decline in the current quarter and slashing its annual forecast, blaming disruptions stemming from Chinese lockdowns and the Ukraine war.

Sales will dip 1% to 5.5% in the period ending in July, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts had predicted growth of nearly 6%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cisco’s earnings forecast also was short of Wall Street predictions.

Makers of tech equipment have already been struggling with chip shortages, and supply snags triggered by China’s Covid-19 lockdowns and the Ukraine conflict have only added to their woes. Cisco, the biggest maker of computer-networking equipment, has struggled to fill all the orders it has been given.

“While Covid lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine impacted our revenue in the quarter, the fundamental drivers across our business are strong and we remain confident in the long term,” Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said in the statement.

Like many tech companies, Cisco began cutting ties with Russia after that country invaded Ukraine earlier this year. The company said Wednesday that stopping business in Russia and its ally Belarus cost it about $200 million in revenue during the fiscal third quarter. Historically the region, including Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine, has accounted for about 1% of total sales.

Cisco shares tumbled as low as $39 in late trading. The stock had fallen 24% to $48.36 this year through the close Wednesday. Other networking related-companies saw their stocks fall after hours following Cisco’s report. Juniper Networks Inc. was down as much as 9.6%, Broadcom Corp. fell as much as 4.3% and Ciena Corp. dropped as much as 12%.

Story continues

On a conference call with Cisco executives, analysts questioned whether the weak guidance indicated that customers are concerned about their own future prospects and have begun to cut their spending.

Robbins insisted that Cisco’s problem is purely supply-related and that demand remains robust. That said, the company doesn’t expect shortages to be resolved in the current quarter.

The inability to get power supplies from China cost Cisco $300 million in revenue in the third quarter, executives said. And when the lockdowns end in China, the problem won’t be solved right away.

“Even though these top-line numbers don’t look good, there’s a very simple explanation,” Robbins said on the call. “Customers are not signaling any real shift at this point. There’s no reflection of demand issues in our guidance.”

Even so, the report was a stark contrast from three months ago, when Cisco said orders rose more than 30% for a third consecutive quarter. Since then, investors have become more concerned that inflation and fears of slowing economic growth will make customers more cautious. This past quarter, the company said it orders increased 8%.

While that’s a much slower rate of expansion, it shows strong growth ahead for a company of Cisco’s size, according to David Heger, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co.

“I would be more concerned if that order number was flat or down,” Heger said. “Short of some big drop off in demand, it seems as though the market is overcompensating.”

Cisco has implemented a no-cancellation policy on its orders within 45 days of the shipping date, according to Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren. Smaller customers, who tend to be the quickest to tighten their spending budgets, increased orders 19%. The growth and the overall low rate of cancellations give the company confidence that there are no underlying demand issues, Herren said in an interview.

Under Robbins, Cisco has been trying to spur growth with updated hardware, as well as new services and software. The hope is to make the longtime king of networking gear less dependent on one-time equipment sales.

The latest outlook marks a setback in that push. Excluding certain items, earnings will be 76 cents to 84 cents a share in the period, Cisco said. That compares with an average estimate of 92 cents.

For the year, revenue will grow 2% to 3%, the company said, compared with a previous prediction of as much as 6.5%.

Revenue in the three months ended in April, was $12.8 billion, little changed from a year ago. Earnings per share, minus certain items, was 87 cents. Analysts had projected a profit of 86 cents on sales of $13.3 billion on average.

The disruptive EV industry is in part driven by environmental concerns. As required by the Paris Agreement, many countries have agreed to bring their greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels to zero by 2050. Recent metrics form the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggest that transportation is the biggest source of GHG with a 27% share. InvestorPlace.com readers should know that petroleum-based fluids, like gasoline and diesel, comprise roughly 90% of the energy source in transportation.

In addition to environmental initiatives, the current war in Ukraine has put alternative energy sources and EVs in the limelight. Energy costs have been soaring in recent months. Although the situation is not as the tragic gas shortages in the 70s, today’s disturbance in Eastern Europe has put considerable stress on oil supply and prices.

According to Allied Market Research: “The global electric vehicle market was valued at $163.01 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $823.75 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 18.2% from 2021 to 2030.”

Yet, despite the potential growth in the sector,  the S&P Kensho Electric Vehicles Index is down by 32.7% year-to date (YTD) and 33.4% over a 12 month period. Therefore, many electric vehicle stocks offer better value now.

Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) provides charging equipment and services. In other words, although it does not manufacture EVs, it still holds an important place in the industry.

Blink Charging released first quarter (Q1) results on May 9. Revenue came in at a record high of $9.8 million with a 339% increase year-over-year (YOY). Net loss for the quarter was 36 cents per share compared to 18 cents for Q1 FY21. Cash and marketable securities totaled $161.9 million as of Mar. 31.

Management believes the company is on track to grow operations worldwide. After acquiring Electric Blue in the U.K., the company is now present in 19 countries including the U.S., U.K., Belgium, Greece and nine countries in Latin America.

Despite the growth in revenue, BLNK stock is down by 38.1% YTD and 52% over a 12-month period. Meanwhile, shares are trading at 29.2 times sales. At present, the 12-month median price forecast for BLNK stands at $25.

The next stock on the list, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), is a major player in China’s EV market. It relies on its proprietary internal combustion engine range extender to appeal to a wider customer base. Li Auto is among the top 10 EV manufacturers in China, which tops the list of GHG emissions

Domestic Chinese policies encourage drivers to choose EVs for their next car purchase. Recent research by Mordor Intelligence suggests that the national market could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 30% between 2022 and 2027.

Li Auto announced unaudited Q1 results on May 10. Revenue came in at 9.31 billion RMB — or $1.47 billion — up 168.7% from 3.46 billion RMB a year ago. Meanwhile, non-GAAP diluted loss per share was 7 cents. Free cash flow (FCF) came in at $79.2 million.

In Q2, management expects to deliver between 21,000 and 24,000 vehicles. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic resurging in China, investors are looking forward to the launch the new line L9 in Q3.

LI stock is down by 17.6% YTD, but up 20% over a 12-month period. Shares are changing hands at 4.32 times sales. Meanwhile, the 12-month median price forecast for Li Auto is $33.36.

This third EV stock, Nio (NYSE:NIO), also comes from China. It differentiates itself with battery swapping and autonomous driving technologies.

Nio released Q4 FY21 unaudited results on Mar. 24. Total revenue came in at 9,900.7 million RMB — or $1,553.6 million —  up 49.3% YOY. Adjusted diluted net loss was 16 cents per share. Cash and equivalents totaled $2,406 million.

Management noted that the deliveries for the ES8, ES6 and EC6 totaled 9,652 vehicles in January and 6,131 vehicles in February, up 33.6% and 9.9% YOY, respectively.

InvestorPlace.com readers will remember that the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has added dozens companies to a list of companies that could face expulsion from U.S. exchanges. The list comprises mostly Chinese companies, including Nio, as well as its rivals, Li Auto and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV).

As a result, NIO stock has lost almost 50% YTD. Shares are trading at 3.91 times forward sales and the 12-month median price forecast for Nio stock stands at $30.87.

Next up is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), possibly the most famous EV manufacturer. This EV pioneer has disrupted the traditional automotive industry, encouraging other players to include EVs in their product lines.

Tesla reported Q1 results in early April. Revenue came in at $18,75 billion, up 81% YOY. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22, up 246% from the year-ago period. FCF was $2.2 billion.

Despite global supply chain issues, management is keen on increasing capacity. In order to overcome some of these obstacles, Tesla is producing and recycling required parts and materials.

Along with most other EV shares, TSLA stock is down 29% YTD, but still up 16.46% over a 12-month period. Shares are trading at 61.7 times forward earnings and 14.37 times forward sales. The current 12-month median price forecast for Tesla stock is $1,125.

Best Electric Vehicle Stocks: Workhorse (WKHS) Image of a Workhorse (WKHS stock) logo and drone on the side of a truck.

The final EV stock on our list is Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS). Its products include delivery trucks and drones for the commercial transportation sector. We must remind readers that Workshorse is still a pre-revenue EV name.

Workhorse reported Q1 results on May 10. Net loss was $22.1 million. Cash and equivalents totaled $167 million. During the quarter, it opened a new design center in Wixom, Michigan to enhance engineering capabilities.

Management believes it is meeting various milestones well. It expects the production of Class 4 vehicles to start in Q3. Production of Class 5 and 6 delivery vans and trucks will likely start in Q3 2023 and more products could come in 2024.

Recent research highlights: “The global market for electric commercial vehicles is projected to reach over two million units by 2028, with a compound annual growth rate between 2020 and 2028 of around 41 percent.” In other words, Workhorse could, in fact, capture a slice of that growth.

Nonetheless, WKHS stock is down 32% YTD and 63% in the past year. Finally, the 12-month median price forecast for Workhorse is $6. The stock could appeal to potential investors whose portfolios can handle the volatility that comes with a pre-revenue EV stock.

Source: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com

About a month ago I wrote about ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) stock, I said the electric vehicle charging company was waiting for its market to happen.

It’s still waiting. Shares are down almost 30% since then, as the stock market rout that began with tech has become more general.

The problem I have with ChargePoint is the same one I have with myself. It’s early to the party. In my case, it means I write about trends and invest in companies before they’re ready for the mass market. In the case of ChargePoint, they have prepared for a huge electric vehicle market that doesn’t yet exist.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Ticker Company Price CHPT ChargePoint $10.29

The Problem for CHPT Stock

ChargePoint is due to release earnings on May 31, for the quarter ending in April. A loss of 22 cents/share is expected on revenue of $80 million. For the same quarter last year ChargePoint had revenue of $40 million. It had revenue of $240 million for fiscal 2022, which ended in January.

7 Oil Stocks to Buy With Safe Dividends

In the hot market of 2021 such growth was impressive. ChargePoint stock sold for over $35/share last July. Today no one wants it. ChargePoint is selling for about $10.60/share and has a market cap of $3.6 billion. To me, that says you can still lose money on this stock. It’s still selling for about 10 times revenue and is still losing money.

When earnings come out, look at cash flow. ChargePoint lost $174 million in cash for the year ending in January. This left it with $315 million, after coming public in early 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called Switchback Energy.

If ChargePoint has learned to husband cash, and the expected revenue number says it has, think about investing based on the chances the plane will crash. Then buy some more Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN).

It didn’t happen. My beloved Scion was crushed at 10 miles per hour, and I had to buy something this year. I chose a Toyota (NYSE:TM) hybrid. While in the market I walked down my street looking for hybrids and electrics. I found two Teslas (NASDAQ:TSLA), a Nissan (OTCMKTS:NSANY) Leaf, and four Toyota Priuses out of 60 cars.

Since Tesla has its own charging network, I discount those. The fastest ChargePoint charging units, called DC Fast, charge at 480 volts, but the company also has a lot of 240 volt chargers on city streets. These take all night to charge up an electric vehicle and are usually placed as amenities for people to sip charge while they eat or shop.

What ChargePoint needs to succeed is a large market of non-Tesla electrics willing to pay for DC Fast service against competitors like Volkswagen’s (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) Electrify America, EV Go (NASDAQ:EVGO), Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) and the rest.

The Bottom Line on CHPT Stock

ChargePoint is selling charging equipment, not services. This means it can probably survive until the market develops if management is frugal.

As an crunchy granola environmentalist, I would love to suggest that you chase ChargePoint, that you play the EV revolution, and that you accept the latest buy recommendations from brokerages.

But I don’t want you to lose money, as I have, chasing markets that don’t yet exist.

The best strategy right now is to look for tech stocks that offer real products for real markets, with real earnings that save businesses real money. These companies will fight inflation and, while they may not be sexy, they will deliver a return while we wait for electric vehicle production to ramp up.

When will ChargePoint be ready to run? When you read that Buc-ees is putting in electric charging stations.

681,Tesla’s Removal From S&amp;P Index Sparks Debate About ESG Ratings,"(Bloomberg) -- A benchmark ESG stock index has removed Tesla Inc., sparking a debate about which companies do — and don’t — pass muster with socially aware investors.

Stocks Suffer Steepest Rout in Almost Two Years: Markets Wrap Walmart Flashes a Warning Sign to the Entire Consumer Economy Target and Walmart’s Deep Pain Could Be Your Gain Plotkin Shuts Melvin Hedge Fund Left Reeling by Redditor Attack Musk Loses $12 Billion in a Day as He Tweets Politics, Slams ESG

Tesla has grown into a $735 billion company on the back of its breakthrough electric-vehicle engineering. Its own carbon footprint is a small fraction of its peers, and its success in the market has pushed the industry overall away from gas-powered vehicles.

But the other components of ESG — the social and governance risks — give investors pause. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is an unconventional manager, prone to impulsive tweeting, and the company discloses very little information about its workforce or labor conditions.

That split became material Wednesday after it emerged that Tesla was expelled from the ESG version of the S&P 500 Index. Musk responded by saying ESG is “a scam.” It added to an already bad day for the company, whose stock fell 6.8% amid a broad selloff in tech shares.

“This all speaks to the big inconvenient fact about ESG: You can’t keep the baby and throw out the bathwater,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “You have to accept or reject both.”

In a report, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence wrote that Tesla’s ESG status remains among the most debated for any company, with many ESG-labeled funds still holding the stock. In fact, the world’s largest ESG-focused exchange-traded fund has about 1.8% of its assets invested in Tesla, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The fund, BlackRock Inc.’s $21.9 billion iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ticker ESGU), tracks the MSCI USA Extended ESG Focus Index, which still includes Tesla as a member.

Story continues

Balchunas and BI’s Shaheen Contractor wrote Wednesday that eight of the 15 largest US funds that include ESG in their portfolio filters have significant positions in Tesla.

“Though Tesla might fit an environmental focus or impact theme, the company’s social and governance issues make its inclusion in ESG funds debatable and Tesla’s removal from the S&P 500 ESG Index perhaps overdue,” the analysts said in their posting entitled “Is Tesla ESG?”

S&P Dow Jones Indices, which removed Tesla from its S&P 500 ESG Index, said the company’s score on environmental, social and governance standards has remained “fairly stable” over the past year, but it has slipped down the ranks against improving global peers.

The index provider cited concerns related to working conditions and Tesla’s handling of an investigation into deaths and injuries linked to its driver-assistance systems. A lack of low-carbon strategy and codes of business conduct also counted against Musk’s company, it said.

“While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,” Margaret Dorn, senior director and head of ESG indexes for S&P Dow Jones in North America, said in a Tuesday blog post.

Read more: Tesla Loses S&P ESG Index Spot on Crashes, Work Conditions

For months now, Tesla has been critical of ESG. The company said in its annual report that ESG ratings are “fundamentally flawed,” and in an April tweet, Musk said “corporate ESG is the devil incarnate.”

From a market standpoint, Tesla’s removal from the S&P index probably will be minimal as there was only about $11.7 billion that tracked S&P ESG gauges as recently as the end of 2020. By contrast, trillions of dollars track the main S&P 500 gauge.

Investors are split on S&P’s decision. Kristin Hull, founder of Nia Impact Capital, a sustainability fund in Oakland, California, that has been pressing Tesla to address worker issues, said she was relieved that there was “finally accountability.”

Zach Stein, chief investment officer of Carbon Collective, a climate-change focused online investment adviser based in Berkeley, California, said the opposite. The biggest issue in ESG is climate change, so kicking out the leading maker of electric vehicles makes no sense, especially since companies like Exxon Mobil Corp. remain in the S&P index, he said.

682,Elon Musk has lost $49 billion since first offering to buy Twitter for $44 billion,"While Elon Musk was busy on Wednesday, announcing changes to his political leaning and thrashing “wactivists” on Twitter, the share price of Tesla sank to its lowest level of the year, wiping $12.3 billion from his net worth.

After Wednesday's 6% drop, Tesla shares are now down 28% since Musk launched his bid to buy Twitter on Apr. 14. This means that the vocal Musk's net worth has sunk by $49 billion since he first made his $44 billion offer.

The fall in Tesla stock came alongside a wider market tumble, which saw the S&P 500 drop 4% over the course of the day. But the electric vehicle maker also faced its own unique headwind Wednesday, as it was excluded from the S&P sustainability ESG index due in part to claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla’s California factory.

Musk took to Twitter saying ""ESG is a scam,"" adding that S&P had ""lost their credibility"" and he would be switching his political support from Democrat to Republican.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526997132858822658

Still the richest man

Musk still remains the world’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His current fortune is estimated to be $210 billion—equivalent to 1% of the GDP of the U.S. and 3 million times greater than the median U.S. household income.

But Elon Musk’s net worth has fallen a lot from the $340 billion peak he reached in November 2021. Since the start of the year, Musk has seen his wealth trimmed by 22.4%, or $60.4 billion, trailing behind only Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who’s down $81 billion year-to-date, and Jeff Bezos, who has lost $62 billion this year.

Musk’s wealth began to fall precipitously after he first bought a 10% stake in Twitter on Apr. 4. By the time he made a formal offer to buy Twitter on Apr. 14, Tesla shares had fallen by 14%. On the day Twitter accepted Musk's offer of a buyout, shares in Tesla slid another 12%, as market watchers feared Musk wouldn’t have enough cash sitting around to fund the Twitter purchase and would sell Tesla shares to fund the project (he did sell $8.5 billion worth).

Story continues

The recent slide in Tesla's share price has erased a substantial part of the gains the company made during the pandemic, which saw its market cap rise from $117 billion in January 2020 to $1 trillion in October 2021. Tesla’s market capitalization currently sits at $735 billion.

And as Elon Musk's fortune slides along with Tesla's shares, the company he is trying to acquire has also sunk in valuation. Twitter stock is trading 36% below Musk’s $54.20 offer price, at $36.85 a share.

Hump day tumble

In his latest Twitter outburst, Elon Musk raged about Tesla's expulsion from the S&P ESG index while ExxonMobil, one of the biggest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions in the world, was kept in.

“ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors,” Musk said. He then posted a meme saying the sustainability criteria put in place by S&P have to do with ""how compliant your business is with the leftist agenda”

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526958110023245829

Elon Musk then announced he would be voting Republican.

Musk has become somewhat of a conservative hero since he announced his plan to buy Twitter and make it into a free-speech platform like a “digital town square.”

Many conservatives have said his buyout would eliminate the biases that social media giants have against them, and right-wing Twitter accounts saw large increases in follower counts on the day the buyout was announced.

Musk has previously criticized President Joe Biden’s administration, saying that it “doesn’t get a lot done,” and has also attacked Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, all of whom have advocated higher taxes on billionaires. He has also said that it was “flat out stupid” for the platform to ban Trump after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol raid.

693,Twitter Rises on Bloomberg Report That Musk Acquisition Moving Forward as Planned,"By Sam Boughedda

Investing.com -- Shares of Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) jumped over 2.5% in late Thursday trading following a Bloomberg report that executives told employees the $44 billion deal to sell the social media giant to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is ""moving forward as planned.""

Citing sources who attended the meeting, Bloomberg said Twitter executives stated in an all-hands meeting Thursday that there will not be a renegotiation on the agreed-upon $54.20 per share price.

Twitter's top lawyer Vijaya Gadde was reported to have told employees the deal is not on hold.

Musk tweeted earlier this week to say the deal was on hold due to issues regarding the number of bots and spam accounts on the social media platform.

The meeting was said to have involved other top Twitter executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, and was intended for leadership to discuss the deal and answer questions.

694,Billionaire Tesla bull urges Musk to announce historic $15bn stock buyback as carmaker’s share price sinks,"With Tesla trading at lows not seen since August, the carmaker’s third-largest investor urged the company to prop up the market by announcing “immediately” plans for a historic stock buyback.

Singapore-based billionaire Leo KoGuan’s call for management to deploy cash lying around on its balance sheet is the clearest sign yet that the company’s owners are getting restless.

Never before has Tesla paid a cash dividend or bought back its shares, as it reinvested everything back into its business to finance further growth.

Returning cash to investors is typically a move much more mature companies would consider if they found few entrepreneurial opportunities where the return warranted the risk.

https://twitter.com/KoguanLeo/status/1527287983228874757?s=20u0026t=Qquo8v6vuvmTAr4YN4RiiA

As recently as December 2020, Tesla was even raising fresh equity from investors at around $633, meaning many of those investors that once saw their investment double by last November are barely above water now.

“We Tesla bulls need more support,” KoGuan tweeted, pointing to the company’s prodigious cash reserves.

""Tesla can invest in (Full Self-Driving), bot and factories while buying back its undervalued stocks. Shock and wake up few braindead analysts to their senses.""

KoGuan suggested an amount of $5 billion this year and double that amount for 2023 — a total of $15bn, financed strictly by excess cash it cannot funnel back into growing the business that otherwise would earn pennies to the dollar in interest.

That way shareholders could be rewarded without endangering the strength of its balance sheet.

https://twitter.com/KoguanLeo/status/1527146037755777024?s=20u0026t=hOaFXT8DVVHefIdJ_KZp3w

Tesla can afford it, too. The company generated a free cash flow of $5 billion in 2021, more than half of which came in the fourth quarter alone.

In the first three months of this year, it dipped sequentially to $2.2 billion, but this still amounted to a sizeable year-on-year gain.

Story continues

This left cash and cash equivalents, such as money market funds, at $18 billion as of the end of March — more than enough to fund short-term needs, according to KoGuan.

Pennies to the dollar

Gary Black, another Tesla bull frustrated with the development in the price, chimed in to argue the Singaporean billionaire was “100% correct” in his estimation.

“Stock buybacks of $5 billion in 2022 and $10 billion in 2023 are far superior to letting cash build on the balance sheet at 2-3% return on investment,” he posted.

https://twitter.com/MartinViecha/status/1441084980843532292?s=20u0026t=u0LIVVY9TENLQ7t-7iZssQ

Shares in Tesla traded flat at $710 each in early trading on Thursday, the lowest level since late August, amid a broader lack of appetite for growth stocks and CEO Elon Musk's risky acquisition plans for Twitter that currently overshadow sentiment.

KoGuan burst onto the Tesla scene last September when he stated he was the third largest shareholder, a claim later verified by Tesla’s head of investor relations, Martin Viecha.

According to a report in Bloomberg published the following month, bank records provided by KoGuan confirmed he owned 6.31 million shares as of late September along with options for a further 1.82 million at strike price well below present levels.

That makes him the third largest shareholder after Musk and Larry Ellison, founder of business software giant Oracle.

695,"Tesla Stock: China Headwinds Merit a Price Target Cut, Says Top Analyst","China has long been considered an essential component of Tesla’s (TSLA) ongoing success. The country has not only been committed to advancing electric vehicles, but is also home to its flagship Gigafactory, located in Shanghai.

Wedbush’s Daniel Ives has repeatedly stressed the region’s importance to Tesla and thinks the current China headwinds are “hard to ignore.”

“The success of the China story on both the supply and demand side are the linchpins to our long-term bull thesis in Tesla,” the 5-star analyst explained. “That said, the reality is the current Shanghai lockdowns have been an epic disaster so far in the June quarter.”

The zero Covid policy saw the Shanghai factory shutdown during April which obviously hit production hard and despite a reopening - which Ives notes as being “very choppy,” – the supply chain is now facing a host of issues all the way through to the logistics of shipping Model 3's/Y's.

The effect of the lockdown has been a “deterrent for delivery growth” with Ives now anticipating Q2 will show weak China sales with some “spillover” into Q3. Although Ives expects the company to push ahead in 2H, the prospect of another outbreak and lockdown looms large and could provide yet more “bumps in the road.”

As such, to reflect “softness” in China and the ongoing supply woes, Ives has lowered estimates for Q2. Ives now expects total deliveries of 277,000, a drop from the prior forecast of 297,000 units. The revenue estimate is also reduced - from $16.9 billion to $15.9 billion, while the EPS forecast is also to $2.10 from the prior $2.80.

China is not the only issue for Tesla right now. Musk’s bid to buy Twitter has been a constant sideshow recently which the analyst believes is causing investors to turn away. Although the “Tesla fundamental story” is not directly impacted from the ongoing Twitter shenanigans, given we are currently in the midst of the “worst supply chain crisis seen in modern history,” Ives thinks Musk should be focused on more on Tesla, and less on other distractions.

Story continues

While Ives reiterated an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on Tesla shares, the analyst slashed the price target to $1,000 (from $1,400). (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)

Most on the Street also back Tesla but not all are on board. The stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on a mix of 14 Buys, 10 Holds and 5 Sells. According to the $940.90 average target, the shares will climb 29% higher in the year ahead. (See Tesla stock forecast on TipRanks)

696,Stock Market Today: Dow on Cusp of 8 Weekly Losses as Tech Selloff Continues,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The Dow fell Thursday, leaving the broader market on the precipice of an eighth-straight weekly loss as early-day attempts to claw recent losses proved short-lived amid an ongoing melt down in tech.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.75%, or 236 points, the Nasdaq fell 0.3% and the S&P 500 fell 0.6% to take losses to about 18% since its recent peak, just shy of a 20% decline into bear-market territory.

Technology stocks, which were briefly in the green, came under fire as expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes continued to weigh on investor sentiment.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), led the decline in big tech, down more than 2%, even as some on Wall Street reassessed their outlook on iPhone demand.

Bank of America raised its estimates on iPhone sales to 237 million units from 231 million for Apple's 2023 fiscal year, after conceding that prior iPhone estimates may have been “too conservative.”

Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) was also a big drag on the market, plunging about 14% after the network company reported quarterly results and guidance that fell short of Wall Street estimates owing to the impact of China lockdowns.

“Although the lockdown is expected to be lifted on June 1, it remains uncertain if improvements can be seen in the short term considering ports and airports are expected to be congested as nearly all manufacturers will compete for the capacity to get their products shipped,” Credit Suisse said in a note.

Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) reversed about 9% after suspending most vehicle assembly and shipment for two weeks after a supplier was caught up in a regulatory compliance matter.

Consumer staples, a defensive corner of the market, also pushed the broader market lower, with the latter pressured by losses in Clorox (NYSE:CLX), Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) and Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP).

Consumer discretionary stocks cut gains to end the day just above the flatline as Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) gave up some fo their gains.

Story continues

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ended the flat after its intraday rally cooled after Wedbush slashed its price on the stock, forecasting a China-led dip in deliveries for the second quarter.

Wedbush cut its price target on Tesla to $1,000 from $1,400, pointing to the Shanghai lockdowns, which have been an “epic disaster” and are expected to modestly impact delivery in the second quarter, the research firm said.

The economy front did little to soften fears of slowing economic growth ahead after jobless claims increased by more than expected, while the Philly Fed index showed a sharp downturn in manufacturing activity.

In other news, Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) fell nearly 12% after the apparel retailer unexpectedly announced that chief executive Patrik Frisk would be stepping down on June 1.

697,One of Tesla's biggest bulls is suddenly less bullish,"Long-time Tesla bull Dan Ives sees a little less horsepower behind the EV maker's stock.

The Wedbush Securities managing director slashed his price target on Tesla to $1,000 from $1,400 in a new note out on Thursday while maintaining an outperform rating.

""The success of the China story on both the supply and demand side are the linchpins to our long term bull thesis in Tesla,"" Ives wrote. ""That said, the reality is the current Shanghai lockdowns have been an epic disaster so far in the June quarter and we expect Tesla to see modest delivery softness this quarter with a slower growth trajectory in the key China region into the second half.""

Tesla stock, the second most active ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform, was up slightly in midday trading on Thursday.

Ives's more muted stance on Tesla is logical given the importance of the China market to the company and recent sales trends from the region.

Tesla only sold 1,512 cars in China in April, a 98% plunge from March, according to fresh data from the China Passenger Car Association. The declines reflect the heavy impact from the country's zero-tolerance COVID-19 lockdown, which has hurt everything from making cars at Tesla to getting enough chips to deliver products at Cisco.

The data also showed Tesla's production in China dropped 81% to 10,757 in April. Tesla didn't export any autos from Shanghai in the month. In March, it exported 60.

""We expect weak China sales this quarter with some spillover into 3Q,"" Ives wrote. ""While Tesla should be able to ramp aggressively into the second half within the China region on the production front, with the zero Covid policy looming there will likely be some bumps in the road over the coming months as well."" Tesla China-made Model 3 vehicles are seen during a delivery event at its factory in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song

The veteran analyst also flagged CEO Elon Musk's ongoing battle to buy Twitter as a distraction that could continue weighing on the stock. Tesla shares have shed 33% since Musk revealed his stake in the social media platform back in early April.

Story continues

""While the Twitter situation in theory does not impact the Tesla fundamental story,"" Ives noted, ""the distraction risks for Musk (perception is reality) are hard to ignore at a time that the Tesla ecosystem have never needed Musk more with the worst supply chain crisis seen in modern history.""

699,Tesla investor calls for share buyback after Musk's Twitter deal hurts stocks,"By Hyunjoo Jin

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Leo KoGuan, a major individual investor in Tesla, on Thursday called on the electric carmaker to buy back shares, after Tesla stocks took a hit from CEO Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter.

The comments came as high-profile Tesla bull Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, on Thursday cut the target share price of Tesla due to China production disruption, and warned of ""distraction risks"" from Musk's Twitter deal.

Tesla shares lost one third of their value since Musk disclosed his stake in Twitter in early April and sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla stocks in a move seen to help finance his $44-billion Twitter deal.

Further hurting stocks is China lockdown measures that dampened Tesla's production and an exclusion of Tesla from a widely-followed S&P sustainability index.

""Tesla must announce immediately and buy back $5 billion of Tesla shares from its free cash flow this year and $10 billion from its free cash flow next year, without effecting its existing $18 billion cash reserves with ZERO debt,"" KoGuan said in a Twitter message to Tesla's head of investor relations, Martin Viecha.

Viecha was not immediately available for comment.

Last year, KoGuan claimed in a tweet that he was the third largest individual shareholder of Tesla who owns more Tesla shares than that of ARK Invest and Baron Capital. Viecha at that time said he ""confirmed"" the claims.

KoGuan previously said he was investing billions in Tesla because he believes in Musk's ""great vision I share."" He said in March that he was buying more Tesla shares, not selling during the stocks' dip.

Tesla bull Gary Black, portfolio manager at The Future Fund, told Reuters, “If he (Musk) could get out (of the Twitter deal) Tesla’s stock would go up 10%.""

The strategy, widely seen as favoring industries ostensibly interested in sustainability (of the environmental, social and governance sort), started about two decades ago as a way to protect investors from risks tied to things like global warming, labor violations and discrimination. Since then, it’s morphed into a $35 trillion industry that’s allowed millions of investors to feel as though they’re “doing good.” And now people are confused about what ESG is really supposed to achieve.

“The market continues to conflate ESG with sustainability, and you’re certainly seeing that play out here,” said Rob Du Boff, senior ESG analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Our ETF team likes to note Tesla is the ultimate Rorschach test for ESG investors.”

While many would agree few automakers have done more than Elon Musk’s company in the global shift away from fossil fuels, Tesla’s management and workplace issues have been at times problematic. So much so that S&P Dow Jones Indices, while acknowledging Tesla’s environmental prowess, nevertheless decided to remove the electric vehicle maker from the S&P 500 ESG Index over safety and labor issues.

“How can a company whose self-declared mission is to ‘accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy’ not make the cut in an ESG index?” wrote Margaret Dorn, senior director and head of ESG indexes for S&P Dow Jones in North America, in a blog post. Answering her own question, she said “there are many reasons,” including that Tesla “has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens.”

Story continues

Dorn focused on social and governance factors at the company, which had a negative impact on its overall ESG score. She singled out two events centered around allegations of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, as well as its handling of a U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation after multiple deaths and injuries were linked to its “autopilot” function.

Academics like Todd Cort of Yale University agree with Dorn. The S&P methodology focuses on corporate performance, and Tesla’s “management systems and controls are still pretty undeveloped” relative to industry leaders, he said.

But investors including Cathie Wood of ARK Investment Management have strenuously disagreed. In a post on Twitter, she called S&P’s decision “ridiculous.” It’s “not worthy of any other response.”

Paul Watchman, an industry consultant who wrote a seminal report in the mid-2000s that helped spur ESG investing, said Tesla should be part of ESG indexes. “Not all breaches of ESG are equal, and this assessment shows just how warped the S&P assessment is,” he said.

Tesla does have multiple problems related to corporate governance and health and safety, but Watchman said they should be viewed in context. “However relevant these failures and shortcomings may be, they aren’t nearly as bad other companies.” Fossil fuel giants being one example, he said.

MSCI Inc., the leading provider of ESG ratings, still includes Tesla (as well as Exxon Mobil Corp.) in its more widely tracked ESG-focused indexes, adding to the confusion about what ESG actually is. (The methodologies MSCI and S&P use for their ESG indexes are very similar.)

MSCI said its ESG-focused indexes are designed to “maximize their exposure to positive ESG factors” while “exhibiting risk and return characteristics” similar to the overall market. Companies with links to the tobacco, “controversial” weapons, civilian firearms, oil sands and thermal coal are excluded from the indexes.

S&P Dow Jones Indices said its S&P 500 ESG Index is “a broad-based, market-cap-weighted index that’s designed to measure the performance of securities meeting sustainability criteria, while maintaining similar overall industry weights as the S&P 500.” The index also excludes companies engaged in the thermal coal, tobacco and controversial weapons industries.

Still, widespread confusion over the metrics and measurements that go into ESG has become more controversial over time. But from a market standpoint, ESG indexes matter because investors have poured $410 billion into passively run ESG-labeled funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

Tesla has made the world a greener place with their innovative electric vehicles, and investors have been rewarded as a result, BI’s Du Boff said. Shareholders also have been stung by Musk’s tussles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and his recent takeover approach to Twitter Inc., he said.

“Turns out investors should have been paying closer attention to signs of poor corporate governance,” Du Boff said.

And that brings the conversation back to trying to define ESG. Hours after it emerged that S&P Dow Jones had expelled Tesla, Shaheen Contractor and Eric Balchunas from BI published a note with this headline: “Is Tesla ESG? Many Funds Think So Even as S&P ESG Index Drops It.”

Contractor and Balchunas said their analysis ranks Tesla 46th in the S&P 500 for inclusion in ESG-focused funds. “The automaker’s ESG status remains among the most debated for any stock,” they wrote.

Wall Street is getting smoked this week. But pot producer Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB) is proving that in a market made up of stocks, there’s always a bull market somewhere. Moreover, it’s one that could still be worth buying into with ACB stock.

The major averages are seeing a rally attempt off year-to-date corrective lows being firmly challenged. For its part the S&P 500 is off 2.65% for the period after having come within 1% of last week’s bottoming hammer candlestick low. But cannabis stock ACB is up nearly 8.50% into Thursday’s session.

So, what gives? Broader worries of retail-driven inflation and hawkish Fed speak appears to have been trumped in ACB stock by news of Aurora receiving certification for a medical grade weed production facility in Germany and assisting the company with a German medical cannabis contract awarded in 2019.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Will the bullishly relaxed behavior continue? Let’s dig into other pros and cons of owning ACB stock and strategies which can allow investors to be more calculated risk-takers.

ACB Aurora Cannabis $3.0350

Not So “Amazing, Eh” Q3 for Canada’s Aurora Cannabis

A past acquisition and grow strategy to be the pot market’s largest producer and weaker consumers craving value cannabis products over higher-margin pot derivatives negatively impacted ACB shareholders as the Edmonton outfit’s Q3 results revealed this past week.

7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Investors Catch On

ACB announced an adjusted loss of CA$.85 per share and well above street estimates of a loss of 21 cents. Moreover, its diluted loss amounted to red ink of around CA$1.0 billion on the back of massive goodwill charges tied to a misplaced growth strategy or as Aurora officials laid out, write-offs on property, plants and equipment needed to create a “leaner, more agile organization.”

Story continues

At the same time, revenues of CA$55.16 million fell around 9% year-over-year and undercut analyst views of CA$66.92 million. Amid increased retail competition in Canada and driving the weak result, adult-use cannabis sales shrank 53% for the third quarter compared to the prior year’s third quarter.

Lastly, Aurora burned through reserves with negative free cash flow of about CA$45 million. It countered the outflow by raising CA$139 million during the March quarter and further reducing shareholder value with dilution that’s soared from just over one million shares to nearly 225 million since 2014.

“Das Ist Gudt”, i.e. The Pros For ACB Stock Aurora Cannabis (ACB) lifetime double bottom confirmed by weekly hammer and stochastics

Source: Charts by TradingView

The good news? In fact, there was some of that too in ACB stock’s earnings announcement. Aurora did announce its successfully reducing costs which should help turn the company profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis by next year.

Also, adjusted gross margins during the third quarter grew to 54% versus last year’s third quarter figure of 44%. And while Aurora’s Canadian retail business took a hit, ACB’s international medical business was up 55% year-over-year driven by growth in key markets such as European power Germany and a handful of other countries.

Then there’s the more positive aspect of Aurora’s capital raising. At the end of the quarter the company noted it has around $525 million in cash on hand to focus on higher margin, premium cannabis products, overseas expansion and help support organic growth and opportunistic M&A activity.

The long-term price chart in ACB stock is also revealing conditions which bullish investors can salivate over.

Shares have confirmed a lifetime double bottom pattern roughly seven years in-the-making after ACB stock traded above last week’s hammer candlestick. Coupled with a supportive-looking stochastics setup, bearish street sentiment and decent short interest, in plain English, the technical situation “is good” for contrarian-minded buyers.

Trading Long Exposure in ACB Stock

Today and if it wasn’t altogether clear, ACB stock has its share of pros and cons. And if investors do see the cannabis producer as a buy, it doesn’t deserve to be a core holding. In no shape or form is owning Aurora similar to buying ground floor opportunities in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or other great growth stories of the past couple decades. Sorry.

That all said, ACB stock buyers have an entry point where the reward looks to outweigh the risk by a minimum of around 3-to-1. That’s based on purchasing shares near $3.05, booking profits near Fibonacci zone resistance centered around $5.00, if ACB is able to rally, and likewise, taking a loss if the stock falters and takes out the hammer low.

Alternatively, investors willing to accept that sort of risk may want to consider the pricing on an intermediate or longer-term and slightly out-of-the-money $4.00 or even $5.00 call. With this type of strategy it’s possible to increase upside exposure and further limit downside losses with a larger allocation of bullish contracts at a reduced dollar cost to owning ACB shares.

703,Twitter executives say deal with Elon Musk is not ‘on hold’,"Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reviews how Twitter executives are going through with the acquisition deal with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, in addition to Musk's concerns on the platform's bot accounts.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Let's get to the latest on the Elon Musk and Twitter saga because a new day and we know that there are certainly are new developments. Twitter executives now reportedly saying that the price of the deal is not up for discussion. Tech editor Dan Howley is following this story for us. And Dan, we know there's been some back and forth. It looks like Elon Musk is trying to get a better deal. But Twitter might not be coming to the table on this one.

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, it doesn't sound like they're coming to the table at all or have no appetite for this at all. According to reports, Twitter's top lawyer essentially said there's no such thing as putting a deal on hold. And that's in response to, obviously, Elon Musk saying that the deal was on hold because he didn't like what he saw when it came to bot numbers. Now, this really goes back to when he originally wanted to purchase Twitter.

Obviously, $54.20 per share, excuse me, $44 billion. But right now, I mean, Twitter is trading well lower than that, $73.29. So, you know, obviously, he's going to be paying a little bit of a premium there if it sticks at that. And so a lot of people are now thinking, is he purposely trying to distance himself from this, playing up this bot discussion, just so he has a way to get out? Now--

DAVE BRIGGS: Yes.

DAN HOWLEY: I mean, well, that's the thing, right? He posted earlier today basically a meme of Twitter, showing that it runs only bots, and that's it's only run bots and that the Twitter board has known this the whole time. I mean, look, it really comes down to whether or not they want to-- Twitter wants to go ahead and try to sue if Musk tries to get out of this. They could do that. That could be a long, long process. Or they could both break it off. If Elon breaks it off, he's going to pay a billion.

Story continues

If Twitter breaks it off, they're going to pay a billion. So either way, someone's going to lose money here. You got to wonder how Twitter employees feel at this point because their lives are basically in limbo until they find out who's going to be their next boss, and then what that means for the company going forward.

DAVE BRIGGS: There's more than $10 billion already trimmed off their market cap. It was at 50 bucks a share when Elon started making this move. And to your point, it's at 37 now. Let's get back to the heart of the matter, which is, at least, Elon says is about the bot. So he clearly is just a man with cold feet. Wouldn't this just be done in an hour in a conversation? Parag Agrawal is a very smart man. Elon said yesterday, he thinks it's 20%. He's urging the SEC to investigate. Couldn't this have been done on a phone call? And how do we not have a definitive answer?

DAN HOWLEY: Well, according to Twitter, that 5%, or less than 5%, of users is--

DAVE BRIGGS: Exactly.

DAN HOWLEY: That's accurate, according to what they've done. They say they use automated processes to check, as well as humans to check. So, you know, that's what Parag Agrawal was saying over the weekend when he was tweeting. And Elon Musk-- or rather, Monday, when he was tweeting, and then Elon Musk firing back, saying that that's not true. He wanted to look at the information. Agrawal basically said, look, we can't put that information out publicly. That's our private stuff. And you are not the owner of the company yet, at least.

So, you know, it really does come down to what that number is. And some researchers have said it can be as high as 20%. 13.7% was a number from an Israeli company. That was their guess. Elon has said, oh, God knows it could be 90%. So, obviously, you know, exaggerating there. But I don't know if they'll get an actual number anytime soon, outside of him purchasing the company. And it seems that Twitter is going to hold his feet to the fire and say, you wanted this fight. And now you got it, so we're going to stick you to it.

DAVE BRIGGS: Loudest quiet period in history.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. And Dan, just real quick, before we let you go, do you think that with all this back and forth and what Elon Musk has put forward about the changes, some of the changes that he wants to see to Twitter, do you think that whether or not he buys it, we, in fact, will see some change at Twitter, just in terms of their business model and how they're doing things?

DAN HOWLEY: I mean, I think with Agrawal, he was going to try to monetize the company better anyway, right? That was kind of why he was there, to better monetize Twitter, which is something that the company has been criticized for ad nauseum for years and years and years. I think that they'll continue to try to do something along those lines. Don't forget they introduced a subscription service.

So, you know, I think that they're going to try to improve it regardless. Musk really-- I mean, he said he doesn't care if it makes money. So he would eliminate advertising. I mean, the company is an advertising company. Look, I use Twitter for work. That's it. I am not paying anything for Twitter. I'll take the ads. But if you start asking me to pay for it, then I'm just going to delete it. I don't care, so.

SEANA SMITH: I'm with you. Would you pay for it?

DAVE BRIGGS: 2 bucks a month, that's my limit.

SEANA SMITH: You would pay 2 bucks?

DAVE BRIGGS: 2 bucks a month.

DAN HOWLEY: No way.

DAVE BRIGGS: I got friends who would pay 30 bucks a month for Twitter. They're watching right now, yeah.

SEANA SMITH: Wow.

DAN HOWLEY: You should pay me--

SEANA SMITH: Money bags.

The two will discuss a potential partnership on rural connectivity and deforestation monitoring, according to O Globo.

The meeting follows a meeting of the SpaceX and Tesla chief executive with Brazilian Communications Minister Fabio Faria in November in Austin, Texas. The two spoke about using SpaceX technology to bring internet to rural schools and cut back on illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.

According to the O Globo report, the Friday meeting will happen in an upscale hotel near the city of Sorocaba in Sao Paulo state and will be attended by several business executives, including Telecom Italia Chief Executive Pietro Labriola and the chairman of Brazilian lender Banco BTG Pactual, Andre Esteves.

Musk will meet Brazil's far-right president just days after he said on Twitter he could no longer support Democrats ""and will vote Republican.""

Bolsonaro, who celebrated Twitter's announcement of its acceptance of Musk's initial bid for the company, has been trying for years to lure Tesla to Brazil.

In 2020, his son, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, said he had met with the former charge d'affaires at the U.S. embassy in Brasilia, William Popp, to discuss a plan to attract the automaker to build a factory in the country. Soon after, Bolsonaro stated a desire to visit a Tesla plant on a visit to the U.S.

707,S&amp;P Dumps Tesla From Its ESG Index. One Critic Calls the Move ‘A True Indictment’ of ESG Ratings.,Criticism of ESG ratings has been on the rise this year for multiple reasons. S&P's latest move is adding to the outcry.,2022-05-20T06:30:00+00:00
708,Analysis-Musk's ESG attack spotlights $35 trillion industry confusion,"By Simon Jessop and Ross Kerber

LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Elon Musk's rejection of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores as a ""scam"" highlights how Wall Street's hottest investment trend that encompasses some $35 trillion in assets means different things to different people.

The chief executive of Tesla Inc lashed out on Wednesday against S&P Global Inc after the electric car maker was dropped from its flagship ESG index while it added some companies whose activities are harmful to the environment, such as oil and gas producers.

Musk took to Twitter to express his frustration with the move ""despite Tesla doing more for the environment than any company ever!"" He added that ESG ""has been weaponized by phoney social justice warriors.""

S&P Dow Jones Indices senior director Margaret Dorn told Reuters that Tesla had been excluded from the index because its score declined slightly just as the scores of other automakers had improved. Tesla was not excluded because S&P executives decided to kick the company out of the index over a particular issue, she added.

While Tesla's cars contribute to lower carbon emissions, its ESG score had ""fallen behind"" in other aspects, such as poor working conditions at its U.S. Fremont factory, claims of racial discrimination and its handling of a U.S. government probe into multiple deaths and injuries linked to its autopilot technology.

Sustainable investing - taking into account ESG factors in portfolio selection - has exploded in recent years, reaching $35.3 trillion by the start of 2020, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance.

Half a dozen investment managers interviewed by Reuters said Musk's spat with S&P illustrates how confusion still reigns over how many investors and executives view the industry.

Some, like Musk, believe the ratings should reward companies that do the most for the planet and society. Others, including firms like S&P that produce the scores, say they are meant to show how much risk a company's stock faces from ESG factors.

Story continues

This explains why some companies that are major contributors to climate change, such as Exxon Corp, are allowed to stay in an ESG index if they can show they are taking actions to reduce that risk.

""Ultimately ESG is a way of identifying and trying to quantify risk. So it's basically risk mitigation,"" said Chi Chan, portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. ""Effectively Musk is conflating ESG with sustainability.""

Mark Tinker, chief investment officer at Toscafund Hong Kong, said Musk ""rightly pointed out"" that societal and corporate governance considerations are being used ""for political driven cancelling"" and that a company's contribution to the environment can also ""mean what you want it to.""

""The whole thing is very subjective,"" Tinker said.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of the company or Musk.

S&P published the change in its ESG index on April 22. But it was not until May 18, a day after Horn wrote a blog post that explained why Tesla was excluded from the index, that Twitter users started disseminating it, catching Musk's attention.

Only a tiny fraction of the ESG's industry's assets under management - $11.7 billion as of the end of 2020 - are tied to S&P Indexes. S&P's influential ESG index rival MSCI Inc has so far kept Tesla in its bluechip ESG index.

It was not immediately clear if the exclusion from the S&P ESG index had any impact on Tesla's shares this week. The stock had already been sliding almost every day since early April, losing close to 40% of its value, amid concerns that China's COVID-19-related lockdowns will disrupt Tesla's car production and a potential economic slowdown and raging inflation will dampen demand for its vehicles.

Uncertainty over whether Musk will complete his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter Inc has also weighed on Tesla's stock.

SCORE BREAKDOWN

S&P declined to provide a breakdown of its ESG score of Tesla, which is compiled based on scores of the company's various operations and practices.

MSCI also declined to provide a breakdown, but a May 3 copy of its Tesla rating sent to investors and reviewed by Reuters shows how its perceived poor performance on social issues took some of the shine out of the company's strong green credentials.

Tesla scored 9.1 out of 10 on environmental grounds, against an industry average of 6.5. This made up 30% of its total ESG score. On social issues, however, it ranked 1.4 compared with an average of 3.5, while on governance it scored 5.1 against an average of 3.2.

Andrew Poreda, senior vice president for Sage Advisory Services, an Austin-based investment firm, said as a Tesla investor he understood why the company's ESG scores were lower than they might have been based solely on the company's contribution in the fight against climate change.

""You can't live in a vacuum of just environmental or just social issues, they are all intertwined,"" Poreda said.

Elon Musk’s company had commanded the pole position by market value in the ARK Innovation ETF, an exchange-traded fund known as ARKK, on most days since at least 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That changed on Thursday, when electronics product maker Roku Inc., a firm with $13.2 billion of market value, pipped it to take the top spot.

ARKK held Tesla shares worth about $703 million as of Thursday’s close, versus a position of $717 million in Roku, according to ARK Investment Management LLC.’s data compiled by Bloomberg.

Like ARKK’s 55% drop this year, Tesla’s loss of its star status in the ETF is a reminder of the pressure on growth stocks from rising interest rates and a darkening global economic outlook. It also came after a 33% plunge in the electric car maker’s shares this year, following their rise to a record in 2021.

ARK Investment and its flagship fund have been selling Tesla shares for at least four quarters in a row, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. The firm owned nearly 1.59 million Tesla shares as of the end of March, down from nearly 5.79 million shares a year earlier.

ARK’s daily trading updates show only active decisions by the management team and don’t include creation or redemption activity caused by investor flows. Wood’s oft-repeated mantra is that ARK invests with at least a five-year time horizon, and that volatility in their equity picks is expected.

710,Wall Street Opens Higher Despite Mixed Retail Earnings; Dow Up 240 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, with short-covering the order of the day after volatile week dominated by recession fears.

By 9:44 AM ET (1344 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 243 points, or 0.8%, at 31,496 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.0%.

However, the main indices are still on course for their lowest weekly close in a year and a half, after a sequence of poor earnings reports from the retail sector pointed to growth slowing under the weight of inflation.

Federal Reserve officials have also squashed any incipient hopes that they might ride to the market's rescue by not raising rates as far and as fast as currently expected. Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Minnesota's Neel Kashkari - who are at the opposing ends of the hawk-dove policy spectrum, both played down suggestions that the stock market's woes will make it relax its policy.

J.P. Morgan analysts cut their growth forecasts for U.S. growth for both this year and 2023 on Thursday, adjusting to the likelihood of the Fed raising rates above the 'neutral rate' in order to choke off excess demand.

Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) added to the general malaise in retail, falling 21% to a four-year low after publishing its quarterly numbers on Thursday evening. Ross said it faces an ""increasingly uncertain macro-economic and geopolitical environment"" and now expects comparable sales to fall this year, having earlier expected modest growth.

Deere&Co. (NYSE:DE) stock also fell over 10% despite the maker of farming equipment raising its profit outlook for the year by around 5%. Analysts said the guidance may prove to be too aggressive. The stock has been a favorite defensive play recently, with high agricultural commodity prices seen likely to underpin demand for its machinery for the foreseeable future.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, meanwhile, fell 4.2% to its lowest since August after CEO Elon Musk told an event that he expects to be producing fully-autonomous cars ""around a year from now."" Musk has been issuing similar guidance for most of the last eight years. The stock has suffered from selling by passive funds this week after it was dropped by S&P Global from a benchmark ESG-themed index due to repeated instances of racial discrimination in its factories.

Story continues

Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) stock fared better, opening 7.9% higher after beating expectations for earnings by around 6% in the last quarter.

Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) was another stock heading higher, rising 12.4% after beating expectations for sales and profit in the last quarter and raising its guidance for the full year. The cybersecurity specialist was arguably due a bounce after losing nearly one-third of its value in the last month, a victim of the sharp rerating of long-duration growth stocks.

Conservatives have identified the popular investing strategy, which accounts for environmental, social and governance risks, as part of a broader narrative about left-wing overreach and “ wokeness” run amok. Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks calls it “corporate cancel culture.” Behind the rhetoric lie policies designed to sap the momentum of one of Wall Street’s most successful initiatives in recent years, now worth $35 trillion globally. If it works, it will firmly ensconce ESG in the culture wars, galvanize voters and weaken the resolve of big asset managers to act on climate change and other big, societal issues.

West Virginians are already all too familiar with ESG, according to state treasurer Riley Moore. He’s preparing a list of banks that, he says, will lose the state’s business unless they declare they aren’t boycotting the coal industry and other fossil fuels. “Certainly ‘woke capitalism’ is something they are very familiar with,” he said. “We’re facing threats from that in my state, right now.”

The attacks on ESG escalated last week when former Vice President Mike Pence made the strategy a key theme in an energy-policy speech in Houston. A potential candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, Pence said large investment firms are pushing a “radical ESG agenda” and took aim at BlackRock Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink is a champion of sustainable investing, and others who have pressed for progress on climate change.

Story continues

Pence added to the growing public attacks on ESG. On Wednesday, Tesla Inc. founder and libertarian influencer Elon Musk told his 94 million Twitter followers that “ ESG is a scam,” building on a March tweet in which he labeled the practice “the Devil incarnate.” Republican megadonor Peter Thiel called ESG a “hate factory for naming enemies” in a speech at a Bitcoin conference in April, and the Twitter bio of right-wing pundit Glenn Beck now reads, “Against ESG before it was cool.”

With gas prices rising and energy a key factor in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s becoming easier for Republicans to tie ESG to pocketbook issues of their constituents. Just as Critical Race Theory grew from a catchall for parents unhappy or worried about what their children were learning in public schools to successful efforts to seize control of local school boards, ESG opponents see an opportunity to aim voters’ fears of inflation at the finance industry’s efforts to combat global warming and other social ills.

It’s also a new front in a longstanding battle against further restrictions on fossil-fuel industries, which give generously to Republican party candidates, and more corporate accountability. At the state level, Republican governors and other officials are finding new ways to block major Wall Street firms from state business, including managing pension funds and bond issues, if they apply ESG principles to other parts of their portfolios.

Nationally, the broadsides against ESG bolster calls to abandon, or at least relax, environmental standards in favor of “energy independence.” It’s also a partisan issue at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is trying to require companies to report on their greenhouse gas emissions. In a virtual meeting on the plan in March, the agency’s only Republican commissioner, Hester Peirce, turned off her camera in protest, saying that she was trying to reduce her carbon footprint.

Republicans are increasingly using banks and “woke” companies as cudgels for their base voters, said Reed Galen, a co-founder of the anti-Trump group, The Lincoln Project. “If you’re taking on a company who has environmental and social justice goals, you don't have to explain ESG to the voters. All you have to do is say ‘woke corporation.’”

In the past few years, as the world became more aware of the risks posed by global warming and social unrest, financial firms have rushed to offer investments that promise to account for those risks — and maybe even minimize them. With an ESG slant on everything from loans to complex derivatives, assets are set to balloon to $50 trillion worldwide by 2025, according to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence.

In the US, a big proportion of that is via public pension funds, which are overseen by state or local officials, or in private sector retirement plans, and receive preferential tax treatment. In response to new federal rules that would allow pension funds to consider ESG alongside traditional fiduciary factors in making investing decisions, almost two dozen states registered their objection, saying the rules would allow investments to be guided by “social causes and corporate goals, even if it adversely affects the return to the employee.”

Those states are increasingly considering legislative action. State lawmakers and treasurers have for years been concerned that politically motivated investing strategies reduce long-term profits, said Jonathan Williams, chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council. The conservative group, which writes model legislation, is looking to prevent public pensions from making investments using ESG.

Credit ratings agency S&P Global Inc. also has come under fire for using ESG information to evaluate municipal debt. In West Virginia, Moore joined several state treasurers last month to demand the ratings agency drop ESG factors from its rating system. His state got a negative social score and a moderately negative environmental score, signaling higher risk than the vast majority of states, which are rated neutral.

“The ESG movement is nothing but a slippery slope,” Moore said, cautioning that states will be forced to “bend the knee to the woke capitalists or suffer financial harm.”

S&P Global declined to comment on specific states and instead referred to a paper it published May 9 explaining how its ESG credit indicators work.

Kentucky, Texas and West Virginia have passed legislation that requires financial firms to say whether they have policies that limit doing business with oil, gas and coal companies, a common practice for firms that have made pledges to reduce their own carbon footprint. Banks that demur could lose their licenses in those states. Another 12 states are considering similar measures.

“Once ESG becomes commingled with corporate wokeness, it can become a powerful way for anti-corporate right wingers to talk about it and galvanize voters,’’ said Chris Stirewalt, an expert in US politics, voting trends and public opinion at free-market think tank American Enterprise Institute.

In addition to shunning oil, gas and coal producers as part of climate change policies, investors and employees have encouraged companies in recent years to take positions on LGBTQ rights, gun control and other issues that add to rancor among Republican voters.

Most recently, companies have begun to address the third rail of political issues: abortion. In March, Citigroup Inc. made waves when it said it would cover the travel and medical costs for any of its employees who needed to cross state lines to seek an abortion or other reproductive health care. In response, a Texas lawmaker said the bank could face criminal charges under that state’s abortion law, and Republican members of Congress called for the cancellation of US government contracts with Citigroup, which provides the credit cards that members of the US House of Representatives use to pay for flights, supplies and other goods.

Spokespeople for Citigroup and BlackRock declined to comment. A spokesman for Thiel didn't respond to messages, nor did representatives for Tesla, run by Musk.

Few expect the Republican attacks on ESG to vaporize the industry. As of now, roughly $3.4 trillion of public retirement money is invested in line with ESG strategies of some sort, according to the sustainable-investing industry group US SIF. Some of the bigger, more liberal states like California and New York are pushing for more restrictive ESG screens for state funds, not less. What’s more, many of the world’s biggest financial institutions have their own goals to cut emissions, which include reducing the amount of business they do with heavy polluters — whether they bill it as ESG or not. Many also have set targets for workforce diversity and elevating women in management, neither of which are politically popular among the right.

Still, the political pressure seems to be taking a toll. BlackRock sent a letter this week to the Texas state comptroller, rebutting the assertion that the firm boycotts the oil and gas industries, and Fink has made it clear he opposes divesting from fossil-fuel companies. The firm also said this year that it won’t back as many shareholder efforts to push companies to reduce their emissions compared with 2021. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is also taking steps to re-establish itself in Texas’s muni-bond market, about eight months after a new law forced that bank out of most deals because of its policies on guns and fossil fuels.

And if Wall Street’s usual suspects can’t be persuaded, others are eager to step in. With the backing of hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and Thiel, Vivek Ramaswamy, a pharmaceutical investor and author of “Woke Inc.,” has started an investing firm that attempts to be an antidote to the “political agendas” and “stakeholder capitalism” of bigger money managers.

In Utah, state treasurer Oaks pointed to real pain points for his constituency. Dixie Power, for example, which delivers power to roughly 25,000 customers, recently learned its longtime auto insurer wouldn’t renew coverage. The utility owns a coal-burning power plant and has stakes in two others, and the insurance company is phasing out business with companies that derive profits from coal, according to Colin Jack, the firm’s chief operating officer. The co-op is also set to lose insurance coverage for its coal mine from Lloyd’s of London for the same reason.

Fueled by frustration with that and what he sees as other government intrusion into the energy sector, Jack is running as a Republican for a seat in the Utah state legislature.

He may be in line for a powerful endorsement. On Wednesday, less than three hours after tweeting that ESG is a scam, Musk wrote that although he’d voted Democrat in the past, “I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.”

As an investor, there is always a dislike for any deep market correction. In particular, if there are substantial long positions. However, it’s the market correction that provides an entry opportunity into growth stocks as well as oversold blue-chip stocks.

Patient investors are always ready with some cash buffer to take a fresh plunge on declines. Warren Buffett’s investment style always serves as a good example. In the first few months of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway has been on a shopping spree with nearly $51 billion in share purchases.

Over decades, the markets have been trending higher. This underscores the view of buying on dips. In the recent correction, growth stocks have been hammered and there are some attractive entry opportunities. At the same time, some blue-chip stocks have also corrected from all-time highs.

7 Dividend Stocks to Boost Your Retirement Savings

This column will focus on five oversold blue-chip stocks. These are well-established, large market capitalization companies, that have rewarded investors through dividends, share repurchases and stock upside. The correction therefore provides a good entry opportunity for the core long-term portfolio.

AAPL Apple Inc. $137.35 PFE Pfizer Inc. $50.65 BTI British American Tobacco p.l.c. $42.85 COST Costco Wholesale Corporation  $422.93 TSLA Tesla, Inc. $709.42

Among technology stocks, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) would be my top-pick to buy at oversold levels. It’s one of the stocks that Warren Buffett has accumulated during the Q1 2022 sell-off.

AAPL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 23.2. Valuations look attractive considering the earnings growth potential. Additionally, the stock is among the quality dividend growth names to add to the portfolio.

In terms of business, iPhone remains the cash cow for Apple. With 5G phones, sales are likely to remain healthy. At the same time, Apple has diversified with growth in segments like wearable and services. These emerging segments have supported earnings growth.

With innovation in the forefront, the stock is likely to remain a value creator. Investors would also be eagerly waiting for more news on a potential electric vehicle. That’s another catalyst on the horizon. Apple has a robust cash buffer to make big investments in EV technology.

Overall, I expect AAPL stock to trend higher from current levels. Anything below $150 seems like a good entry point.

Pfizer Here's How Pfizer Stock (and Pharma) Stand to Benefit From Mylan Deal

Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com

For year-to-date 2022, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock has corrected by 10%. For a low-beta stock that’s undervalued, the correction is meaningful. The stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 7.6 and also offers investors an attractive dividend yield of 3.1%.

It’s worth noting that the company’s revenue growth will decelerate on a relative basis. A key reason is lower revenue from the vaccine against Covid-19. However, that’s not the only growth catalyst for the company.

Pfizer has a deep pipeline of drug candidates that will support growth in the next few years. Additionally, the company has a strong cash buffer for acquisitions. The company has already been on an acquisition spree in the last two quarters.

7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Investors Catch On

This will further boost the growth potential. As an example, the acquisition of ReViral has the potential to add $25 billion in risk-adjusted revenue to 2030 top-line expectations. Steady top-line and earnings growth would also imply potentially higher dividends.

PFE stock is therefore among the top names among oversold blue-chip stocks. Further, with increasing probability of a recession in 2023, the defensive stock is worth holding in the portfolio.

British American Tobacco British American Tobacco (BTI) logo on a building

British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) is another stock that has not corrected very significantly from highs. However, at a forward P/E of 9.3x, the stock is attractive. In particular, with a dividend yield of 6.57% with that payout being sustainable.

British American is in a business transformation phase with increased focus on the non-combustible business segment. There are two important points to note here.

First and foremost, the company’s core tobacco business still remains the cash cow. While growth is muted, the segment cash flows are likely to remain robust.

Furthermore, the growth in non-combustible business has been encouraging. This segment revenue is already 12% of the group revenue and has been growing at a CAGR of 44% (2017 to 2021). The company expects new-category revenue to increase to five billion pounds by 2025.

The company has also deleveraged with healthy cash flows. At a debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA of 3.0x, the balance sheet looks strong. Therefore, the business developments have been positive and BTI stock seems poised for a break-out rally.

In April 2022, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock had touched highs of $612. Currently, the stock is trading at $423, which implies a correction of about 30% from highs. I believe that it’s a good opportunity to accumulate the stock.

A major reason for the correction is weak results and earnings guidance from the retail sector. Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are among the stocks that have declined.

However, it’s worth noting that the consumption sector is the backbone of the U.S. economy. Retail spending is a key component of consumption spending. Retail stocks are likely to stabilize and trend higher again after discounting potential margin compression.

Specific to Costco, the company has reported sales of $130 billion for the thirty-one weeks ended April 3. On a year-on-year basis, sales growth was healthy at 16.7%. The company’s membership fee revenue has also increased over the years.

7 Dividend Stocks to Boost Your Retirement Savings

I also like the fact that Costco has been building strong omni-channel sales presence. Overall, the membership warehouse operator is well positioned for steady long-term growth. Near-term headwinds in the form of margin pressure provide a good opportunity to accumulate COST stock.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is another name among oversold blue-chip stocks to buy. From 52-week highs of $1,243, TSLA stock has corrected by 42% to current levels of $72os.

There has been a broad-based correction in electric vehicle stocks. Chip shortage, raw material inflation and surge in Covid cases in China are near-term headwinds. However, the industry has multi-year tailwinds and I expect a strong bounce-back for TSLA stock.

In terms of business developments, Tesla Cybertruck and Roadster are likely to be launched in 2023. The company has also opened order bookings for Tesla Semi. This will support deliveries growth in the next few years.

It’s also worth noting that Tesla already has a Gigafactory in Europe. With the region focused on reducing energy dependence on Russia, the outlook for accelerated adoption of EV is positive.

With operating leverage, Tesla has already been reporting healthy cash flows. In the next few years, free cash flows are likely to swell. This will take TSLA stock higher.

714,Elon Musk is not happy with a meme mocking his new-found attention to Twitter,"Elon Musk got defensive on Thursday evening after a meme suggested he may be spending a little too much time on Twitter and not enough time on his electric vehicle company.

“To be clear, I’m spending <5% (but actually) of my time on the Twitter acquisition. It ain’t rocket science!” the Tesla CEO exclaimed in a tweet, attached with a photo of the meme.

The meme shows a woman walking past a couple, distracting the boyfriend and annoying the man's girlfriend. The woman walking past was Twitter, the disapproving other woman was Tesla, and the distracted man was of course Elon Musk.

Musk may feel the need to defend his Twitter acquisition in order to soothe investor worries over the declining share price of Tesla, which has fallen by 28% since Musk first offered to acquire the social network for $44 billion on Apr. 14.

Since launching his bid to take Twitter private, $285 billion has been wiped off Tesla's market capitalization and Musk's net worth has sunk by $49 billion.

Musk added a series of new Tesla milestones to prove that his attention wasn't waning, including his recently opened Giga Texas factory and SpaceX's Starbase rocket launch site in Boca Chica, Texas.

He said “Tesla is on my mind 24/7,"" adding “So may seem like below, but not true.”

The defensive stance comes a day after an article was published by Insider claiming Musk had exposed himself to a flight attendant on SpaceX and sexually propositioned her.

Musk characterized the story as a ""politically motivated hit piece.""

Waning attentions and calls for a buyback

The value of Tesla began to fall precipitously after Musk first revealed that he had bought a near 10% stake in Twitter on Apr. 4.

By the time he made a formal offer to buy Twitter 10 days later, Tesla shares had fallen by 14% and on the day Musk's buyout offer was accepted, shares in Tesla slid another 12%.

Musk's defensive stance also comes a day after Tesla got kicked out of the S&P sustainability ESG index. Shares in the company fell another 6% Thursday amid a wider market tumble.

Leo KoGuan, a Singapore-based billionaire and Tesla's third-largest individual investor, on Thursday called on Tesla to buy back shares, indicating some investors may be getting restless over the nosedive in the electric vehicle company's share price. Tesla has never paid a cash dividend or bought back its shares, instead choosing to reinvest everything into its business to finance further growth.

""Tesla must announce immediately and buy back $5 billion of Tesla shares from its free cash flow this year and $10 billion from its free cash flow next year, without effecting its existing $18 billion cash reserves with ZERO debt,"" KoGuan said in a Twitter message to Tesla's head of investor relations, Martin Viecha.

“We, Tesla bulls, need more support,” KoGuan tweeted, pointing to the company’s cash reserves, tweeting ""Tesla can invest in (Full Self-Driving), bot and factories while buying back its undervalued stocks. Shock and wake up few braindead analysts to their senses.""

KoGuan finished the Twitter note with his full support of Tesla, saying ""Whenever I have cash, I have been buying Tesla shares and keep these shares until 2030 or longer. Forever and ever.""

715,Musk’s Questions About Twitter Bot Problem Spur Race for Answer,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk has said that his $44 billion purchase of Twitter Inc. hinges on the accuracy of one figure: the number of bots on the platform. That’s triggered a race for answers.

Twitter indicates in regulatory filings that the number of automated accounts is less than 5% of the total, but Musk has said he suspects that the number is much larger. If he can demonstrate that Twitter’s figures are inaccurate, the billionaire may attempt to use the information to get out of the deal or negotiate a lower price.

Though many outside estimates do put the figure above the 5% threshold, their assessments and methodologies vary. Andrea Stroppa, a former data consultant for the World Economic Forum and a veteran of scrutinizing online counterfeit goods, estimates that bot accounts have accounted for about 10% of Twitter’s global audience over the past nine years.

The rate rises to as much as 20% for some specific topics such as cryptocurrencies, the researcher said, and above 30% for accounts engaged in certain conspiracy theories.

The research firm Bot Sentinel, meanwhile, estimates that 10% to 15% of accounts on Twitter are inauthentic. That includes fakes, spammers, scammers, nefarious bots, duplicates and single-purpose hate accounts. Inauthentic accounts are more likely to tweet about politics, cryptocurrency, climate change and Covid-19 than less controversial topics like kittens and origami, Bot Sentinel has found. Cyabra, a research firm with a different methodology, puts the percentage of inauthentic Twitter profiles at 13.7%.

Twitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Story continues

Musk said this week that spam bots amount to at least 20% of Twitter’s total, and he asked whether the true figure could be as high as 80% or 90%. He tweeted out a meme on Thursday jokingly suggesting that Twitter is “all bots.”

But it may be hard to use the issue to get out of buying Twitter, said Adam Badawi, a professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley.

“To have leverage, he would need to show that the difference between the true number of bots and the amount Twitter disclosed in its SEC filings rises to the level of a ‘material adverse effect,’” he said. “That’s M&A jargon for a complete calamity. He’d probably need to show that over half of Twitter’s users are not real.”

Musk, the head of Tesla Inc. and the world’s richest person, agreed last month to acquire Twitter and take it private for $44 billion. After that, as Musk sought to shore up financing for the transaction, he showed signs of wavering. He said last week that the deal was “on hold” until he gets more information, specifically proof from Twitter that so-called spam bots make up less than 5% of its users.

Earlier this week, Musk stoked speculation that he could seek to renegotiate the takeover, saying at a tech conference in Miami that a viable deal at a lower price wouldn’t be “out of the question.” But the transaction isn’t officially on hold or being renegotiated; Musk is still contractually committed to it.

Musk likely has a different experience with bots on the platform than most. Those designing automated accounts program them to follow popular users on a site, so that they fit in with the crowd and look more human. Musk, with a following of 94 million, probably attracts a higher percentage of bots than most users. His image has also been used by cryptocurrency accounts to run scams.

That said, bots are indeed more of an issue for Twitter than other platforms, Stroppa said.

“Twitter’s bot detection software is much weaker than other social media,” he said. On Twitter, you can run a botnet using outdated techniques and don’t need sophisticated tools such as Android emulators and 4G proxies, which can mimic customers using a mobile phone, Stroppa said. Professional botnets on Twitter are stealthy, especially the ones used for digital propaganda, he added.

Bots also aren’t against Twitter’s rules. Some are comedic or useful in other ways, such as one that automatically tweets out the magnitude of earthquakes.

With hot-button issues such as the pandemic, automated activity tends to be higher. Carnegie Mellon University researchers collected more than 200 million tweets discussing coronavirus or Covid-19 from January 2020 to June 2020. Of the top 50 influential accounts retweeting material, 82% were bots, they found. Of the top 1,000 retweeters, 62% were bots.

But the overall number may be close to unknowable, even by Twitter -- and it’s not even clear what constitutes a bot.

“I suspect that this will be drawn out in courts,” Duke University professor Chris Bail said. “Because reasonable people can disagree on what is or what isn’t a bot.”

720,"Texas is a ‘very friendly place’ for business, Canyon Partners co-founder says","Texas continues to be a hotbed for corporate relocations — last year, 62 corporations moved their headquarters to the Lone Star State. According to Canyon Partners co-CEO and co-founder Josh Friedman, the healthy business environment is what is spurring companies to make the move.

“Texas is a very friendly place for businesses,” Friedman said in an interview with Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer as part of Influencers with Andy Serwer. “If you look at firms like Goldman Sachs (GS) and others, Goldman is moving literally thousands of employees there. I think sometimes a change of venue or an additional venue injects an element of excitement and growth into a firm.”

Friedman also noted the benefits Texas offers to employees and other individuals choosing to relocate.

“And I think for our younger employees, they are enjoying a much lower cost of living. Almost everyone has bought a home. And those homes have all appreciated because of [the way the] environment is toward business,” he added. “Their commute to work is short. The cost of gas is relatively lower. They have a variety of educational alternatives from public schools to private schools, all of them at or lower in cost substantially than [in] California.”

In this episode of Influencers, Friedman sat down with Serwer at the Milken Conference in Los Angeles to discuss the debt market, inflation worries, and the reason Canyon Partners moved its headquarters to Texas. Canyon Partners LLC is an employee-owned hedge fund founded by Friedman and Mitchell Julis in 1990 with offices in Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, London, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo, and Shanghai.

Tech giants like Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL) have also famously set up shop in Texas. Tesla’s Gigafactory Texas now serves as its global headquarters and is slated to become the manufacturing hub for the highly anticipated Cybertruck, while Apple has a $1 billion campus in northwest Austin in the works.

Texas appears to be particularly attractive for companies and individuals looking to move out of California. Silicon Valley companies especially are beginning to flee high housing costs, high taxes, and a strict regulatory environment in favor of the lower costs of living and friendlier tax laws offered by Texas.

Story continues

For companies on the East Coast, Florida is a popular relocation destination for similar reasons that Texas is favored by western companies. Florida added more tech companies in 2021 than any other state for a total of 2,715 tech businesses. However, Friedman believes that Texas still reigns supreme in terms of cost of living when compared to the Sunshine State.

“California, in many respects, [is] like Miami, Florida,” he said. “While Miami has a lower tax regime than California, it does have a lot of the complexities of a high cost of living and a high cost of housing and a lot of those urbanization issues that aren't quite so prevalent in Dallas.”

Video Transcript

JULIE HYMAN: Thing number three. I mean, we're talking about Elon Musk again. This time, he's under fire after Business Insider article claimed that Musk sexually harassed a flight attendant and then paid this flight attendant and SpaceX through SpaceX $250-- $250,000-- $250 wouldn't be very much-- $250,000 to cover it up in 2018. Musk responded on Twitter, of course, stating that those wild accusations are utterly untrue.

And a couple of things to note here, the incident allegedly happened in 2016. Then this $250,000 severance was allegedly paid in 2018. This insider article mostly cites a friend of the accuser, who talked about all of this stuff happening. Musk pushing back against it on Twitter and really sort of saying, it feeds into the narrative of him as under fire, under political fire, and that this has to do with him being attacked once he said that he was going to vote Republican. Or maybe one of the other narratives he put forward is, it has to do with his quest to buy Twitter, and that this is an attempt to derail that in some way. So kind of alleging that this is a politically motivated attack from various sides.

BRAD SMITH: But got to look at the history of how his companies have also had allegations, even, of racial discrimination come forward. There have been lawsuits that Tesla has had to put under settlements instead of seeing it fully play out in court, because in that case, a company run by Elon Musk, at the end of the day, would not want the stain of having lost a legal argument in that case in order to have that stain of them being looked at as a racially discriminatory company.

In the same case, you would rather, in SpaceX's instance here, they would rather, much rather, go through with a settlement out of court, instead of seeing them labeled as a company that also has a story that very much could have been, at the time, been squarely at the front page of the MeToo movement as well.

JULIE HYMAN: To be fair, this is the first allegation we have heard regarding him personally. Most of the former racial discrimination lawsuits or other types of workplace that was not a fair workplace had to do with the systems in place, right? It didn't have to do with Musk himself. And this is the first that I'm aware of sexual harassment allegation against him directly. And he points that out. He says, in the 30 years that I've been in public life, this has not come forward before. It doesn't mean it didn't happen. But it's something that we, as the public and as the media, did not hear about before.

Is it going to do anything to his attempt to buy Twitter? It doesn't feel like it at this point. I mean, at the same time, we have to look at what else is going on with Musk right now. And it's interesting you bring up the discrimination lawsuit because this week, of course, Tesla was taken out of one of the ESG pegged ETFs. And he was very vocal about that, saying that that should not have happened, which had been linked to some of these workplace allegations. So it's interesting, then, to get this allegation made public at the end of that kind of week.

BRAD SMITH: There is no shortage of headlines around Elon Musk right now, but--

JULIE HYMAN: Well, there's one more I want to mention, too.

BRAD SMITH: Yes, yes.

JULIE HYMAN: And that has to do with Ark, Ark Investment, Cathie Wood's firm, of course. Tesla is no longer the top holding in ARKK, which is her benchmark ETF. The shares worth about $703 million as of Thursday's close, her holding in Tesla. Roku now the top holding, $717 million.

Now, that's according to the data that they come out daily. Bloomberg compiled it and sort of came out with this number. But they have been working down those Tesla shares, 1.59 million Tesla shares as of the end of March, 5.79 million shares a year earlier. So that stake has been getting smaller, which is sort of interesting because, obviously, she has been-- it's still a big stake.

BRAD SMITH: Right.

JULIE HYMAN: But she has been one of his biggest backers.

BRAD SMITH: Interesting. Still so bullish on Roku winning perhaps the streaming wars.

JULIE HYMAN: We'll see how that works out.

BRAD SMITH: Indeed.",2022-05-20T13:42:58+00:00
726,Deal or No Deal Twitter Stock Is a Buy Now,"Twitter (TWTR) stock is under fire on Wall Street. This is presenting a multitude of opportunities. Ignore the headlines and trade the current stock facts. In this photo illustration the Twitter logo seen displayed on a smartphone with the Elon Musk's official Twitter profile

Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com

Recently Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock owners went through a wide gamut of emotions. The drama actually started in March, as the stock soared 30% on rumors. Then the offer became official, and the drama started. Last week, the prospective buyer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk halted the deal. Consequently TWTR stock jubilation ended violently and it is now trying to recover. Today’s conclusion is that the dip is an opportunity to invest into it going into the summer.

Investors should know what to expect by now when Mr. Musk is involved. The sequence of events brought about opportunities for a multitude of investment styles. The arbitrage folks had a field day with the mile-wide differential between the offer and price. Also TWTR swung wildly +/- 20%, which gave momentum traders opportunities galore. Now that it completely collapsed back to the base, it is time for value investors to play.

Confused? Don’t feel bad because according to Yahoo Finance, most analysts are also unsure. Most of them are on “Hold” with it, but their average price target is $52 per share. This is just under the potential buyout bid, which is not completely dead. The deal may have to go through unless Mr. Musk can wiggle out of the break-up $1 billion penalty and accompanying legal woes.

TWTR Twitter $37.29

Deal Seesaw Temporary Broke TWTR Stock

Normally, I avoid politics like the plague especially for investing purposes. But in this case, it is part of the thesis. Mr. Musk was trying to make a political point more than invest for profit. Twitter banned many high profile right-wing users. The most famous one of them all was ex-president Donald Trump. Part of the buyout conversation was that new management would address, and likely reverse, these bans to promote “free speech.”

Right or wrong, the topic is now out in the open. It is no longer a concept but rather a reality. In the end, the deal will happen, or not based on the fundamentals. If the economics work for both parties, they will come to terms. After all they are in the business of making money, not political points. Besides, maybe now other interested parties may step up. Knowing a going rate for a company is an invitation to bid.

The fundamentals for Twitter have improved in the last few years. They are no longer purely hunting user metrics, but rather financial success. Revenues have doubled in five years, they even made a profit. Last year they generated $800 million in cash from operations. While the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio doesn’t show it, TWTR is cheap from a price-to-sales (P/S) perspective. Owners of the stock now have reasonable expectations.

The Fiasco Will Not Last Forever Twitter (TWTR) Stock Chart Showing Pivotal Zone

Source: Charts by TradingView

TWTR stock is now at a very pivotal point. This is where it was at the start of the pandemic, and that summer’s mega breakout. Current price is also below its initial public offering (IPO), so the opportunity to own it fresh is upon us. Moreover, $38 per share had also been pivotal in 2015 and 2018. Clearly the data suggests that investors care about it now. The February lows offer a solid support line for the bulls to use as footing.

There is external risk because of the equities struggles in general. There is rampant fear that the Federal Reserve will tank the economy. The Fed’s rate hikes and rhetoric have damaged Wall Street’s risk appetite in the past few weeks. Add to this the geopolitical risks, and you get a lack of bids. But that’s when the best opportunities emerge.

When not many are looking to buy TWTR stock, the bargain becomes available. There is an opportunity for a potential recover to $50 per share in the next few months. Owning shares at these levels is a reasonable risk for the available reward.

TSLA daily chart

Shares have fallen back to support near $700. This area held in February. With widespread market weakness, we believe Tesla is more vulnerable than ever to a sharp breakdown – prices MUST hold $680 in May.

Takeaway

Tesla could break key support in the coming days. A daily close below $680 could spark significant selling.

To be fair I thought Tesla should have broken below $700 back in February, but prices held. Will it hold again? I’d be surprised.

Key Price Levels

The first level of support arrives at $550; below that, a quick trip to $420 would be in the cards.

Tesla and Twitter

The uncertainty regarding Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter is becoming an anchor that could drag Tesla shares lower.

We think a potential trigger event could be Elon Musk needing to sell more TSLA to finance TWTR. If selling becomes epic – we could see a waterfall type decline.

An apology is in order. I really believed Elon Musk would close on Twitter (NASDAQ:TWTR) when I wrote about the deal two weeks ago.

He had a firm offer on the table. He had the financing lined up. The Twitter board had taken the deal.

The Twitter board is still for the deal, but that’s now more of a threat than a promise. Since my story was published TWTR stock is down 25%, while the Nasdaq is down just 6%.

7 Dividend Stocks to Boost Your Retirement Savings

Twitter investors aren’t the only people in trouble here. Elon Musk has his credibility gap back.

TWTR Twitter $37.25

Believe Me?

If you use Twitter, and I do, Musk’s reputation has gone from that of Henry Ford to Charles Ponzi faster than you can say Bernie Madoff.

His own net worth has dropped by $49 billion, more than he bid for the social networking company.

Twitter’s board says they have an agreement to sell at $54.20 and they intend to enforce it, despite Musk’s efforts to back off, claiming that many Twitter handles are bots.

Meanwhile shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which Musk was using as collateral, have also plunged, down by one-third in the last month. Musk is still the world’s wealthiest person. Forbes lists his fortune at $214 billion. But that’s “just” $71 billion ahead of the new number two, Bernard Arnault of the luxury conglomerate LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY).

Musk’s own tweet thread, meanwhile, smells of desperation. He has trolled critics, come out as a Republican, and sought to laugh everything off. (He thinks “Elongate” a great name for his latest personal scandal.)

What of Twitter and TWTR Stock?

Meanwhile, five top executives have left Twitter and one even mocked Musk’s Asperger’s Syndrome.

Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal has tried to conduct business as usual. He announced a crisis misinformation policy aimed at halting the amplification of falsehoods in times of crisis. He fired two executives, saying the company wanted “a different direction.” He has tried to improve Twitter’s reputation in his native India. He has sought to project a reassuring image, despite reports that he has already been fired.

Lost in all this are Twitter’s financials. Twitter earned $513 million, 61 cents/share fully diluted, on revenue of $1.2 billion during the first quarter. Sounds good, but the earnings all came from the sale of MoPub, a monetization system, for $1.2 billion. Absent that one-time gain Twitter lost $127 million from operations.

Twitter is next due to report earnings July 28, with just 6 cents/share of profit expected on revenue of $1.33 billion. This means at the company’s May 20 market capitalization of $28.5 billion, you’re paying 5.5 times the estimated $5.2 billion in 2022 revenue to own TWTR stock, which is only marginally profitable. (At the deal price Musk is paying 8.5 times revenue.)

The Bottom Line on TWTR Stock

I have no idea at this point if the Twitter-Musk deal will go through.

It should. The two sides had a firm agreement. The $1 billion termination fee might look cheap, but it’s conditional. Twitter could probably get a lot more out of him by suing.

As an investment, TWTR stock is overpriced in the current environment. But Agrawal has shown he’s a talented executive. If he stays, he could justify the company’s current price in time. Especially with a few billion dollars of Musk money in the corporate coffers.

733,Tesla relegated to the backseat in Cathie Wood’s ARK fund as woes mount for Elon Musk,"Elon Musk’s Tesla was relegated to the backseat in Cathie Wood’s flagship fund behind Roku, as his repeated Twitter tantrums continued to scare investors away.

According to her Ark Invest website, the streaming service provider now makes up nearly 8.4% of her Ark Innovation exchange traded fund, versus just over 8.2% for Tesla and other major holdings like video conferencing provider Zoom.

https://twitter.com/TicTocTick/status/1527619608856756225?s=20u0026t=wKKQH1jXShrnj-c4Utbf-w

At the end of March, Tesla still made up 9.7% of her ETF’s portfolio with Roku comprising only 6.4% of its overall value.

The news fuelled current bearish sentiment towards the stock triggered by an Insider report his other company, SpaceX, had paid an employee hush money to cover up a potential sex scandal.

Musk denied the claims.

Shares in the centibillionaire’s car company tumbled nearly 7% on Friday to new lows not seen since August, completely erasing a short relief rally on the back of stock buyback hopes.

By comparison, Roku and Ark Innovation both dropped only about 3% amid a 1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

Has Wood dumped more Tesla stock?

Ark Innovation bets exclusively on high risk, high growth stocks Wood believes offers maximum exposure to disruptive technologies.

These include artificial intelligence, genome sequencing, blockchain technologies and robotics. Traditionally Tesla has been her highest conviction buy, as it cuts across a number of these emerging tech trends.

Recently Wood’s team even came out with a $4,600 price target for Tesla for 2026, which if accurate would offer a near sevenfold upside potential from current levels.

Unlike her recent decision to trim her Tesla holdings to free up cash for an investment in General Motors, however, there’s no indication that Wood dumped any further shares in Musk’s company.

Instead it appears as if Roku’s share price performance organically led to it surpassing Tesla as Wood’s largest single position.

This hasn't been a help for Wood, however, as her Ark Innovation ETF is currently down 57% since the start of this year.

“Tesla is mainly down on two things -- macroeconomic concerns as people are worried about inflation and recession, and China,” Gary Black, founder and managing partner at the actively-managed ETF Future Fund LLC, said in an interview.

The electric-vehicle maker’s difficulties in China have become impossible to ignore, with multiple Wall Street analysts this week warning about the country’s disruptions weighing on Tesla’s results. The shares have also been caught up in the growth-stock selloff as investors shun risky assets amid soaring global inflation.

Like most automakers, Tesla is facing crippling supply shortages and soaring raw material costs. Though it has been able to navigate the troubles better than most, the latest coronavirus outbreak in China that led to multiple production disruptions at its factory in Shanghai has been damaging to the shares.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas warned that the China supply wobble could potentially drive a “substantial” miss on deliveries in the second quarter. Analysts’ average estimate for Tesla’s second-quarter deliveries now stand at around 303,000 units, down 12% from the end of March, according to Bloomberg data. On Thursday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives lowered his price target on the stock by 29% to $1000.

Also not helping is the uncertainty surrounding Chief Executive Elon Musk’s high profile bid to takeover Twitter.

“As long as the Twitter deal is out there, and as long as Tesla’s stock is falling, people worry that Musk will have to sell more stock and would get distracted and not pay as much attention to Tesla as he should,” Black said.

Story continues

Beyond the Twitter headlines, Tesla also was removed from the S&P 500 ESG Index, prompting questions about its position as a key sustainable energy investment. In response, Musk called ESG investing “an outrageous scam.”

Even with the 38% rout in Tesla shares this year, the stock is still among one of the priciest in the NYSE FANG+ Index of megacap technology stocks. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 56, compared with the index’s average of 21.

There also are a few things coming that could make Tesla investors optimistic. The company is expected to announce a stock split before its August shareholder meeting, a move that would make its lofty shares more affordable for retail traders and potentially boost its stock price. And earlier this week, Musk said the company’s AI Day event on Aug. 19 will feature a preview of its Optimus robot. A strong response to the technology development could help reverse the negative sentiment.

If you own a Tesla, or a loved one does, or you’re thinking about buying one, or you share public roads with Tesla cars, you might want to watch the new documentary “Elon Musk’s Crash Course.”

Premiering Friday on FX and Hulu, the 75-minute fright show spotlights the persistent dangers of Tesla’s automated driving technologies, the company’s lax safety culture, Musk’s P.T. Barnum-style marketing hype and the weak-kneed safety regulators who seem not to care.

Solidly reported and dead-accurate (I’ve covered the company since 2016 and can attest to its veracity), the project, part of the ongoing ""New York Times Presents"" series, may well become a historic artifact of the what-the-hell-were-they-thinking variety.

The central through line is the story of Joshua Brown, a rabid Tesla fan and derring-do techno-geek beheaded when his Autopilot-engaged Tesla drove itself at full speed on a Florida highway underneath the trailer of a semi-truck in 2016.

Whatever lessons were learned at Tesla did not prevent an almost identical fatal crash, also in Florida, three years later. An unknown number of Autopilot-related crashes have occurred since — unknown to anyone but Tesla, which has the ability to track its cars through wireless connections — because the government’s decades-old process for collecting crash statistics is unfit for the digital age. The company is currently under investigation by federal safety regulators for an apparent tendency to crash into emergency vehicles parked by the side of the highway.

Here are four more key takeaways from ""Elon Musk's Crash Course.""

1. Tesla's Autopilot feature did not receive adequate testing, ex-employees allege

The pressure to push Autopilot features out to customers fast, ready or not, was relentless, according to several former members of the Autopilot development team featured in the documentary. “There was no deep research phase” like at other driverless car companies, says one engineering program manager, with “customers essentially standing in for professional test drivers.”

Story continues

The testimony of these developers is a standout feature of ""Crash Course."" It’s rare to hear from insiders at Tesla because “free-speech absolutist” Musk makes employees sign strict nondisclosure agreements and enforces them with a vast army of well-paid lawyers.

When Brown’s car ran under the truck, the company said, the system mistook the side of the trailer for the bright sky, and blamed its camera provider. But inside Tesla, the Autopilot team was still struggling with how its software could distinguish a truck crossing a highway from an overhead bridge, says software engineer Raven Jiang: “The rate of learning wasn’t great. It was personally hard for me to believe the promise was going to be lived up to.”

The media were reporting on the Theranos fraud at the time, which provoked some “soul searching” for Jiang, who quit for another job. Akshat Patel, an Autopilot engineering program manager, echoes Jiang's concern. If anyone considers Tesla “an example of scientific integrity, public responsibility, and reasoned and methodical engineering,” Patel says, “it is not.”

2. Fully autonomous Teslas are more science-fiction than reality

Tesla currently sells a feature for $12,000 called Full Self-Driving, which is not full self-driving at all. Fully autonomous cars available to individual buyers do not exist.

But that hasn’t stopped Musk from claiming, year after year after year, that autonomous Teslas are right around the corner.

Clip after clip in ""Crash Course"" puts his false claims on display.

2014: “No hands, no feet, nothing,” he says from the wheel of a Tesla. “The car can do almost anything.”

2015: Musk tells a crowd he is “quite confident” autonomy will be achieved within three years, to the point where “you could be asleep the whole time.”

2016: “I think we’re basically less than two years away from full autonomy,” he tells journalist Kara Swisher on a conference stage.

2017: “We’re still on track to be able to go cross country from Los Angeles to New York by the end of the year, fully automated.”

2018: “By the end of next year self-driving will be at least 100% to 200% safer than a person.”

2019: Buying a car that does not include Full Self-Driving is “like buying a horse.”

2022: In a black cowboy hat and sunglasses: “The car will take you anywhere you want ultimately 10 times safer than if you were driving it yourself. It’s just going to completely revolutionize the world.”

The doc also explains how Tesla manipulated a widely shared video of a Tesla driving itself through the streets of Palo Alto a few months after Brown's death.

The revenue from Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, it should be noted, is largely responsible for meeting compensation goals that have made Musk so rich.

3. Musk's fans don't hold back. Even on camera

Among his 94 million Twitter followers, Musk has attracted a particularly rabid fan base, to which ""Crash Course"" gestures on occasion. (One tweet reads, “Elon is the Lord.”) But the documentary doesn’t go deep into why so many people seem so enthralled by him. That’s the realm of speculation, or perhaps psychology.

Still, there are some choice quotes from the Tesla fans and Musk supporters who sit for interviews, apparently unaware of the irony:

“I think Elon wants to make a dent in the world.”

“Any company would kill to have that level of fandom and devotion.”

“He has the resources that allow him to do things that would be irresponsible or insane to anybody else.”

4. Regulatory failures are part of the problem

Partway through ""Crash Course,"" viewers might begin wondering: Where are the safety regulators?

Great question. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigated the Brown crash, determined that Autopilot somehow missed the broad side of a truck in front of the car, and yet determined there was no defect, giving Tesla a pass.

“I was a little bit dumbfounded,” New York Times reporter Neal Boudette tells the camera. “The system couldn’t see the tractor trailer? And that’s not a defect?”

A communications official for NHTSA at the time attempts to explain: “It’s a little complicated and almost counterintuitive, right? Autopilot didn’t even engage to try to stop the crash. But the fact of the matter is, Autopilot wasn’t designed to stop every crash in every instance.”

The fact of the matter is too that several top NHTSA officials in both the Obama and Trump administrations went on to take jobs in the driverless car industry.

NHTSA under Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is getting tougher with Tesla on access to data, and its investigations remain ongoing.

Meanwhile, a high-speed Tesla crashed into a Newport Beach highway construction site on May 12. Three people were killed. Were Autopilot or Full Self-Driving involved? Police are looking into the incident, and NHTSA has opened an investigation.

738,Why Is Tesla (TSLA) Down 29.7% Since Last Earnings Report?,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Tesla (TSLA). Shares have lost about 29.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Tesla due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.

Tesla's Blockbuster Q1 Earnings Show

Tesla reported first-quarter 2022 earnings of $3.22 a share, growing significantly from the year-ago figure of 93 cents and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15. This marked the fifth straight earnings beat for the company.

Higher-than-expected deliveries and automotive gross profit resulted in this outperformance. Total first-quarter 2022 deliveries of 310,048 units topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 298,495. Automotive gross profit came in at $5,539 million, which outpaced the consensus mark of $4,113 million. Also, revenues from automotive regulatory credits totaled $679 million, breezing past the consensus mark of $301 million and rising 31% on a year-over-year basis.

Total revenues came in at $18,756 million, beating the consensus mark of $17,276 million. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 80.5%. Importantly, the EV giant reported an automotive gross margin of 32.9% and overall gross margin of 29.1% for the quarter. Further, operating margin came in at 19.2%.

Key Takeaways

Production and delivery totaled 305,407 and 310,048 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 69% and 68%, respectively. First-quarter 2022 marked the seventh consecutive quarter of ground-breaking deliveries by the world's most valuable automaker. The Model 3/Y registered production and deliveries of 291,189 and 295,324 vehicles, marking year-over-year growth of 61% and 62%, respectively. Production and delivery of the Model S/X totaled 14,218 and 14,724 units, respectively, for the quarter under review.

Story continues

Total automotive revenues of $16,861 topped the consensus mark of $15,080 million and surged 87% year over year. The figure also included $679 million from the sale of regulatory credits for electric vehicles, which rose 31% year over year. Automotive gross margin came in at 32.9%, expanding 636 basis points from first-quarter 2021.

Energy generation and storage revenues came in at $616 million for first-quarter 2022 compared with the year-ago period’s $494 million. Services and other revenues were up 43.2% year over year to $1,279 million.

Operating expenses totaled $1,857 million for the reported quarter, up from $1,621 million incurred in the corresponding period of 2021.

Financials

Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $17,505 million as of Mar 31, 2022 compared with $17,576 million on Dec 31, 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $3,995 million for first-quarter 2022, up 143.4% year on year. Its capital expenditure totaled $1,767 million, up from the $1,348 million recorded in first-quarter 2021.

Tesla generated free cash flow of $2,228 million during the quarter, up a whopping 660% year on year. Long-term debt and finance leases — net of current portion on Dec 31, 2021 — totaled $3,153 million, down from $5,245 million on Dec 31, 2021.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.

The consensus estimate has shifted 25.66% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

At this time, Tesla has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

739,This week in Bidenomics: Losing Musk and Bezos,"Elon Musk has finally come out, politically. He used to vote for Democrats, but henceforth can only vote for Republicans.

The Tesla CEO and President Biden ought to be natural allies. Biden has an ambitious green-energy agenda, including the mass electrification of automobiles. Musk leads the world’s most prominent electric vehicle company. They’re rowing in the same direction and ought to be in the same boat.

Instead, they’re splashing each other like 12-year-olds. Biden has miffed Musk by highlighting competitors such as General Motors and Ford for their work on EVs, even though both are miles behind Tesla. Biden plays up the Michigan automakers because they’re union shops. Tesla is not. Biden considers labor unions a core constituency and dissing Tesla is a sop to them.

Musk takes it personally. In January, on Twitter, Musk called Biden a “damp sock puppet.” In a May 16 podcast, Musk said, “It’s hard to tell what Biden is doing, to be totally frank. This administration, it doesn’t seem to get a lot done.”

Biden himself hasn’t responded to Musk, but a White House spokesman called Musk an “anti-labor billionaire,” while pointing to the large infrastructure bill Biden signed last November, which included several billion dollars for EV charging networks.

This silly spat is still a lost opportunity for Biden, who wants hundreds of billions of dollars in additional green-energy spending. That was in the “build back better” legislation that failed last year and doesn’t seem likely to make a comeback. An alliance with Musk wouldn’t automatically improve the prospects for that proposal, and Musk has criticized some proposed subsidies that would benefit other companies more than Tesla. But Biden and Musk still share a common cause, and Biden could gain a lot more by allying with Musk than by irritating him. Musk is an entrepreneurial and countercultural hero with 94 million Twitter followers. Why doesn’t Biden invite him to the White House to chat about the goals they have in common?

In fact, why not invite Jeff Bezos and settle with two anti-labor billionaires at once? That might settle another spat. The Amazon chairman picked a fight with Biden after a May 13 tweet Biden posted, saying the way to bring down inflation is to raise corporate taxes. This milquetoast pronouncement would be forgotten by now, except Bezos weighed in, calling it “disinformation,” then blamed high inflation on Democratic spending plans.

This gave the White House press corps something juicy to discuss with the new White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, other than the boring war in Ukraine and the nothing-to-see-here stock market. Jean-Pierre reminded everybody that Bezos is “one of the wealthiest individuals on earth” and said he “opposes an economic agenda for the middle class,” etc. etc. etc. Bezos bad.

Economists weighed in on whether Bezos had a point. The answer: A little. But there’s a lot more behind inflation than government spending. CNN rightly called the whole dust-up “the stupidest fight ever.”

Unlike President Trump before him, Biden rarely gets into personal battles with critics. His aides punch back on his behalf, but the genial Biden is an anodyne presence on Twitter, and he doesn’t really go negative unless prompted. Trump, of course, came out swinging at the slightest offense, and Biden, with some justification, clearly considers himself a calming, anti-Trump sedative for a riled nation.

So why doesn’t the diplomatic Biden reach out to Bezos and Musk? How about an olive branch? Biden, after all, is supposedly pals with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is overtly hostile to Biden’s presidential agenda works every day to block it. Agenda-wise, Biden has more in common with Musk and Bezos than with McConnell.

As the guy who built Amazon, Bezos is a logistics and supply-chain genius who could advise Biden on efforts to repair kinked distribution systems that are contributing to inflation. Musk has crucial knowledge on the scarce elements required for EV battery production, one of the supply problems that must be solved to produce EVs at massive scale. Pick their brains and show a little deference. Acknowledge things you disagree on—taxes, unions, whatever—then point to areas of agreement.

Of course, Bezos and Musk are both dastardly billionaires, and therefore enemies of the liberal Democrats Biden has spent his presidency trying to appease. Biden ran as a centrist and a capitalist, but his administration now sends the message that wealth is inherently bad. Bernie Sanders and AOC would howl if Biden cavorted with Musk or Bezos, so the cold shoulder will probably get colder. Who needs their votes, anyway?

743,"Analysis-Tesla brand threatened by Musk harassment claim, criticism of Democrats","By Hyunjoo Jin and Paul Lienert

(Reuters) - Elon Musk has made a name for himself and Tesla by breaking the rules, but the billionaire's latest comments on politics and a claim of sexual harassment against him that he said is untrue may hurt the brand in the eyes of some car owners and employees.

Musk on Thursday denied a report by Business Insider that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016, calling the person who made the claim a liar.

The previous day, the Tesla chief executive, in the midst of a contentious effort to buy Twitter Inc, said he would now vote Republican instead of Democrat and called the Democrats a ""party of division and hate.""

Tesla also was cut this week from the widely followed S&P 500 ESG Index, which an index executive said was due to issues including claims of racial discrimination within the company and crashes linked to its vehicles.

Musk responded by calling such ratings around environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues a ""scam,"" and questioned how the index could drop an electric car firm while adding oil and gas producers.

Tesla could not immediately be reached to comment.

While Musk has made attention-grabbing headlines before - once calling one critic a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter - the latest controversies again raise the question whether his outspokenness will tarnish his likeability. And - since Musk is so closely tied to Tesla - whether that will that hurt the carmaker's sales, especially in California.

The left-leaning state is Tesla's largest market, accounting for nearly 40% of the company's U.S. retail registrations last year, according to Experian data. Tesla sales in California were up almost 70% in the year and it had a 6.5% share of all vehicles in the state, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

#BoycottTesla was trending on Twitter on Friday and several people claimed they were canceling their car orders.

Story continues

""In the past, I admired him for working to build a green business that's transformational in energy use. But he is sadly becoming divisive as an attention seeking troll and I no longer trust that he is dedicated to the quality of his products. I will cancel my Tesla order,"" said J Yeh, a Twitter user who describes herself as a lawyer who has lived in several cities including Los Angeles.

""You lost a potential customer,"" a Twitter user named Ute Bauer from Germany said, adding in German: ""To anyone reading this, cancel your orders.""

Reuters was unable to confirm if any Tesla orders had been canceled.

Many institutional investors may stand by Musk no matter what given the company's strong performance, but that doesn't mean some aren't frustrated.

""They're doing a lot of good things,"" said Taylor Ogan, CEO of Snow Bull Capital, which owns Tesla shares. ""It's just disappointing when that is tainted by Elon Musk's antics. Elon Musk is the best thing for Tesla and the worst thing for Tesla.""

One Tesla employee, who asked not to be identified, voiced frustration that Musk's efforts outside Tesla appeared to be hurting the carmaker's stock. ""The company needs to do something to address the issue,"" he said.

On Friday, Tesla shares dropped almost 9%, knocking about $66 billion off of Tesla's stock market value and putting the stock at its lowest level since last August, with analysts citing ""distraction risks"" from the Twitter deal. Musk assured people on Thursday Tesla was constantly on his mind.

If discussion around water coolers at work focused on the sexual harassment claim against Musk rather than Tesla products, the end result could be ""corrosive"" for the Tesla brand, said John Smith, a former group vice president at GM who ran global product planning.

Tesla and SpaceX employees also could become ""a little bit rattled and angry"" because of Musk's anti-Democratic party comments as technology company staff in California tend to be more liberal, said Jason Stomel, founder of tech talent agency Cadre.

Bill Nelson, administrator of NASA, which relies on Musk's SpaceX to fly its astronauts to space, told Reuters on Thursday that Musk has a strong team of executives at the spacecraft maker and the agency's partnership with the company was ""going without a hitch.""

And Musk still has plenty of fans online. Twitter user @JVega103 said he was a Republican who owned a Tesla and just signed up for Tesla solar panels. ""Thanks for everything you do,"" the user tweeted.

That left some industry observers wondering whether Musk and Tesla would simply shake off these latest controversies, as they have in the past.

""Is Elon Musk now crazy, or crazy like a fox? He has earned the benefit of the doubt as he is often playing chess when the rest of us are playing checkers,"" Northwestern University professor Erik Qualman said. ""As Musk himself on 'Saturday Night Live' famously stated, 'What, did you think I would be normal?'""

* Ross Stores plunges after cutting 2022 forecast (Updates with details at end of session)

By Amruta Khandekar and Noel Randewich

May 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended mixed on Friday after a volatile session that saw Tesla slump and other growth stocks also lose ground.

Worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates have pummeled the U.S. stock market this year, with danger signals from Walmart Inc and other retailers this week adding to fears about the economy.

Wall Street opened stronger on Friday morning before turning sharply negative and adding to deep losses sustained earlier in the week.

The S&P 500 closed about 18% down from its Jan. 3 record high close. Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm it has been in a bear market since reaching that high, according to a common definition. That would be the S&P 500's second bear market since the 2020 global selloff caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last down close to 29% from its record close in November 2021.

Weighing heavily on the S&P 500, Tesla tumbled after Chief Executive Elon Musk denounced as ""utterly untrue"" claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016.

Other megacap stocks also fell, with Apple, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, Microsoft and Nvidia losing ground.

Shares of Deere & Co dropped after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue.

Recent disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart, Kohl's Corp and Target Inc have rattled market sentiment, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers.

On Friday, Ross Stores plunged after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 forecasts for sales and profit, while Vans brand owner VF Corp gained on strong 2023 revenue outlook.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001.

Story continues

The Dow is on track for its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression.

Traders are pricing in 50-basis point rate hikes by the U.S. central bank in June and July.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 0.72 points, or 0.02%, to end at 3,901.51 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 33.12 points, or 0.29%, to 11,355.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.81 points, or 0.03%, to 31,262.94.

Expiration of monthly options contracts on Friday was likely to boost trading volumes and could also add to volatility, especially toward the end of the session.

About two thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs.

As you can see on the chart here, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA) is down for its eighth-straight week.

On the upside, I have the $325 to $328 area as key. This was former support earlier in the year and has now failed, while the top of the zone marks the two-week high. Just above that is the declining 10-week moving average.

At some point, yes, I expect a bounce. Even then though, the bulls will need to have some caution on the rallies — remember, this is still a downtrend until proven otherwise.

Eventually, we will get out of this mess, but it seems too early to call the low. That said, if we get more downside in the ensuing days or weeks, keep an eye on the $292 to $300 area. There we find the rising 200-week moving average, the 38.2% retracement, and the pre-Covid highs.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) got whacked on Friday and fell 14% on the week. It marks Tesla’s fourth straight weekly decline as shares are now down almost 35% in that span.

The move sent the stock to fresh 2022 lows, but now bulls are looking for some support. On the downside, keep an eye on the $600 level, then the $540 to $550 zone. That was a key support zone in 2021.

Below that opens the door to the psychologically relevant $500 level, which is also a major breakout mark.

On the upside, however, it’s simple. Tesla stock needs to reclaim $700.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Ross Stores (ROST)

Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) is getting buried on earnings. On the chart, you may notice how key its retracement levels have been, particularly the 38.2% and 61.8% retracements.

It knifed through the latter this week, along with the 100-week moving average and the 78.6% retracement. Unless it can recover the latter — meaning a move above $73 — then Ross Stores stock is tough to buy from a technical analysis perspective.

On the downside, we could see $55 to $60 if the selling pressure doesn’t let up. Either way, I’d rather go with some of the high-quality retail stocks should they reclaim prior support levels vs. jumping into ROST stock right now, which is in no man’s land below $73.

Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Foot Locker (FL) Top stock trades for FL

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider

Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) was one of the few surprising gainers on the day, especially given how the stock has traded this year.

However, the stock has done a tremendous job holding the $28 level, something it did in the second quarter of 2020 as well.

I want to see how it does with the 10-week moving average, a measure it’s struggling with right now. If it can clear it and take out this week’s high, keep an eye on $36, which comes into play near the 61.8% retracement and the declining 21-week moving average.

Above that opens the door to $40.

On the downside, though, a break of $28 is a concern. It puts this year’s low in play at $26.36, then potentially even more lows.

* S&P 500 +0.01%, Nasdaq -0.30%, Dow +0.03% (Updates with details at end of session)

By Noel Randewich and Amruta Khandekar

May 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended mixed on Friday after a volatile session that saw Tesla slump and other growth stocks also lose ground.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001.

The Dow suffered its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression.

Worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates have pummeled the U.S. stock market this year, with danger signals from Walmart Inc and other retailers this week adding to fears about the economy.

The S&P 500 spent most of the session in negative territory and at one point was down just over 20% from its Jan. 3 record high close before ending down 18% from that level and flat for the day.

Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm the S&P 500 has been in a bear market since reaching that January high, according to a common definition.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last down about 27% from its record close in November 2021.

Weighing heavily on the S&P 500, Tesla tumbled 6.4% after Chief Executive Elon Musk denounced as ""utterly untrue"" claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016.

Other megacap stocks also fell, with Apple Google-owner Alphabet Inc down 1.3% and Nvidia losing 2.5%.

Shares of Deere & Co dropped 14% after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue.

Pfizer rose 3.6%, helping the S&P 500 avoid a loss for the day.

Recent disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart, Kohl's Corp and Target Inc have rattled market sentiment, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers.

The Nasdaq declined 0.30% to 11,354.62 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03% to 31,261.90 points.

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 3.0%, the Dow lost 2.9% and the Nasdaq declined 3.8%.

About two thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

- Well, it's been a wild ride on Wall Street not just today, but throughout the entire week, where volatility rules. And ultimately, end of the day, the NASDAQ down for the seventh straight week. That is the longest losing streak in 21 years. Jared Blikre is here to take a look at the numbers and the big picture takeaway. Hello, my friend.

JARED BLIKRE: Hello. Hello, guys, once here again. I want to take a five-day look at the S&P-- excuse me-- at the YFi Interactive, which I'm controlling remotely here. And we were just going over these numbers about an hour ago, and things looked pretty bad here.

You see Tesla right in the middle there. That's down 13.7%. That's this week alone. Apple is down 6.5%. And I compiled some stats here, and I'm going to be writing about this over the weekend. And I just want to show you guys.

The generals, as I've been talking about, the big guys are getting slaughtered right here. So this is a bubble graph. I'm going to be writing about this. So I'll explain it just more in the article.

But Apple is down an eye-watering $714 billion this year alone. We have Tesla down $435. $138 of that was this week alone. Alphabet down $509 billion. And you add all these up, it comes to about a cool trillion dollars just for some of the top names here.

So you've got to ask yourself, what's going to happen next with these guys?

- What is going to happen next? Because I think that's a question on everyone's mind right now, whether or not the selling that we saw this week, if it's going to continue.

JARED BLIKRE: The selling that we saw this week, it was just very orderly. And that's kind of a problem, because you take a look at some of the chart action here-- I'm going to go back to the YFi interaction and show you how orderly this selling was.

Now check this out. We're going to go back here, and we're going to pull up our world index map. And I'll show you exactly what's going on here, especially in the S&P 500. So here's today's price action, getting a little bit close to the D zone down here. But we did have that last hour rally. That's kind of a plus.

Story continues

But you take a look at what's happened over the last two days, the last three days, and the last five days, you don't see any capitulation signs in there, really. And that's kind of what you want to see before we hit that market bottom. So as I've been saying, I'm looking at Apple. I want to see Apple kind of capitulate here, not that I'm hoping for lower prices. I'm just looking for a bottom here. And I think we'll get that signal when it's down about 8% to 10%.

I'm also looking at the high-yield market. If you follow that, [? HYG ?] is a ticker. That has not capitulated. So I think there's some room to go to the downside. And I've been saying all week, and so have many Wall Street strategists, that we are ripe for a bear market rally. You can punt those, but don't add money to this market thinking that we're going to get back to all-time highs.

- It sounds like more pain to come. All right, Jared. Thank you, my friend.",2022-05-20T20:53:14+00:00

An investor who bought the 50 worst relative strength stocks from 1951 to 2003 would have turned $10,000 into only $79,266, according to data collected by fund manager Jim O’Shaughnessy. The same $10,000 in index funds would have grown to $5,743,706.

Today, the story remains the same. “Buying the dip” remains a losing game.

Of the 3,000 stocks in the broad-based Russell 3000 index, the lowest-performing quintile of stocks during H2 2021 has continued to lag this year. A chart showing the year-to-date performance of stocks in the Russell 3000 index. Stocks are grouped into 5 quintiles based on performance in the second half of 2021, and the lowest quintile has the worst performance year-to-date.

Lowest-momentum stocks have performed the worst in 2022 so far.

Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule.

Companies like NexTier Oilfield Solutions (NYSE:NEX) turned a -30% loss in H2 2021 into a 191% gain.

And history is filled with downturns that gave investors a second chance to buy high-quality stocks.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 1997… Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2002… Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in 2008… Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in 2018…

The list goes on and on.

How to Buy the Dip?

So how should investors find today’s Amazon and NexTier comeback stories while avoiding flops like Pets.com?

The answer is surprisingly straightforward. Successful buy-the-dip firms generally have at least one of these features:

Outside Saviors. Some firms like GameStop (NYSE:GME) find white knights like Chewy founder Ryan Cohen. These activist investors scoop up shares with the intention of saving businesses from certain death. Internal Assets. Others, such as Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), recover thanks to asset values. These companies tend to have tangible assets that can be traded or converted to cash as needed. Strong Cash Flows. Finally, some firms can generate cash regardless of market conditions. Companies like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) saw shares rise during the 2008 financial crisis as consumers shifted to cheaper options.

Occasionally, some companies will check multiple boxes. My top penny stock pick of 2021 Hertz (NASDAQ:HTZ) emerged from bankruptcy when 1) white knight investors believed the firm’s 2) billion-dollar automobile fleet and 3) anticipated post-Covid-19 cash flows were worth more than bankruptcy courts gave the company credit for.

Once you find companies with these features, it’s often worthwhile to back up the truck.

For Profit…

Of the three categories, “Outside Saviors” is perhaps the most rewarding — if paired with another catalyst. Relying on a single person like Elon Musk or Softbank’s Masayoshi Son for a bailout is otherwise too risky.

Fortunately, I have good news:

“Internal Assets” companies are now everywhere.

Today, no fewer than 373 billion-dollar companies trade at negative enterprise value. An enterprising (and deep-pocketed) investor could theoretically take any of these firms private and end up with more assets than they started with. High-growth firms like Rhythm Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RYTM) and Singular Genomics (NASDAQ:OMIC) make attractive takeover targets.

And that brings me to Desktop Metal (NYSE:DM) — a firm I’ve already written about at length.

In prior notes, I’ve commented that this 3D printing firm is on the leading edge of an American manufacturing revolution. Its ability to print metal products at high speeds makes it competitive with casting — a labor-intensive process that has stymied many American manufacturers.

Today, I’m adding DM to the top of my list of “buy-the-dip” plays. The 3D printing firm now trades close to its tangible book value, making it a potential buyout target. And though the firm still has a 25% to 35% chance of going bankrupt over its weak cash flow, its valuable intellectual property (IP) and strong sales team give it a reasonable chance of surviving any potential crisis to become a 10x stock. A chart showing share price vs. tangible book value for DM stock over time.

Meanwhile, “Strong Cash Flows” companies are also on blue-light special.

This week, I’m introducing Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) as a “buy-the-dip” play thanks to its wide-moat business and strong cash flows.

Since 2017, the ecommerce site has generated a steady stream of profits thanks to its focus on unique, non-commoditized goods. The company generated $620 million in free cash flow in 2021, which it used on value-added acquisitions.

Etsy is also shrugging off the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. Analysts expect the ecommerce firm to grow revenues another 60% by 2024, compared to a -5% decline for fellow work-from-home darling ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH).

The recent tech selloff has also moved prices to reasonable levels. Etsy now trades at a 16x forward price-to-cashflow multiple (P/CF), a figure comparable to Amazon’s 18x ratio and far lower than Shopify’s (NYSE:SHOP) >500x. A chart showing share price vs. cash flow per share of ETSY stock over time.

Investors, however, should still exercise restraint with position sizing.  If the U.S. economy swings into an unexpectedly deep recession, share prices could theoretically drop below $50 — a 12x P/CF ratio. And Etsy’s current $10 billion market capitalization means it needs to drop 20% to 30% for any would-be acquirer to swallow.

Still, Etsy remains my top “buy-the-dip” ecommerce firm for its ability to generate strong cash flows and the potential for a buyout offer should prices continue to fall.

…And for Protection

Investors seeking stronger protection than Desktop Metal or Etsy should turn to history. As mentioned on Tuesday, Consumer Staples tend to outperform during recessions. A chart showing the annualized relative performance of sectors during recession cycles.

And that brings me to HanesBrands (NYSE:HBI), an innerwear firm that has averaged double-digit return on invested capital (ROIC) for the past two decades.

In many ways, HBI looks like a Perpetual Money Machine — abnormally high ROIC and a wide-moat business that does well regardless of recessions or fashion trends.

Even when the economy is falling apart, people still need underwear.

HanesBrands also has a hard-to-beat cost advantage. The firm owns Hanes, Champion and Bonds, giving the parent firm a 32% market share of the North American market and 21% of the Australian one.

The firm also produces 70% of its products in-house, giving it slightly better control over costs in its supply chain.

Today, investors can scoop up HanesBrands for under 8x forward price-to-earnings. Competitors Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Gildan Activewear (NYSE:GIL) trade for 41% and 30% premiums, respectively. A chart showing share price vs. forward EPS for HBI stock.

That said, HBI will face some issues along the way. Shipping delays, rising commodity prices and retail store closures will eat into profits; Wall Street analysts have already cut earnings estimates by 9.3%.

HanesBrands also fails one of the Perpetual Money Machine requirements — the ability to reinvest its high ROIC back into the business. The innerwear business is a mature, zero-growth industry, while activewear is cutthroat and competitive. HBI will have trouble doing much with its expected 20% ROIC besides issuing a steady dividend.

Yet, the longer-term matters far less for those looking to ride out the next 6 to 12 months. When worldwide stock markets are falling apart, HBI offers a combination of strong cash flows and low prices that are hard to beat.

Bottom line: HBI offers the lowest-risk “buy-the-dip” investment, followed by ETSY. DM is the highest risk of the three for its shaky financials, but offers the best potential returns.

The Value of Quant Investing

When I first started trading in my early 20s, I followed the same advice virtually every novice Wall Streeter heeds:

“Buy the dip.”

The old quip has been touted by everyone from Nathan Rothschild to Warren Buffett as a responsible way to invest in stocks.

Yet the data tells a different story.

As a group, lagging stocks tend to keep crashing. Low share prices can make it harder to raise capital, creating a “death spiral” of worsening growth and even lower stock prices. Social messaging boards are filled with stories of people jumping into loss makers like GameStop and getting served another helping of declines.

But a quant-based approach can help us avoid these duds.

By removing the worst cash-flow companies from the lowest momentum quintile of H2 2021 stocks (i.e., all companies earning less than 10% cash-flow-to-sales), returns improve from -38% to -17.6%. Cutting firms with high valuations of >10x EV/CFO from that group further increases returns to a positive 1.1%. A chart showing how removing low CF and expensive stocks raises the YTD return of 2021's underperforming stocks.

These insights can help investors gain handsomely. Once markets finally bottom out, these top “buy-the-dip” stocks quickly become the gas that powers portfolios to recovery.

758,"ESG movement ‘weaponized by phony social justice warriors,’ Musk says as Tesla stock dips more than 6% Friday","The world’s most recognizable and profitable electric vehicle maker lost some of its luster after the S&P 500 booted the company from its ESG list this week.

Tesla owner Elon Musk was furious, labeling the entire notion of ESG—which judges corporations’ performance based on environmental, social, and governance metrics—a “scam” on Twitter. The ESG movement had been “weaponized by phony social justice warriors,” he added.

Musk’s gripe with the S&P 500 was that it was unreasonable that Tesla, which held 14% of the EV market share last year, would be removed from the list “despite Tesla doing more for the environment than any company ever!,” while oil companies including ExxonMobil are permitted to remain.

But while Tesla may have played a pivotal role in kick-starting the electric car revolution and game-changing developments in battery storage technology, the company’s decline on the S&P 500’s ESG list appears to have happened for other reasons.

Tesla’s ESG drop

“While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,” Margaret Dorn, head of ESG Indices for North America, wrote in a Tuesday blog post.

Dorn identified two separate issues that impacted Tesla’s lower ESG score: complaints of racial discrimination and poor working conditions in Tesla factories, and the company’s response to a regulatory investigation into multiple deaths and injuries that had been linked to Tesla’s self-driving vehicles.

“Both of these events had a negative impact on the company’s S&P DJI ESG Score at the criteria level, and subsequently its overall score,” Dorn wrote.

The divergence in how Musk and S&P 500 view ESG criteria is representative of an industry that is still painfully subject to individual interpretation, and trying to figure itself out.

What does ESG even mean?

Investment firms use ESG ratings to guide them in classifying different stocks as suitable for a more sustainable investing portfolio. But the fuzzy rules of the new investment trend has led to confusion over how the system works, and many portfolios immediately liken a company stamped with a good ESG rating as a promising target for sustainable investing.

Story continues

The ESG movement has been booming in recent years. ESG assets surpassed $35 trillion worldwide in 2020, a jump from $30.6 trillion in 2018. The industry could be worth as much as $53 trillion by 2025, a third of all projected assets under management by then.

The fervent interest in ESG has pushed many companies to adopt its principles, out of fear that their stock would suffer if they don’t. But the frenzy of ESG investing has also come with a good amount of confusion over who sets the rules, and what its principles actually are.

Several of the oil companies on the current ESG Index list, including ExxonMobil, are there by virtue of their commitments to improving their ESG ratings and initiatives to go carbon neutral, despite recent regulatory probes as to whether the company lied to investors and the public with regards to how much it knew about its activities impact on climate change.

In an interview this week with Reuters, chief investment officer at Toscafund Hong Kong, Mark Tinker, said that Musk was right in saying that ESG principles could be easily retooled and interpreted, and also that a company’s commitment to help the environment can “mean what you want to.”

“The whole thing is very subjective,” Tinker said.

In February, ESG expert and author Michael Baxter made an interesting analogy for Tesla’s already declining ESG score: figure skating.

Baxter wrote that like in skating, judges can give high rewards for certain accomplishments, such as creating a product that helps reduce fossil fuels in circulation, as Tesla has done. But in other areas, Musk and his company have been less successful.

“Within the very specific category called ‘developing a product that helps beat climate change,’  Tesla scores top marks—plus three,” Baxter wrote. “But for transparency, labor relations, adherence to governance, for example, having a CEO who doesn’t send out random tweets, Tesla scores poorly.”

Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are all deep in correction territory.

But Goldman Sachs still sees plenty of opportunities. In fact, the Wall Street firm has issued 'buy' ratings on multiple companies this year, projecting meaningful upside ahead.

So here’s a look at four stocks Goldman Sachs is bullish on. These are volatile names, though, so always do your own research before making investment decisions.

Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.

Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla has been a favorite among investors. And it’s not hard to see why: shares of the electric car giant have returned a jaw-dropping 992% over the past five years.

While that means long-term investors are laughing all the way to the bank, it’s important to remember that big swings can happen in both directions.

Tesla shares are already down about 41% in 2022.

Still, Goldman is quite bullish on the company. In January, one of its analysts Mark Delaney named Tesla a top pick for 2022. He reiterated a buy rating on the company and raised his price target to $1,200.

Considering that Tesla shares trade at around $709 apiece at the moment, the price target implies upside potential of 69%. “We believe that Tesla, given its leadership position in EVs, and its focus on clean transportation more broadly will be best positioned to capitalize on the long-term shift to EVs,” Delaney wrote in a note to investors.

He’s also optimistic about the company’s improving profitability and production figures.

In Q1, Tesla delivered 310,048 EVs, marking a new record.

“We expect Tesla to expand margins in the intermediate term as it ramps the important Model Y product as well as new factories in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, and in the long-term as it increases its mix of software revenue,” the analyst added.

Snowflake (SNOW)

Many consider big data to be the next big thing. And that’s where Snowflake found its opportunity.

Story continues

The cloud-based data warehousing company, founded in 2012, serves thousands of customers across a wide range of industries, including 241 of the Fortune 500.

While Snowflake shares are down a painful 57% in 2022, the company still commands a market cap of over $45 billion.

In the three months ended Jan. 31, revenue surged 102% year over year to $359.6 million. Notably, net revenue retention rate was a solid 178%.

The company continued to score large customer wins. It now has 184 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue of more than $1 million, compared to 77 such customers a year ago.

Goldman Sachs recently lowered the price target on Snowflake shares to $289 but maintained its buy rating for the company.

Since Snowflake currently trades at around $143.50 apiece, the price target implies a potential upside of 101%.

Match Group (MTCH) and Bumble (BMBL)

The stay-at-home environment caused by the pandemic has fueled the growth at several online dating companies. But that doesn’t mean they’re market darlings at the moment.

Shares of Match Group — which has a portfolio of brands including Tinder, Match, and Hinge — are down 45% over the past 12 months. Bumble — the parent company of Bumble and Badoo apps — has fallen over 60% since the stock started trading last February.

But Goldman Sachs expects a rebound in these two names.

“Match Group & Bumble have underperformed the S&P 500 in '21 and we see the current valuation as an attractive entry point into a multi-year compounded growth story,” wrote analyst Alexandra Steiger in January.

Steiger upgraded both companies from neutral to buy.

She set a price target of $157 on Match, which was later lowered to $152 – still 95% higher than where the stock sits today. For Bumble, Steiger lowered her price target to $42 in March, implying upside of more than 46%.

Both companies have been delivering solid growth figures. In Q1 of 2022, Match Group’s revenue increased 20% while Bumble’s revenue rose 24%.

When Nio (NYSE:NIO) announced its April 2022 deliveries update on May 1, investors weren’t impressed by the 28% decrease from a year ago and 49% drop from March. NIO stock ultimately fell from $18.13 on May 4 to a low of $12.71 on May 11.

However, thanks to Bank of America analyst Ming Hsun Lee’s May 16 upgrade of Nio to “Buy” from “Neutral,” combined with a one-dollar increase in its target price to $26, Nio’s stock is getting a few more nibbles from investors.

Up almost 19% in the past week, it appears as though the analyst is correct to suggest that the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s worst days are likely behind it. I would agree.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

I believe that the company’s product diversity has something to do with that bounce. For this reason, I, too, believe Nio’s share price has bottomed. It’s now a long-term buy.

NIO Nio $16.35

NIO Stock Hasn’t Been This Cheap Since 2019

One of Lee’s arguments for buying Nio at current prices is its valuation. Its enterprise value is currently 1.7x sales. Investors haven’t applied this low a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio since the back half of 2019 and the first part of 2020.

“NIO’s current operation is way better than it was in 2H19-1Q2020, and we expect its outlook to be brighter in terms of sales growth, margin recovery and overseas development,” MarketWatch reported Lee wrote in a note to clients. “In our view, the current valuation is attractive for investors to revisit the stock.”

Let’s consider the valuation of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the number one producer of EVs worldwide. It has an enterprise value of $739.5 billion and trailing 12-month sales of $62.2 billion. That’s an enterprise value-to-sales (EV/S) of 11.9x, 7x Nio’s forward EV/S multiple.

Story continues

Suppose you use Tesla’s 2023 sales estimate of $116.2 billion, the EV/S multiple drops to 6.4. However, if you apply Nio’s 2023 sales estimate of $15.8 billion, its EV/S multiple falls to 1.2, or one-fifth Tesla’s valuation.

That seems out of whack, given Nio’s already delivering four vehicle models to customers with more on the way.

Nio’s Product Diversity Matches Tesla

What stood out for me in Nio’s Covid-affected April deliveries update is that it delivered 693 ET7s, the company’s fourth vehicle to roll off the Hefei factory floor. That’s a 325% increase over the 163 ET7s delivered in March, its first month available to customers.

Nio may deliver 1,000 vehicles for each of its four EVs in May. While those aren’t Tesla numbers, they’re pretty darn good for a company struggling to keep the lights on as recently as April 2020.

How many EVs does Tesla have? It also has four: Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y. Tesla launched its first vehicle in 2012, a decade ago. Nio launched its first vehicle (ES8) in December 2017. So, it took a little over four years to have an equal number of products to sell to potential customers.

And now, it plans to start production of its mass-market sub-brand in 2024. So if Tesla doesn’t watch out, Nio will glide on by.

Yes, NIO Stock is a Long-Term Buy

If you bought NIO stock at or near its May 12 52-week low of $11.57, I would commend you for your wise move. It hasn’t been this low since July 2020. However, it’s delivered a lot of vehicles in the interim.

As the BofA analyst stated, the company’s sales and margins are looking up, yet investors value it like it’s never delivered a vehicle before. I hate to break it to you; it will officially go over 200,000 cumulative deliveries in its history once it announces May numbers in two weeks.

If you’re an aggressive investor, even at $16.50, NIO stock is an excellent long-term buy.

On Saturday, Musk agreed with a suggestion from conservative writer Ian Miles Cheong that the Tesla CEO should lower his price for Twitter by the proportion of bots on the platform, or, for example, asking for a 25% discount if 25% of Twitter users were fake.

Musk’s $44 billion deal for Twitter has the Tesla CEO paying $54.20 per share, a 42% premium over Twitter’s Friday share price of $38.29. Knocking the deal price down by 25% would mean paying $40.65 per share, only a slight 6% premium over the current share price.

Musk has long been irritated by fake accounts on Twitter, pledging to kick spam bots off the platform in the event that his takeover bid goes through. Since declaring that his attempt to buy Twitter was “on hold” on May 13, Musk has repeatedly challenged Twitter’s claim that spam bots only make up 5% of the platform's users. The Tesla CEO has claimed that the number of fake accounts could be closer to 20%, or even as high as 80%.

On Saturday, Musk tweeted he was worried that ""Twitter has a disincentive to reduce spam, as it reduces perceived daily users.” Musk alleged that the social media platform was refusing to explain how it calculated the number of bot users, calling it “very suspicious.”

When Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tried to explain how the company calculates the number of spam accounts last week, Musk responded with a poop emoji.

Musk may have other reasons for wanting to renegotiate his deal with Twitter, however. The broad slump in tech stocks may be encouraging the Tesla CEO to reassess the value of the social media platform. Twitter shares are down 26% since April 25, the day Musk agreed to buy Twitter.

Musk's wealth has also diminished due to the plunge in Tesla shares, which are down 33% since April 25, as investors worry about the Tesla CEO's ability to manage the electric carmaker along with Twitter, SpaceX, and his other initiatives. (Musk has pushed back against these concerns, claiming to be spending less than 5% of his time on the Twitter acquisition.)

For its part, Twitter says the deal, as originally agreed, is going ahead. Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s chief lawyer, told an all-hands meeting on Friday that the deal with Musk is not “on hold”—despite Musk’s statements on Twitter—and that the sale would proceed at the agreed-upon price of $54.20 per share, reports Bloomberg.

777,Explainer-Do claims against Musk raise a legal issue for his companies and Twitter deal?,"By Daniel Wiessner and Tom Hals

(Reuters) - A report saying Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk's company SpaceX paid $250,000 to settle sexual harassment claims by a flight attendant on a private jet comes as he eyes a takeover of Twitter.

Below is an overview of some of the key legal questions arising from the claims, which were published on Thursday by Business Insider. Musk has denied the allegations.

WHAT ARE THE CLAIMS AGAINST MUSK?

Business Insider reported on Thursday that SpaceX paid $250,000 in 2018 to settle claims by an unnamed private jet flight attendant who accused Musk of exposing himself to her. The article quoted an anonymous person who said she was a friend of the flight attendant. The friend had provided a statement as part of a private settlement process, according to the article.

In Twitter posts on Thursday, Musk called the allegations ""utterly untrue"" and said the alleged exposure ""never happened."" Reuters could not independently confirm the Business Insider report.

HAS MUSK FACED ANY PAST SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS OR LAWSUITS?

No. There are no other public harassment allegations against Musk.

ARE MUSK'S COMPANIES FACING SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR OTHER EMPLOYMENT LAWSUITS?

Tesla has faced accusations of race and sex discrimination, including a race bias class action lawsuit in California state court and a lawsuit by California's Department of Fair Housing and Employment, which alleges widespread race discrimination.

At least seven women have filed sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuits against Tesla since late last year. These lawsuits are at an early stage.

Tesla has broadly denied wrongdoing and said it has adopted policies to prevent and punish workplace misconduct.

Tesla is hardly unique in facing such legal challenges; most U.S. companies with large workforces face some employment-related claims and lawsuits.

SpaceX is not facing lawsuits over sexual harassment, despite several accusations that female employees have made in the media and online. In December, for instance, a former SpaceX engineer wrote in a blog post that the company was ""rife with sexism"" and that her complaints of sexual harassment had been ignored.

Story continues

SpaceX has said it rigorously investigates harassment and discrimination complaints and takes appropriate action when a company policy is violated.

IS MUSK A DEFENDANT IN THE LAWSUITS AGAINST THE COMPANIES?

No. Musk is not a defendant in any of the lawsuits. But, in several pending race discrimination and sexual harassment cases employees have accused him and other senior company leaders of being dismissive about misconduct and of allowing hostile workplace conditions to fester.

WHERE DO THE LAWSUITS STAND AND HOW HAVE THE COMPANIES RESPONDED TO THEM?

A federal judge in April awarded $15 million to a Black Tesla factory worker who claimed he was subjected to racial slurs and racist graffiti by coworkers at a Fremont, California, factory. Tesla has sought to pause the California agency's lawsuit, claiming it failed to conduct a proper investigation before suing.

A California judge is expected to rule soon on Tesla's motion to send one of the sexual harassment lawsuits against Tesla to arbitration. The judge is presiding over five similar cases, so his ruling could also affect those lawsuits.

IF MUSK DID SETTLE WITH THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT, WOULD HE HAVE HAD A DUTY TO DISCLOSE IT TO SPACEX'S BOARD?

Boards have a duty to ensure that companies comply with the law, including laws that prohibit sex discrimination. While board members aren't expected to know about every single allegation of rule-breaking, ""they'd be expected to have procedures to know claims of lawbreaking directly against the CEO,"" said Ann Lipton of Tulane Law School.

Reuters was unable independently to determine the source of any funds used to compensate the alleged victim in the SpaceX case.

WOULD TESLA'S BOARD KNOW OF THE SETTLEMENT?

Three 2016 SpaceX board members also served simultaneously on the board of Tesla. But they have a duty of confidentiality for information obtained as a director, so they may not have shared the information with the Tesla board. Reuters was unable to ascertain whether these board members disclosed the settlement.

DOES TWITTER HAVE A REASON TO INVESTIGATE?

The answer is ""a clear 'no,'"" Lipton said. Musk is a large Twitter shareholder and has sought to buy the company, but when a board is selling a company for cash, its ""only responsibility is to get the highest price for shareholders,"" she said.

778,4 Battery Stocks to Buy and Hold for Massive Gains,"These battery stocks could create shareholder value thanks to growth in the electric vehicle (EV) market. FREYR Battery (FREY) — Agreements with large energy companies are likely to provide a growth roadway ahead. Panasonic (PCRFY) — A new facility in Japan dedicated to the production of EV lithium-ion batteries should speed up production and increase revenue. QuantumScape (QS) — A new research and development center in Kyoto will open a new market of customers in the Asia-Pacific region. Romeo Power (RMO) — A recent agreement to provide lithium-ion batteries for a new line of low-speed EVs could mean enhanced revenue. 4 Battery Stocks Price Chart

Battery stocks, our topic for today, have had a rough year so far. Fears of an economic downturn have added to the woes of an industry plagued by persistent supply chain issues.

Yet, in the long-run, the outlook remains bright for companies in the growing electric vehicle space. Recent research highlights, “Between 2020 and 2026, the size of the global electric vehicle market is expected to increase over four-fold to reach an estimated market size of some one trillion U.S. dollars by 2026.” Such an increase would mean a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 23%.

High inflation and expected interest rate hikes have made investors wary of putting names in high-growth names that may not yet be profitable. Since the beginning of 2022, the S&P Kensho Electric Vehiclesindex has fallen 33.5%. During the same period, the Global X Lithium & Battery TechETF (NASDAQ:LIT) has dropped 15.4%.

7 REITs to Buy for the Second Half of 2022

Despite recent losses, many analysts concur that electric vehicles are the future of transportation. Therefore, manufacturers of key components for these cars are likely to soar as consumers switch to all-electric in the face of climate concerns as well as rising gas prices.

With that information, here are four battery stocks to buy in the coming months:

The first stock on today’s list, FREYR Battery (NYSE:FREY), comes from Norway. It design low-cost lithium-ion batteries for a variety of applications. It is building a facility in Norway, slated to begin production of lithium-ion batteries later this year.

Earlier this month, this pre-revenue company reported first-quarter financials. Net loss was $34.9 million, compared to a net loss of $28 million the previous quarter. Loss per share was 30 cents, compared to 24 cents in Q4 FY21. Cash and equivalents totaled $524.6 million.

Recently, the company announced an offtake agreement with Powin, an Oregon energy-storage solutions provider. FREYR has agreed to supply Powin with 28.5 GWh of battery cells from 2024 to 2030. This transaction represents the latest in a series of offtake agreements with other companies, including SiemensEnergy (OTCMKTS:SMNEY), AP Moeller – Maersk (OTCMKTS:AMKBY), and HoneywellInternational (NASDAQ:HON).

FREY stock is down 32.8% year-to-date. The 12-month median forecast stands at $18 a share. FREY Battery’s market capitalization is currently shy of $1 billion.

Panasonic (PCRFY) 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality

Next up on our list is the consumer electronics giant Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY). The Japanese group is also the world’s third-largest producer of EV batteries. It has partnerships with Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to produce batteries for their EVs.

In early May, Panasonic released FY22 financials. Net sales were 7.39 trillion yen ($57.81 billion), up 100% year-over-year. Net profit attributable to shareholders also went up by 155%.

Investors paid close attention to the Energy segment, where sales increased by 27% to 764.4 billion yen from a year ago. This is due to increased sales of automotive batteries and power storage systems with significant growing demand for EVs globally as well as growing demand for Internet-of-Things (IoT) and social infrastructure use.

7 Dividend Stocks to Boost Your Retirement Savings

In fiscal 2023, management expects strong revenue, thanks to recovery in the automobile and aviation industries as well as growing demand for automotive batteries, according to a statement.

Panasonic recently announced construction plans for a new lithium-ion battery production facility in Japan. Production should begin in March of 2024.

Despite the positive outlook, PCRFY stock has lost about 19.6% since January. The current price supports a dividend yield is 2.21%. Shares are trading at 10.76 times forward earnings and 0.37 times trailing sales. Finally, the 12-month median forecast stands at $11.44.

Our third battery stock pick is QuantumScape (NYSE:QS). This pre-revenue group focuses on solid-state EV batteries. It is working on developing a fast-charging, anode-less EV battery, capable of recharging up to 80% in 15 minutes.

In late April, QuantumScape issued Q1 metrics. GAAP net loss totaled $90.4 million, compared to $75 million the year before. Diluted loss per share was 21 cents. The year before, diluted loss per share was 20 cents.

Management recently announced a new office and research laboratory in Kyoto, Japan. This stepping stone into the Asia-Pacific market could help QuantumScape take advantage of the already thriving battery industry in Asia. Meanwhile, investors stateside are more than ready to see commercial production and revenues before too long.

In November 2021, QS stock hit a record high of $43.08. But the past six months, we have seen a different story and it is down 44.3% YTD. At present, the 12-month median forecast stands at $19. The market cap for QuantumScape is $5.21 billion.

The final battery stock for today is Romeo Power (NYSE:RMO). It designs modular batteries for a variety of EV applications, ranging from delivery vans to long-haul trucks.

In early May, Romeo Power released Q1 financials. Revenue was $11.6 million, compared to $1.1 million the year before. Diluted loss per share was 60 cents.

Recently, the company announced it’s become the sole provider of lithium-ion batteries for an undisclosed manufacturer’s new line of next generation low-speed electric vehicles (LSEVs). According to Romeo, their batteries were chosen specifically to meet the high-reliability requirements of the customer.

It’s not just the technology stocks that have been battered and bruised in the recent market correction. The decline has been broad-based. Auto stocks have also faced the heat with a deep correction in some high-flying growth stocks. In particular, from the electric vehicle segment. Overall, the S&P 500 Automobiles & Components Index has declined by 34% so far this year.

With a meaningful correction, it’s time for some cherry-picking. There seem to be several oversold auto stocks that can be long-term value creators. I would gradually accumulate some quality names in the next few months.

It’s worth noting that the industry is facing challenges related to raw material inflation. Supply chain issues have also impacted sentiments. Additionally, auto stocks seem to be discounting a potential slowdown or recession in the next few quarters.

7 REITs to Buy for the Second Half of 2022

Even with these headwinds in consideration, there are auto stocks that seem to have over-reacted on the downside. Let’s discuss five oversold auto stocks that are worth considering for the medium to long term.

Story continues

Ticker Company Current Price XPEV XPeng Inc. $23.27 RIVN Rivian Automotive, Inc. $28.92 F Ford Motor Company $12.50 TSLA Tesla, Inc. $663.90 GM General Motors Company $35.40

Chinese electric vehicle stocks have faced multiple near-term headwinds. This includes chip shortage, raw material inflation and surge in Covid cases in China. Listing uncertainties in the U.S. exchange also added to the worries.

It’s not surprising that XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) stock has plunged by 53% so far this year. The stock looks attractive after a deep correction.

For Q1 2022, XPeng reported 159% increase in vehicle deliveries on a year-on-year basis to 34,561. While vehicle deliveries have been impacted in April 2022 due to a surge in Covid cases, the outlook beyond this headwind is positive.

In Q3 2022, the company’s SUV G9 is scheduled for mass-deliveries. This is likely to boost growth through 2023. The company is also aggressively expanding into Europe and that’s another reason to be bullish.

As of 2021, XPeng also reported cash and equivalents of $6.8 billion. There is ample financial flexibility for manufacturing expansion investments and product development. The near-term headwinds therefore present a good buying opportunity in XPEV stock.

From highs of $179.50 in November 2022, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock has plunged to current levels of nearly $29. I believe that it’s among the top oversold auto stocks to buy.

The company’s R1 model already has 90,000 pre-orders from the U.S. and Canada. Further, the electric delivery van order from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides revenue visibility.

Rivian has also planned capacity ramp-up to 600,000 vehicles between Normal and Georgia plants. With $17 billion in cash and equivalents, there is ample flexibility for investment in the next 24 months.

For Q1 2022, Rivian produced and delivered 2,553 and 1,227 vehicles respectively. The company has also guided for annual production of 25,000 vehicles. While cash burn is likely to sustain, RIVN stock will trend higher if the order backlog continues to swell.

In the next few years, international expansion is also a key growth catalyst. It’s likely that demand for electric delivery vans will accelerate in Europe. The region is looking to reduce energy dependence on Russia.

Ford (NYSE:F) stock has also witnessed a sharp correction by nearly 40% in 2022. The stock currently trades at a forward price-earnings-ratio of 6.6. Clearly, the 2.3% dividend yield stock is among the oversold auto stocks to buy.

A big reason to like Ford is the company’s aggressive portfolio transformation towards electric vehicles. The company expects to have EV capacity of 600,000 by the end of 2023.

Ford has also signed a non-binding MOU with SK On and Koç Holding to create one of Europe’s commercial vehicle battery production sites in Turkey. Additionally, the company has also secured 25,000 tons of lithium resources annually from Lake Resources (OTCMKTS:LLKKF). The stage therefore seems set for strong growth in the EV segment.

From a financial perspective, Ford reported a total liquidity buffer of $44.6 billion as of Q1 2022. With the recent stake sale in Rivian, the liquidity position will get a further boost. Therefore, there is ample financial flexibility to pursue EV transformation and growth in Americas, Europe and China.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also witnessed a deep correction from 52-week highs. With the stock trading less than $700 levels, it’s a good time to accumulate.

Even with supply chain related challenges, Tesla delivered 310,048 vehicles in Q1 2022. Deliveries are likely to be lower in the current quarter with China struggling with the pandemic. However, the long-term outlook for deliveries growth remains robust.

Tesla is likely to commence mass delivery of Cybertruck and Roadster in 2023. The company has also started taking online bookings for Tesla Semi. With a healthy lineup, the company is positioned for sustained growth.

For the first quarter, Tesla reported operating cash flow of $4 billion. The company has strong financial flexibility for investment in growth.

With factories in the United States, China and Europe, Tesla is also positioned for higher cash flows with operating leverage. In particular, once capacity is ramped-up in Europe. Overall, TSLA stock is poised for a reversal rally once near-term headwinds for the industry are navigated.

General Motors General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background

Among traditional automobile companies, General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock is worth considering after a year-to-date correction of 40%. GM stock trades at a forward P/E of 5.2 and clearly seems oversold.

General Motors has also been focused on ramping-up growth in the electric vehicle segment. In North America, the company expects to produce 400,000 EV in 2022 and 2023. Further, the company has guided for one million units of EV capacity by 2025.

With investments in the EV segment, General Motors plans to double revenue to $295 billion (mid-range) by 2030. This would imply steady top-line growth and cash flow upside in the next few years.

From a financial perspective, the company reported automotive segment liquidity of $32.9 billion as of March 2022. The company has also guided for adjusted free cash flow of $8 billion. With ample resources, General Motors is well positioned for sustained growth.

Overall, GM stock is among the top oversold auto stocks to consider. Once current headwinds are navigated, the stock can quickly double.

780,Tesla plans to ramp up to pre-lockdown output in Shanghai by Tues-memo,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc plans to restore production at its Shanghai plant to the level at which it had operated before the city's COVID-19 lockdown by Tuesday, a day later than its most recent recovery plan, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Tesla will more than double its daily output to 2,600 electric vehicles at its Shanghai plant from Tuesday, according to the memo detailing the plan. That compares to around 1,000 EVs produced on Monday, according to the memo, and would bring Tesla's weekly output to nearly 16,000 units, the memo showed.

Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bringing production back to pre-lockdown levels has been a challenge for Tesla at the Shanghai plant, known as Gigafactory 3, because of problems stemming from the city's strict controls imposed from March on the movement of people and goods to curb the spread of COVID-19 during a recent outbreak.

Just over two weeks ago, Tesla had planned to have returned to pre-lockdown production levels by May 16, but then delayed that target by a week, Reuters reported.

Among the challenges for Tesla - and other manufacturers around Shanghai - have been insufficient workers, shipping obstacles and restricted supplies of parts, including wire harnesses.

Tesla was able to resume partial production on April 19 under what Chinese officials describe as a ""closed-loop"" control to prevent the spread of the virus. Companies in Shanghai are only allowed to reopen if they can operate under such an arrangement, which requires workers to be isolated.

Shanghai reopened a small part of the world's longest subway system on Sunday after closing some lines for almost two months, as the city paved the way for a more complete lifting of its COVID-19 lockdown this week.

The city government is asking local authorities to speed up approvals of certificates needed by workers to return to factories from this week.

The Shanghai shutdown has been costly for Tesla. The automaker sold only 1,512 EVs in China in April, down from 65,754 the previous month.

Before the lockdown, Tesla had run three shifts at the Shanghai plant. The factory, which makes Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, reopened on April 19 after a 22-day closure, its longest since the site opened in late 2019.

Cathie Wood of ARK Investment Management is one of the most prominent growth investors on Wall Street. Her hedge fund holds stakes in prominent tech firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX). Wood is also a big believer in electric vehicle stocks. In April, her fund released research that projected the share price of EV maker Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), coincidentally also the top holding in the ARK portfolio, would reach $4,600 per share by 2026.

However, Wood has reduced her exposure to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in recent months, trimming the stake of ARK in the EV firm by 6%, 27%, 51%, and 18% in the last four quarters. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still the largest holding in the ARK equity portfolio, but it seems that Wood is shifting her focus to other EV stocks, some of which are discussed below. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which was the largest holding of the flagship ARK Innovation ETF for more than four years, has also lost that position recently.

Wood, during a monthly market webinar, conceded the pressure that her fund has been under in the past few months, claiming that worrisome data out of China and Europe pointed towards a “global recession”. The famed investor, who has doubled down on her growth bets during this period, also stressed that commodity prices were beginning to top out, pointing to the fall in prices of new and used cars as an example. The portfolio value of ARK Investment Management has fallen from $33 billion in December 2021 to $23 billion in March 2022.

EV Stocks to Buy According to Cathie Wood

10. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) makes and sells electric vehicles and clean energy equipment. Latest data shows that ARK owned over 1.5 million shares of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at the end of the first quarter of 2022 worth $1.7 billion, representing 7.17% of the portfolio. The company has been in the ARK portfolio since the first quarter of 2018. In the first three months of 2022, the fund decreased its stake in the EV company by around 18% compared to filings for the fourth quarter of 2021.

On May 19, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $1,000 from $1,400, citing reduced estimates and a lower multiple as some of the reasons behind the target cut.

At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 91 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $12.9 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 60 in the previous quarter worth $10.6 billion.

Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the stocks that elite investors are monitoring.

Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:

“Within the growth universe we target, emerging growth stocks – the category with the highest revenue growth rates – significantly underperformed the overall growth categories in 2021 after leading performance in 2020. The pull-through effect on digitization, online access across industries, and spending to modernize outdated corporate infrastructures accelerated trends in a highly compressed time frame. Much of that trend slackened in 2021 and shares of these companies, while showing good top-line growth, saw slowing appreciation from the blistering pace in the prior year. With that moderating growth, multiples decelerated from 2020 highs. Bucking the headwinds among our emerging growth names was Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) which saw continued sales momentum from their leadership positions in the key growth areas of electric vehicles.”

9. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38

Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a diversified technology company. Bidu has partnered with auto firm Geely for an EV startup named Jidu that raised over $400 million at a funding round earlier this year. Securities filings show that ARK owned 177,142 shares of Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) at the end of March 2022 worth $23 million, representing 0.09% of the portfolio.

On May 16, JPMorgan analyst Alex Yao upgraded Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock to Neutral from Underweight and raised the price target to $125 from $90, appreciating the recent regulatory announcements from China that had abated some uncertainties around Baidu.

At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, 38 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.4 billion in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), compared to 44 in the preceding quarter worth $2 billion.

In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Ariel Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“When we have such a high level of conviction for a company it is not uncommon for us to own it in size across our portfolios. Such is the case with technology giant Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), whose leading search engine has been dubbed the “Google of China.” This quarter shares sold off in sympathy with the Chinese internet sector as investors were rattled by the government’s sweeping regulatory crackdown intended to promote “common prosperity” by easing wealth inequality. While we recognize the greater political risk of investing in emerging markets such as China and incorporate an appropriately higher risk premium in the discount rate in our valuation models, we believe Baidu’s business strategy is aligned with national policies and priorities and is therefore not adversely impacted unlike some other players in the internet sector who are in the eye of the storm.

Indeed, the Chinese government recognizes Baidu’s large, upfront investments in many next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and hails it as a national champion. For example, the company’s Advanced Driving Support System (ADAS), Apollo, has twice as much data on miles driven than any other initiative in the world, giving Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) (and China) a large lead in the global AI arms race. In addition, Baidu’s cloud offering touts highly differentiated Platform as a Service (PaaS) features and capabilities for a demanding enterprise customer base. While these initiatives are a temporary drag on margins and require long-term execution, their success will bolster China’s “dual circulation” strategy aimed at spurring domestic demand, innovation and self-reliance.” (Click here to see the full text)

791,U.N. official still hopes Musk will 'step up' to fight world hunger,"DAVOS, May 23 (Reuters) - David Beasley, the U.N. World Food Programme official who clashed with Elon Musk on Twitter last year, said on Monday he hadn't given up on the Tesla billionaire contributing to the fight against world hunger, though the two are not in direct contact.

In response to Beasley's challenge last year to the super wealthy to end global hunger, Musk said he would sell $6 billion of Tesla stock and donate it to the World Food Programme if the organisation gave more information about how it spent its money.

Beasley, who eventually quit the exchange after an unproductive back and forth, said at the World Economic Forum on Monday he was ready to meet Musk to detail his ideas, even if there is no direct contact between the two now.

""But there is some indirect contact through friends, relatives, representatives; there's a lot of wealthy people in the world who can step up, not just Elon,"" Beasley said on the sidelines of a panel discussion. ""But hopefully we'll still get him to step up.""

At his panel session, Beasley accused Russia of waging war on global food security by blockading Ukraine's ports, threatening millions with famine, mass migration and political instability.

With its ports essentially shut by Russia, Ukraine has struggled to export its vast grain supplies, deepening a global food crisis that risks destabilising parts of the world and has helped push inflation to multi-decade highs.

""Failure to open up the ports is a declaration of war on global food security,"" Beasley said. ""The breadbasket of the world now has the longest bread lines of the world.""

""Because of this crisis, we’re taking food from the hungry and giving it to the starving,"" he said.

Russia and Ukraine together account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies. Ukraine is also a major exporter of corn, barley, sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, while Russia and Belarus - which has backed Moscow in its war in Ukraine - account for more than 40% of global exports of potash, a crop nutrient.

Electric vehicle (EV) stocks are a great way to invest in the future of transportation. With new technology that is becoming increasingly popular, people can reduce their carbon footprint by frequently traveling without worrying about it.

There are not many companies that have made it big in the industry. As a result, there are not many stocks available for purchase yet. Hence, if you want to purchase electric vehicle stocks, you have a limited number of quality options.

Tesla (TSLA)

Story continues The Tesla (TSLA Stock) logo on the side of a building.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been around since 2003 and was founded by Elon Musk and Martin Eberhard. The company is better known for its innovative products and tech-related plans. It’s also known for excelling in design, speed, and efficiency. The company specializes in electric cars and electric vehicle components like lithium-ion batteries, power electronics, and high-performance supercapacitors for use in their vehicles.

Tesla’s first vehicle was the Roadster, which was released in 2008. It had a top speed of 245 mph and could go from 0-60 mph in four seconds. The company is known for its innovative designs and technology, such as its Autopilot self-driving capability, which came out in 2015.

When investors usually think of electric vehicle stocks, they think of TSLA. For them, the company is the preeminent stock in the EV sector. Therefore, they often do not look further than this one. But the thing to note is that the company is often considered overvalued. Undoubtedly, TSLA shares trade more on momentum than fundamentals. However, you cannot afford to ignore the automaker.

Tesla came out as the number one EV seller on the planet in 2021, with a 14.4% market share. The nearest competitor fell behind by almost a half; nobody else even came close. This little factoid alone will give you an idea of how dominant the company has been in terms of its industry.

When the discussion turns to Tesla, Nio (NYSE:NIO) can never be far behind. It is China’s version of Tesla and often generates significant interest in the U.S. due to its close association with a local Chinese government and significant sales growth.

However, in the year thus far, the company has lost some steam. You can blame several factors for this, the most prominent being the regulatory environment in China.

Automakers and startups are both taking a gamble on electric vehicles as they’re seen as a new but emerging industry. They’re also risky because of current market risk aversion and the scarcity of key components like batteries and computer chips.

The Chinese government is taking a tough stance regarding their red hot markets. While the sheer number of regulations has led to some concern with the overall balance of power between the state and the market, it is important to remember that this development was not just a random chance. The Xi Jinping administration wants to reign in the red hot markets.

Nio, however, wants to arrest its decline by introducing three new models this year based on the NIO Platform 2.0 (NP2) platform. The company is also expanding its partnership with the local government of Hefei in China’s central Anhui province. Considering how strict the regulatory environment is in this area, this partnership is invaluable to the company.

Ford (NYSE:F) is a company that has been around since 1903. It is the fourth-largest carmaker globally and a global force in the automotive industry.

Ford has been around for over 100 years and has always been one of the biggest companies in the automotive industry. Ford has always been ahead of its time when it comes to technology.

Usually, when investors think about EVs, they think about Tesla or any other pure-play electric vehicle stocks like Fisker (NYSE:FSR), Faraday Future Intelligent (NASDAQ:FFIE), or Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE).

However, Ford, in particular, has the brand and scale to compete with the new EV upstarts effectively. It has charted an aggressive path forward in EVs and autonomous vehicles (AVs).

In March, Ford Motor said it is increasing its spending on electric and hybrid cars to $50 billion, up from the previous $30 billion. This would go toward developing alternative fuel vehicles for the future at a time when gas is no longer cheap. By operating the fleet separately, they can focus on creating environmentally friendly cars and not have to worry about keeping prices low. It will go a long way in ensuring the company can catch up to major established EV companies like Tesla.

General Motors (NYSE:GM) was founded in 1908 by William Crapo Durant, who wanted to sell cars using installment payments. In 1918, he signed an agreement with Henry Ford to use his assembly line production methods for automobiles.

General Motors is one of the most recognizable brands in the world. They are one of the most innovative companies, with over 100 years of history. General Motors is also a pioneer in AI and robotics technology, having created an autonomous car with no steering wheel or pedals back in 2020.

The company will use the investment to develop technologies for autonomous driving and self-driving cars and advanced manufacturing processes and safety features like collision avoidance systems.

7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Investors Catch On

Last year, the company said it was investing $35 billion in autonomous and electric vehicles through 2025, boosting its commitment by 30% over the prior forecast. There are few companies investing this much in the space.

ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) is a business that provides electric car charging stations for businesses and individuals. The company has been around since 2007 and has seen tremendous growth in the last decade.

ChargePoint has grown its business by providing quality services to its customers at affordable rates. It has also been able to maintain its position as one of the leading providers of electric car charging stations in North America.

ChargePoint’s success can be attributed to its ability to provide value-added products, customer service, and reliable service delivery through a network of partners.

ChargePoint has over 109,800 places you can charge your car, the most interesting part is that you can charge any electric vehicle at all of them. Tesla’s chargers will only work with Tesla vehicles. So if you are looking for a pick-and-shovel play in the EV sector, then CHPT is an excellent investment.

Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is an electric car company seeing successin the highly competitive and crowded field. They offer a range of models with some of the best specs around.

Lucid Motors set the stage for the release of the “Lucid Air, Dream Edition” last November and received a lot of publicity from the press worldwide. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lucid’s Air has a range of 520 miles on a full battery. It beats all other electric cars on the market.

In addition, a new manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia will come with numerous benefits for Lucid Motors. This facility will give them the ability to enter new countries, grow their distribution needs, and help spread their manufacturing process worldwide.

The expansion into Saudi Arabia is an interesting move for Lucid. Other companies are focusing mainly on Europe and then China. But there’s potential to gain momentum in oil-rich Gulf countries as well. If a company manufactures high-end luxury electric cars, they are more likely to succeed in areas with a higher income. Therefore, Saudi Arabia is a great market.

QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) is a company that researches and manufactures solid-state lithium metal batteries for electric cars. Among its backers, you will find Bill Gates and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). Therefore, the company certainly has prominent supporters.

The quantum glass battery is a new, innovative idea that can have three times the energy of a lithium-ion battery and is not volatile or flammable. Consumers can use these batteries to charge their electric cars. And they don’t degrade over time.

The company CEO, Jagdeep Singh, revealed some positive results for the firm’s new solid-state battery and stated that it solves most of the problems surrounding this technology. He also said it would retain nearly 80% of its capacity after 800 cycles.

The thing to remember is that QuantumScape is still working on its technology. However, if it’s successful, the company can be a game-changer. Due to growth stocks’ weakness, shares are trading at very reasonable multiples versus their historical highs.

Greetings from the Motor City!

I took a couple of days off. What could possibly go wrong? Sure enough...

Today, let’s look at the latest turns in Elon Musk’s three-ring drama, size up Rivian’s delivery woes and break down Detroit’s latest strategy for powering up combustion SUV profits.

Here we go -

* Elon Musk’s Chaotic Twitterverse

The Techno-king of Tesla and the sometime-world’s richest person never takes a break.

On May 19, Musk tweeted that ""Tesla is on my mind 24/7 https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/tesla-investor-calls-share-buyback-after-musks-twitter-deal-hurts-stocks-2022-05-19 ” and accompanied that message with an image of a young man ogling a woman in a red dress while his girlfriend looks disgusted.

That same day, he denounced as ""utterly untrue"" https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-denies-he-sexually-harassed-flight-attendant-private-jet-2022-05-20 claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016. Again on Twitter, he made a ribald joke about the uproar https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1527525498460508160, declared he intended to vote Republican and then flew off to Sao Paolo to meet with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/elon-musk-meet-with-brazils-bolsonaro-says-report-2022-05-20.

Since Friday, Musk’s jet has traveled https://twitter.com/ElonJet to Brazil, Houston, Austin, Hawthorne, California and, as of this morning, was back in Austin, according to the Twitter account @elonjet https://twitter.com/ElonJet/status/1528487009144254464 which tracks the public records of the aircraft’s journeys.

During all this, Musk and his advisers continued their war with Twitter https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/do-claims-against-musk-raise-legal-issue-his-companies-twitter-deal-2022-05-23 over how much of the company’s traffic is generated by automated spam accounts.

Story continues

Musk has made clear his goal is to get a lower price for the social media company than the $44 billion he agreed to on April 25, when Tesla’s share price was about 33% higher than it was at today’s open. Twitter is just as adamant that the deal will go through at the agreed price.

Yes, what about Tesla? The world’s leading electric car company has lost 46% of its value from its 52-week high - shedding roughly $580 billion in market value.

S&P Global last week dropped Tesla from its ESG Index https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/tesla-removed-sp-500-esg-index-autopilot-discrimination-concerns-2022-05-18 - used by investment funds that want to put money into companies with superior scores on environment, social issues and corporate governance. S&P officials said Tesla’s scores had slipped on concerns https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/musks-esg-attack-spotlights-35-trillion-industry-confusion-2022-05-20 about its handling of claims of workplace racial discrimination and vehicle safety probes. Musk raged that ESG investing is a scam.

Also, out of the blue, Musk tweeted that Tesla is “building a hardcore litigation department” https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1527748229470646272 that will report to him, and “initiate & execute lawsuits.”

There was good news from China for Tesla shareholders today: The company is planning to restore production at its largest assembly plant to pre-pandemic levels by Tuesday, Reuters reported. https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-plans-ramp-up-pre-lockdown-output-shanghai-by-tues-memo-2022-05-23

The headlines about Tesla come with risks, especially for a company that has built its brand image https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-brand-threatened-by-musk-harassment-claim-criticism-democrats-2022-05-20 on environmentally progressive innovation. Ask Detroit’s automakers how difficult it can be to repair damage to a corporate reputation https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-recalls-39000-us-suvs-after-engine-fire-reports-2022-05-19.

* Can Rivian deliver?

Rivian is rebuilding its ordering and customer delivery system https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ev-maker-rivian-delivery-headache-hits-market-shuts-down-coffers-2022-05-23 to deal with its supply chain problems. That effort comes at some cost to customer satisfaction as people who ordered Rivian electric trucks and SUVs months ago see others behind them in line get vehicles while they wait.

Rivian’s struggle to match customer orders to what can be built with the parts available illustrates the pressure all of the post-Tesla crop of EV startups face. Investors have largely shut off the funding faucets, except at high prices. The costs of ramping to sustainable mass production are soaring. Investors and analysts agree that Rivian is one of the best of the EV companies to go public during the past two years. And yet its shares are down 72% since January.

* Detroit’s SUV Adventures

Someday, Ford aims to be a leading seller of electric vehicles https://s23.q4cdn.com/799033206/files/doc_presentations/2021/05/Delivering-Ford-Presentation.pdf. But right now, Ford is expanding its lineup of combustion-powered SUVs to cash in on consumer demand for vehicles outfitted for wilderness adventures somewhere west of Laramie https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/240458.

Ford is promoting new “Timberline” versions of its Expedition and Explorer SUVs https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/products/crossovers---suvs/expedition/2022-expedition.html. The Timberline Expeditions come with off-road ready hardware such as a “Trail Turn Assist” for negotiating tight corners between rocks, four-wheel drive systems with seven different drive modes and underbody armor borrowed from the Ford F-150 Raptor offroad pickup.

Ford managers say the target customers for the new Timberline models are Gen X’ers and Millennials. Wait! Weren’t Millennials going to be the generation that did not own cars? https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/new-study-millennials-prefer-car-access-over-ownership/32723 Never mind. Millennials now represent 28% of the customers buying large SUVs, said Ford Expedition brand manager Devin McParlane.

Not to be left out, Stellantis has two new large Jeep SUVs ramping up this year: The Wagoneer and the Grand Wagoneer.

General Motors has been less overt than its cross-town rivals about jumping on the off-road adventure bandwagon alongside Ford’s Bronco brand and the Jeep lineup. But the GMC Hummer EV with its crab-walking mode and insane Watts to Freedom (WTF) acceleration is a big step in that direction.

What’s behind all this Westward-ho marketing? Here’s a clue: An Expedition Timberline has a sticker price of just over $77,370, excluding freight. A regular Expedition starts at $52,620.

* America becomes Havana

The average sedan or compact car on the road in the United States is now 13.1 years old https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/average-age-us-cars-hits-record-high-due-tight-supplies-report-2022-05-23, a new record, according to S&P Global. Light trucks on the road are younger, but still hoary at an average age of 11.6 years. Overall, the U.S. car and light truck fleet is a record 12.2 years old, up from 10.9 years in 2011.

S&P Global said the supply chain crunch and resulting price spikes for used and new vehicles have led consumers to hang on to vehicles longer. The pandemic also pushed many people to ditch public transportation and rely on old vehicles instead.

S&P predicted a “notable increase in repair revenue” as drivers try to keep their clunkers on the road.

* Automakers become energy companies

BMW said it is exploring investments in solar, geothermal and hydrogen https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/bmw-exploring-energy-investments-reduce-dependence-natural-gas-2022-05-23 to replace natural gas as a source of energy for its operations. The company’s production chief said BMW has to diversify to blunt the risk that Russia will cut off natural gas supplies to Western Europe.

Tesla early on took the view that it was an energy company as well as an automaker. The Ukraine war and investor pressure to cut climate emissions are leading rivals to dig deeper into their own energy supply chains.

* Daimler Truck expands its battery drive

Daimler Truck said it will buy 9% of battery production equipment maker Manz. https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/daimler-truck-9-stake-germanys-105454256.html As part of the deal, Manz will build a pilot production system for batteries Daimler will use in electric trucks.

Why does it matter? Because in these times of scarcity, securing access to the sophisticated equipment needed to build EV batteries is just as critical as locking down supplies of lithium and other raw materials.

801,Tesla investor Streur says carmaker still believes in ESG,"By Ross Kerber

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk may have denounced business use of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors as a ""scam"" last week but one sustainable investing pioneer thinks the electric carmaker still believes in the cause.

John Streur, president of Calvert Research and Management, praised Tesla's disclosure of workforce diversity data earlier in May and said Tesla remains in his company's ESG indexes even though it was dropped out of the S&P 500 ESG Index last week, prompting Musk's fury.

""I think they've fully embraced operational excellence, which is really what ESG is all about,"" Streur said of Tesla in a recent interview.

Asked if Musk believes in ESG Streur said ""I can't speak for him, but I think his company does.""

Streur's take comes at a time when ESG investing faces criticism such as from conservatives who say questions like how to cut carbon emissions should be settled by government, not investors.

Calvert, a Morgan Stanley unit, holds what Streur called a ""full weight"" of Tesla in products like its Calvert US Large Cap Core Responsible Index Fund.

A twist for evaluating Musk's tweets is that several Tesla insiders also support ESG improvements including director Hiro Mizuno. ""Tesla is not denouncing ESG investments"" Mizuno on May 7. Instead, Mizuno and Tesla investor relations head Martin Viecha ESG ratings should focus on real-world impact.

Tesla, Viecha and Mizuno did not immediately comment.

Streur said he agrees ESG data ""can be a bit of a mess."" He praised the new diversity details that Tesla published this month after a majority of its investors in October backed a resolution Calvert had filed.

As Tesla grows, Streur said it will face more ESG risks to manage related to issues like mining and the location of facilities.

US stocks are recovering after closing in the red for the last seven consecutive weeks. Investors have factored in the recent volatility and are prepared to move forward as President Biden announced that he intends to lower tariffs on Chinese goods to benefit the local consumers and businesses. As of 11:01 AM ET, the S&P 500 Index, the Dow 30 Index, and the NASDAQ Composite Index are all up 1.08%, 1.54%, and 0.30%, respectively. Some popular stocks trending today include HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Car, Model S, Sign, Showroom, Brand, Logo, automotive, sales

Hadrian / Shutterstock.com Let’s look at why these stocks are trending today and discuss how hedge funds are positioned in them.

10. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is up 2.01% as of 12:03 PM ET after the Austin, Texas-based electric vehicle company revealed that it anticipates production from its Shanghai gigafactory to recover back to pre-pandemic levels. From tomorrow, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will see its daily production rise to 2,600 as opposed to the current level of 1,000 EVs. Previously, the largest automobile company in the world, in terms of market capitalization, was targeted to reach pre-lockdown levels of production by May 16. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw a drastic decline in Chinese monthly sales from 65,754 EVs in March 2022 to just 1,512 EVs in April 2022.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was featured in the Q3 2021 investor letter of Worm Capital LLC. Here’s what the investment management firm said:

“Our core portfolio as of this writing—TSLA, SPOT, SHOP, ABNB, and AMZN—are all premier examples of companies that use the concept of aggregation of marginal gains to continuously improve their value proposition for customers. After all, what is innovation if not just a continuous search for fractional advantages in business?

The way we see it, Tesla is perhaps the generational example of the marginal gain aggregation theory. It’s also been our largest position for several years now. There are many ways to characterize and value this business (see previous letters for longform write-ups), but perhaps the best way to think about the company is that it is a highly vertically-integrated software and hardware firm that’s devoted entirely to aggregating marginal gains across its organization. The goal? Lower costs, improve thruputs, and dramatically enhance the value proposition—at scale—for consumers…” (Click here to see the full text)

According to Insider Monkey’s proprietary data, 91 hedge funds held a position in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as of Q4 2021.

9. Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) is 2.57% in the red as of 10:55 AM ET after Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk placed more pressure on the San Francisco, California-based microblogging and social media company during the weekend. Musk claimed that Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) is not sharing information about the methodology behind the determination of fake accounts. The richest man on earth is looking to renegotiate the takeover deal at a lower price following the disclosure of spam accounts by Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR). Last month, Musk had agreed to buy Twitter for nearly $44 billion or $54 per share. However, the deal was put on hold after Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) disclosed that nearly 5% of all accounts on its platforms are fake.

ClearBridge Investments shared its opinion on Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Weakness among our holdings in the communication services sector was the other detractor to performance. Twitter shares sold off following weaker than expected third-quarter results, but under new leadership, we see the potential for improved execution and performance as live events and entertainment return to pre-pandemic levels.”

The number of hedge funds invested in Twitter, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWTR) stood at 83 as of December 31, 2021.

8. Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) is 1.94% in the green as of 10:56 AM ET following reports that the California-based electronic gaming and entertainment company is looking for a merger or a takeover by another company in the sector. Earlier, there were rumors that Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) was in negotiations with NBCUniversal, but the talks did not materialize. However, the company is now looking toward a diversified technology conglomerate like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), or the Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).

Wedgewood Partners shared its insights on Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Electronic Arts detracted from portfolio performance during the fourth quarter. We also sold out of our position in the stock and used the proceeds to add to existing holdings that are better positioned competitively. The Company’s core FIFA franchise continues to thrive; however, the risk to this franchise has begun to rise as licensors demand a larger share of EA’s economics. Further, the Company’s execution around another core franchise, “Battlefield,” disappointed us, despite several previous comments from management that promised better execution. Although the Company’s equity appears cheap compared to estimates for earnings over the next 12 months, the risk to its core franchises extends beyond that time frame and we decided to redeploy capital into companies with better competitive positioning.”

On a sequential basis, the number of funds invested in Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) decreased by 12 to 41 hedge funds in Q4 as compared to Q3.

7. GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) has risen 1.48% as of 12:08 PM ET after the Grapevine, Texas-based retailer of consumer electronics, gaming merchandise, and video games launched its digital wallet. This would allow gamers to send, receive and store various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The GameStop Wallet is an Ethereum wallet that will also allow transactions on GameStop Corp.’s (NYSE:GME) NFT marketplace, which is expected to be launched by the second half of this year.

Bronte Capital shared its stance on GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Gamestop is a retailer of video games on DVD ROM trying hard (and maybe with some success) to reinvent itself as an alternative computer game  distributor. The company raised enough money that bankruptcy is not an immediately likely outcome. (GME would have gone bankrupt except for the willingness of largely retail investors to provide them with much more cash.)

Both have bad financial results. Gamestop’s last financial results were terrible. And both stocks more than doubled very rapidly in March from market caps that were absurd to market caps that are more absurd. We are of course completely aware that they can double again and again after that. Their valuations are absurd but if you double the price they are not twice as absurd. They are just similarly disconnected from reality.

The reason we want to talk about them is that it is indicative of what is going on. Gamestop, the most meme of all stocks, announced a possible stock split and the stock, after market that day, traded up 17 percent. We could joke that every child knows that cutting a pizza into more slices yields more pizza. But in this market, not accepting that stock splits add value is a recipe for losing money.”

Out of the 924 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey, 14 funds held the widely popular meme stock of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) as of Q4 2021. D E Shaw had a stake worth over $122.3 million in GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) in Q1 2022.

6. VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) has risen 20.05% as of 10:58 AM ET following updates that the Palo Alto, California-based cloud computing company is an acquisition target for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). According to initial reports, both companies are still negotiating, and there is a possibility that the talks might not yield a positive outcome. Broadcom is valuing VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) at $50 billion. The deal is expected to close by Thursday, when VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) is scheduled to report its quarterly results. Back in 2017, Broadcom tried to acquire QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) for over $100 billion, but the deal fell apart after the Trump government blocked it for national security concerns.

In its Q3 2021 investor letter, VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) was discussed by ClearBridge Investments. Here’s what the investment management firm said:

“To make room for Netflix and better concentrate the Strategy in our highest-conviction names, we exited positions in software makers VMware. VMware, best known for its system visualization software, is in the earlier stages of an on-premise to cloud transition that could add volatility to growth and cash flow in coming years. At the same time, the company also recently announced several key leadership changes and will have higher financial leverage following the upcoming spinoff from Dell — expected in the fourth quarter.”

As of Q4 2021, VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW) was being held by 50 hedge funds.

In addition to VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW), some other trending stocks on Monday are HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

There are many strong, positive catalysts for renewable energy companies. Yet the stocks of these firms, in many cases, are selling for incredibly low valuations due to completely unfounded macro fears. As a result, investors can easily find plenty of radically undervalued renewable energy stocks.

The mainstream media is starting to mention a subject that I’ve discussed for years: the fact that the electrification of transportation will require the world to produce much more electricity. For example, Reuters recently noted that “Widespread EV adoption will spark a huge surge in [U.S.] power demand.”

Since solar energy is both clean and, in most places, the cheapest way to generate additional electricity, “huge” increases in power demand are going to result in huge volumes of solar modules being deployed.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Meanwhile, the European Union’s efforts to wean itself off of Russian gas is going to result in the bloc deploying very large numbers of solar modules, wind turbines and even hydrogen power plants.

Speaking of hydrogen, green hydrogen, which requires a great deal of renewable energy, is becoming all the rage in the E.U. and many other parts of the world .

The first of these undervalued renewable energy stocks is one of the largest solar module makers in the world, JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS). It is very well-positioned to benefit tremendously from the explosion of demand for solar panels in China, the E.U., the U.S., and many other places.

On Wall Street, there has been much hand wringing about the impact of a new investigation of solar imports from some East Asian countries aside from China. But during its last earnings conference call, JinkoSolar clarified that the increase in the demand for its solar panels from Europe and China looks well-positioned to make up for any reduction in U.S. demand spurred by the probe. And the company already has a U.S. factory whose business will boom as a result of the investigation.

Additionally, as a result of a recent initial public offering (IPO) of its main operating subsidiary in China, JinkoSolar’s debt has dropped tremendously, and the owners of JKS stock are benefiting from dividends that the company is receiving from its subsidiary.

The shares are changing hands for little more than 15 times analysts’ average 2023 earnings per share estimate for the company.

General Electric (GE)

Offshore wind energy is now becoming much more popular as the technology supporting it has greatly improved. Offshore wind is important because, of course, it can be deployed without acquiring any land. So in places where land is very scarce and/or very expensive, like many coastal U.S. states and much of Europe, offshore wind will become a key means of generating more electricity.

General Electric’s (NYSE:GE) Renewables unit makes the Haliade-X, one of the most sought-after offshore wind turbines. One huge offshore wind project using the Haliade-X is Dogger Bank off the coast of England. Based on its contract with Dogger, GE is slated to provide 277 of its offshore turbines for the project. With construction having recently started on the massive project, I expect significant revenue to soon start rolling in for GE from Dogger.

Meanwhile, GE’s Power unit should benefit from the construction of many new power plants as the demand for electricity surges, and its Aviation unit should get a big lift from consumers’ pent-up demand for travel.

The shares of Shoals (NASDAQ:SHLS), which makes equipment used in solar projects, recently soared, reaching their highest level in over a month, even though its first-quarter results came in slightly below expectations.

More specifically, the company’s revenue jumped 49% year-over-year to $68 million, but that was $2 million below analysts’ average outlook. On the bottom line, Shoals reported EPS of 5 cents, unchanged versus the same period a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were expecting the company’s EPS to come in at 7 cents.

However, it’s likely that, due to worries about the impact of the Commerce Department’s investigation, many on the Street were expecting Shoals’ results to be much worse.

Additionally, the company noted that, despite high inflation, its gross margins had jumped 5.5 percentage points versus the previous quarter to 38.7%, while its backlog and awarded orders had soared 67% YOY to $302.3 million, an all-time high.

“Demand for the new products we introduced recently continues to grow with customer orders for our battery storage and wire management offerings being particularly strong,” said Shoals CEO Jason Whitaker.

When it comes to 2022 guidance, the company lowered the top end of its net income outlook, but kept the lower end of the range intact. It now expects its full-year net income, excluding some items, to come in at $45 million to $53 million.

Clearly, the demand for Shoals’ products and the company’s profitability are very strong. As the demand for solar explodes, those trends should strengthen going forward.

Like GE, Orsted (OTCMKTS:DNNGY) is well-positioned to benefit a great deal from the rapidly increasing demand for offshore wind turbines.

Since Orsted is based in Denmark, the company is even better suited than GE to get big boosts from the E.U.’s efforts to stop importing Russian gas. As of April, according to Rystead Energy, “New offshore wind capacity additions in Europe are poised to hit a record high of 4.2 GW this year, topping 4 GW for the first time and more than doubling additions seen in 2021,” offshorewind.biz reported. In 2023, 7.3 GW of new offshore wind projects are expected to be added.

Not to be left out, the U.S. has started auctioning off large amounts of its waters off the East Coast to firms looking to build huge offshore wind projects. Orsted already owns the “the Block Island Wind Farm, America’s first offshore wind farm” and has been awarded enough waters off the East Coast to build 5 gigawatts of wind turbines.

7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Investors Catch On

In Q1, Orsted’s EBITDA jumped to 9.4 billion Danish krones, way up from 4.8 billion Danish krones during the same period a year earlier. This makes it a solid pick among undervalued renewable energy stocks.

On May 17, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock announced that it had received an order from H2 Energy Europe for a 1 GW electrolyzer. The product will be incorporated into a green hydrogen production complex in Denmark, and the deal represents “the largest capacity electrolyzer installation in the world to date,” Plug stated.

The electrolyzer will help create “up to 100,000 metric tonnes per year of green hydrogen,” the company added.

The deal indicates that Plug’s large electrolyzer business is well-positioned to boost the company’s top and bottom lines, greatly lifting PLUG stock in the process.

“We see green hydrogen as the future and have made significant investments in green hydrogen including in the construction of a gigafactory for electrolyzer production,” Andy Marsh, Plug’s CEO said in a statement.

Trading with a market capitalization of $9.5 billion, I believe PLUG stock vastly underrates the company’s truly vast opportunity in the hydrogen sector.

The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) Invesco logo in blue with mountain image

The Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) gives relatively conservative investors a good chance to get exposure to a wide variety of solar stocks. TAN stock also eliminates the need for investors to worry about picking the best names — or even the best categories — within the space.

Moreover, the ETF’s largest holdings include a good mix of Western companies, such as Enphase (NASDAQ:ENPH), Solaredge (NASDAQ:SEDG), Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN), and First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) along with China-based firms, including Xinyi Solar Holdings and Daqo New Energy (NYSE:DQ).

Given the huge growth of solar energy, the ETF’s price-earnings ratio of 37 is quite attractive.

7 Oil Stocks to Buy With Safe Dividends

In an April 7 column, Seeking Alpha’s Stock Waves wrote that “Conditions are ripe for a sizable rally in solar stocks.” That rally may be just beginning to materialize, and TAN stock gives cautious investors a good, relatively safe way to benefit from the rally.

EVgo (EVGO) An image of two Evgo, Inc. (EVGO) charging stations

I feel comfortable including EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) on this list of undervalued renewable energy stocks because the company appears to be the only American, pure-play EV charger maker that gets 100% of its electricity from renewable energy.

As I pointed out in a recent column, EVgo also has the largest U.S. network of fast chargers of any independent company in the U.S. i.e. any firm that’s not named Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In fact, EVgo says that “More than 130 million people in the US live within a 10 mile drive of an EVgo fast charger.” As EV sales boom, the ubiquity of the company’s chargers should make them convenient and accessible for tens of millions of Americans.

And as I’ve noted previously, EVgo’s partnerships with multiple top automakers and a number of large retailers leave it well-positioned to gain market share and mind share in the consumer market.

I continue to think that the $2.4 billion market capitalization of EVGO stock is a bargain, given the company’s gargantuan opportunity.

808,Shanghai’s Neighborhood Covid Enforcers Keep Lockdowns Going Even as Cases Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- Shanghai has been officially easing a lockdown that kept its 25 million residents home-bound for nearly two months following a decline in Covid-19 cases, but an army of zealous grassroots volunteers who police housing compounds are still banning many people from going outside.

Neighborhood committees around the city are imposing strict and arbitrary curbs on movement, including limits on who can leave their apartment blocks and for how long -- amid concerns about a rebound in cases. The moves are seeing simmering frustrations boil over as people push for freedoms that top city officials have promised, while local cadres fear repercussions if residents return home with an infection.

Nearly 85% of Shanghai’s residents, or 21 million people, live in compounds or districts that are free of the virus, according to a tally released by the municipal government. These so-called ‘preventive’ areas were supposed to have the lowest level of movement restrictions, allowing people to leave their apartment complexes and walk around their neighborhoods.

For millions of people, that isn’t happening. According to about a dozen residents across the city, many are still facing a variety of restrictions from their local committees. In some cases, they can only venture 20 meters (66 feet) -- about the length of a bowling alley -- from their housing complexes.

The experiences suggest Shanghai’s path to exiting weeks of isolation will be bumpy, reflecting the challenges for China as it continues to deploy the Covid Zero framework despite the very real risk of a rebound in infections.

Xi in a Bind Over Who to Blame for Shanghai’s Covid Outbreak

Story continues

There are legions of neighborhood committees across China, ubiquitous grassroots organizations that function as coordinators of all sorts of government policies. They are responsible for everything from enforcing lockdowns to household registrations, and have been competing with one another to eradicate the virus from their jurisdictions.

Tiptoeing Forward

In some areas of Shanghai, residents are restricted to 20-minute time slots, three times a day to venture out, with the distances one can go limited. One committee in the eastern part of the city last week recognized the effort required to be deemed a ‘preventive area,’ and told residents the curbs were needed to limit risks from the surrounding areas.

Some aren’t allowed out at all. The authority in Minhang district, in the city’s southwest, banned people from leaving their homes or compounds between May 25 and 26, regardless of their lockdown status. The reason given was that another round of mass testing is set to be carried out, according to an official notice.

Elsewhere in the city, neighborhood committees restricted the number of family members that could leave their compounds, and put in place rules about the purpose and length of the trips. Some required households to share special leave passes during designated time slots.

Another committee mandated that they could only be used once, with each building given a single pass. Trips were limited to shopping at a nearby Walmart Inc. store, and could last only three hours.

Covid Punishments

The varied lockdown measures imposed by neighborhood committees suggest that low-level government officials, who work closely with them, are concerned that they’ll be penalized if new cases pop up in their jurisdictions.

China has punished more than 4,000 officials in relation to some 51 local Covid outbreaks, according to a Bloomberg analysis of data released by state media and Communist Party disciplinary authorities. Most of the more than 15 officials reprimanded over the Shanghai lockdown so far have been low-ranking bureaucrats, with none exceeding a district-level rank.

The city’s vice mayor said last week that Shanghai aims to return to normal life and restore full factory production by mid-to-late June. On Sunday, officials laid out the criteria they will use to categorize Covid risk levels in neighborhoods, as authorities seek to try and end the lockdown ordeal for residents.

The restrictions have been hugely disruptive for industry and business, too, with manufacturers like Tesla Inc. shut down or delayed for weeks. Airbnb Inc. said Monday it was closing its operations in China because of the aggressive approach to containing Covid. Beijing has flagged more than $21 billion in tax relief to bolster the economy, which is being hammered by Covid Zero.

Overall, Shanghai is finally seeing its outbreak dwindle. There were 558 new cases reported for Sunday, a decrease from 622 a day earlier, and none were found outside of government quarantine.

One woman, fed up with the restrictions, used a megaphone to urge her neighbors to “lift the lockdown by ourselves,” according to a widely circulated video on the social media app WeChat.

Another showed residents pouring out of their compound after government representatives listened to their complaints and unlocked the gates. Since none had been given a pass, however, they all took pictures and then went back inside.

By Chris Prentice and Michelle Price

WASHINGTON, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators have pulled their punches in dealings with Elon Musk largely because an April 2019 court hearing on a statement he made about Tesla on Twitter didn't go their way, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the court to hold the billionaire in contempt, saying a tweet by the Tesla Inc. CEO - which forecast production at the carmaker - violated a court agreement Musk signed the previous year to have some of his communications vetted by a lawyer.

By trying to rein in his comments, the SEC was veering into relatively uncharted territory. SEC rules require that public companies and their executives disclose accurate information that may be material to investors via channels that investors know to monitor. It doesn't usually specify how companies should do that.

But the 2019 remarks by judge Alison Nathan – who found the terms of the agreement between Musk and the SEC to be ""soft"" and urged them to reach an understanding – knocked confidence among officials overseeing the case that the courts would support them if they attempted to prosecute his activity on Twitter, the four sources said.

Interviews with individuals familiar with the situation – as well as a review of court documents, SEC and Tesla emails obtained by the media through a public records request – showed that in the wake of Nathan's comments, SEC officials opted to urge Musk to comply with the agreement, rather than pursuing enforcement through the courts.

Story continues

Spokespeople for the SEC declined to comment on its enforcement dealings with Musk. Spokespeople for Tesla and Twitter and a representative for Judge Nathan did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, did not respond to requests for comment on the SEC's deliberations, but court records and Tesla emails show he and other lawyers for the Tesla boss dispute that Musk's tweets violated the agreement.

With Musk's use of social media under scrutiny after he bid to purchase Twitter, the interviews and documents shed light on the regulator's view of its relationship with the billionaire, now the world's richest man. He has 95 million Twitter followers and called the SEC ""bastards"" in an interview in April .

The sources said they are not familiar with the current thinking of the SEC, which has been under new leadership since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. Under new Chair, Gary Gensler, the agency has pledged to crack down on repeated misconduct and push for tougher penalties.

It recently opened more investigations into Musk. Among them, a probe into two of his November tweets asking if he should sell shares in Tesla, court documents regarding Musk's settlement with the SEC show.

Nathan was promoted to the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March. A newly assigned judge in the case, Lewis Liman, ruled in the SEC's favor last month.

""MATERIAL INFORMATION""

The SEC's fight with Musk started on Aug. 7, 2018, when the CEO, whose company had been telling investors to monitor his Twitter feed since 2013, sent Tesla shares soaring by tweeting ""funding secured"" to take the publicly listed company private. The SEC opened an investigation: It found Musk at the time had not even discussed key deal terms with any potential funding source, SEC court filings later showed.

Musk says funding was secured.

In September 2018, agency officials told Musk he had a choice: Fight stiff charges over the tweet in court or settle and suffer lesser penalties, one of the sources said. Tesla shares were around $300 compared with more than $650 today. Musk agreed to settle.

During the April 4, 2019 hearing, in comments to the SEC about the settlement's language on what tweets should be vetted, Nathan said, ""This case is unusual."" Her exploration of the terms of the settlement has not previously been reported in detail.

The settlement required Tesla to establish a process for overseeing all of Musk's communications about the company, including hiring or designating an ""experienced securities lawyer"" to vet social media posts. Musk also agreed that he would certify in writing that he had complied, and provide proof; and to step down as Tesla chair while remaining CEO. No end-date was set for the arrangement.

The vetting process required that Musk seek pre-approval for written communications – including tweets – that contained ""or reasonably could contain"" information material to Tesla shareholders.

But the decision on whether they contained material information was left to Musk and Tesla.

Less than six months later, on Feb. 19, 2019, Musk tweeted that Tesla would make ""around 500k"" cars that year. If unvetted, this was arguably a violation of the settlement because production figures can be market sensitive information, SEC officials said in court filings.

The SEC staff asked Tesla whether Musk had submitted the tweet for vetting. He had not, Tesla attorneys told the SEC. The SEC said in the court complaint that when it looked into the Feb. 2019 tweet, it found Musk had not sought pre-approval for any Tesla-related tweets since the vetting system started. Its attorney told the court, ""Mr. Musk has tweeted upward of 80 times about Tesla, and the SEC thought nothing of it. We assumed that everyone was proceeding in good faith.""

Tesla attorneys said in a court filing Musk had not sought pre-approval because he ""has not tweeted material information regarding Tesla.""

""REASONABLENESS PANTS""

For SEC officials, Musk's violation was clear, four of the sources told Reuters.

In April 2019 they went to the New York court to argue that Musk should be held in contempt of court – a serious charge that can result in fines or jail. The SEC wanted the court to order Musk to report monthly to the agency on his compliance and enforce escalating fines for violations, its lawyer told the judge at the hearing.

SEC officials felt they had the upper hand because they believed the violation was unambiguous, said the four sources, two of whom have direct knowledge of the matter.

Following a 1976 Supreme Court ruling, the SEC's rules have defined material information that a public company must disclose as matters ""a reasonable investor"" would likely consider important. The regulator's requirement in the deal with Musk was broader than that, it told the court: ""We would argue it essentially means unless something is obviously immaterial, it needs to get pre-approval.""

Musk's lawyers told the court the SEC's interpretation of the settlement's vetting requirements was ""incorrect"" and ""overbroad.""

Judge Nathan challenged what she described as the settlement's ""soft"" standard for assessing when a tweet was material, the court transcript shows; she also agreed with Musk's lawyer that the SEC should have tried to resolve the issue out of court, saying, ""This screams of working it out.""

Nathan did not conclude whether the tweets were material, or rule on the contempt motion, saying: ""My call to action is for everybody to take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on, and work this out.""

SEC officials felt they had no choice but to revise the settlement, according to the four sources. The SEC, Tesla and Musk agreed to be more specific about what comments must be pre-approved – including statements about Tesla's financial condition, proposed or potential deals, production numbers, and performance projections.

Nathan approved that revised agreement on April 30, 2019.

THE TWEETS GO ON

In the following months, SEC officials felt Musk pushed the boundaries of the revised settlement but were reluctant to return to court, fearing Nathan might reject their complaint and admonish them for bringing the issue back, three sources said.

On July 29, 2019, Musk tweeted that he was hoping to manufacture ""1,000 solar roofs"" a week by year-end; and on May 1, 2020 that Tesla's stock price was ""too high."" Each tweet prompted the SEC to contact Tesla and Musk's attorneys seeking information on whether they had been pre-approved, according to SEC correspondence sent to Tesla on the matter obtained by public records requests.

Musk had not sought pre-approval; Tesla's attorneys argued in the emails to the SEC it wasn't necessary. The regulator disagreed. The SEC said in emails it was trying to work out the dispute ""in the spirit of the Court's directive"" but that Tesla and Musk's attorneys had declined to provide requested documents, or have a ""productive dialogue"" with SEC staff.

In June 2020, the SEC emailed Musk advising him it was the ""SEC's position that you violated"" the settlement.

Instead of returning to court, however, the SEC said: ""Going forward, we urge you to comply.""

Some SEC officials felt the settlement constrained Musk to some degree, which helped protect investors, said the four sources.

The SEC also was uneasy about the risks of the most extreme step – scrapping the deal and starting litigation – given Musk's resources, four of the sources said.

In addition, Musk was and remains Tesla's largest shareholder, with roughly 16% of the stock as of late April, so it might be hard to argue that barring him as a public company director or officer was in shareholders' interests or would loosen his grip on Tesla, two of the sources said.

In March, Musk asked the court to void his settlement with the SEC.

The new judge in the case, Liman, rejected Musk's appeal in April. He found the billionaire was ""bemoaning"" the 2018 deal now that he felt Tesla was ""invincible"". A representative for the court said Liman would not comment.

Bush in Revenge for Iraq War Was Foiled, FBI Says Broadcom in Talks to Acquire Cloud Company VMware Biden’s Latest Taiwan Gaffe Stokes Tensions With Beijing

Hours before FX and Hulu released Elon Musk’s Crash Course, a New York Times documentary outlining how Tesla’s chief executive officer has oversold his company’s automated-driving capabilities, the billionaire made a foreboding Friday afternoon announcement.

“Tesla is building a hardcore litigation department where we directly initiate & execute lawsuits,” Musk tweeted. He wrote that the team would report directly to him and declared he was looking for “streetfighters” and “out for blood.”

At first, the film’s director and producer, Emma Schwartz, didn’t know what to make of Musk’s posts. It seemed likely they were in response to Insider’s report that SpaceX had paid $250,000 to settle a sexual misconduct claim a former flight attendant made against the billionaire in 2018.

Then again, “that was SpaceX, and he was saying he wanted to start a litigation department at Tesla,” Schwartz said in an interview on Monday. She wondered if something else is happening with the carmaker, such as potential regulatory action. The documentary notes in its closing credits that the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened two defect investigations into Tesla’s driver-assistance system Autopilot.

The probes aren’t the only reasons to suspect something is up in Washington pertaining to Tesla.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has been probing whether Musk and his brother Kimbal, a Tesla board member, violated insider-trading rules when the two sold shares in the carmaker late last year. The SEC also sent Tesla a subpoena in November about a subject that refuses to go away: Musk’s tweeting and the carmaker’s governance and compliance processes.

And last month, Tesla revealed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had started investigating the company before California’s civil rights agency alleged racism is rampant at its California car factory, and claimed it was caught up in a “turf war” between the federal and state regulators.

It would be entirely unsurprising, however, if Musk’s lawyering up does indeed have to do with a clash over the safety of Autopilot and the Full Self-Driving features that Tesla has been selling for years before they live up to their name. And if this is what’s happening, it would be a mistake to fall for Musk’s framing of what’s to come as political motivated “dirty tricks” intended to derail his fight for free speech.

In two of the most memorable moments in Schwartz’s documentary, former NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas and former National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt describe what happened when their agencies informed Tesla they were opening investigations into two fatal crashes involving Autopilot — the first in Florida in 2016, and the second two years later in California.

Thomas recounts how Musk started shouting at NHTSA’s general counsel, accusing the agency of unfairly singling Tesla out and suggesting the company would sue. Musk was similarly argumentative and threatening toward the NTSB before hanging up on Sumwalt.

Both these incidents were reported previously, but this doesn’t take away from the drama of Thomas and Sumwalt’s retelling. Tesla is also starting to feel actual consequences: S&P Dow Jones Indices cited how the company has handled NHTSA’s investigation of deaths and injuries linked to Autopilot as among the reasons it removed the company from the ESG version of the S&P 500 Index.

Schwartz said it was difficult to convince former Tesla employees to go on camera for the documentary because of Musk’s influence and litigiousness. One of the factors that worked in her favor: Musk has freely spoken many times over the years about Tesla being on the cusp of solving self-driving, only to emphasize the limitations of its driver-assistance system when crashes occur.

“So many years have gone by with so many promises,” she said. “Especially with the launch of the FSD beta, it’s kind of ratcheted up the question even further. And while it’s not like we’ve seen loads of fatal accidents — which certainly the Tesla fans will note — it’s also pretty clear that the technology is a long way off from being fully self-driving.”

825,Tesla loses bid to move sexual harassment lawsuit to arbitration,"By Daniel Wiessner

(Reuters) -A California state judge has rejected Tesla Inc's bid to send a lawsuit alleging widespread sexual harassment at the company's flagship assembly plant to private arbitration, allowing it to move forward in court.

California Superior Court Judge Stephen Kaus in Oakland denied Tesla's motion to compel arbitration in a brief order on Monday.

In a written opinion released on Tuesday, Kaus said Tesla had improperly pressured the plaintiff, Jessica Barraza, to sign an arbitration agreement after she had already quit her previous job.

""Basically, Barraza was ambushed,"" the judge wrote.

Barraza in the lawsuit filed in November claims workers and supervisors at the Fremont, California plant routinely made lewd comments and gestures to female employees, and that the company failed to address complaints.

The lawsuit is one of at least seven pending in California state court to make similar claims against Tesla. Kaus is presiding over five more of those cases.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

David Lowe, a lawyer for Barraza, called the decision ""a victory for public accountability.""

""Because of this ruling... Tesla will be judged by a jury of Ms. Barraza's peers in a public courtroom,"" Lowe said in a statement.

Along with the pending sexual harassment claims, Tesla is facing separate lawsuits accusing it of tolerating widespread race discrimination at its plants. A California judge last month awarded $15 million to a Black former factory worker who said he was subjected to racist slurs and graffiti from coworkers.

Tesla has said it does not tolerate harassment and has disciplined and fired workers who engaged in misconduct.

827,Tesla stock falls from top spot in Cathie Wood’s flagship ARK ETF,"Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova joins the Live show to discuss Cathie Wood's ARK Invest trimming its stake in Tesla stock.

Video Transcript

- Switching gears, Cathie Wood is hitting the brakes on Tesla as the EV maker fails-- excuse me, falls to the second spot in the Ark Innovation ETF, it's first fall from the top spot in nearly five years. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Smirnova joins us with the details. And this took me by surprise because she has made it clear over the years, right? Tesla was 10% or 11% at one point. How did this happen?

ALEXANDRA EMENOVA: Yeah, that's right, Jared. Tesla has lost its top spot as the top holding in Ark Invest's flagship exchange traded fund. The company slipped down late last week following Roku and then briefly slipped to third place before Cathie Wood bought up $10 million worth of shares yesterday that bought it back to second place.

Very interesting given that Tesla has held this position for nearly five years as its top holding. Up until recently, Tesla has also been a relative outperformer for Ark as its other stock picks, you know, just saw a tremendous downturn. And it's been steadily trimming its stake in Tesla now for four consecutive quarters.

The value of Tesla that Ark owns now has shrunk by half since the beginning of the year. So I did reach out to Ark Invest, and I asked them to explain this. But they declined to comment.

- But at the same time, they declined to comment specifically, but you know, they're pretty-- they talk often, right? They're pretty transparent. Do we know why we-- do we have any clues as to why we've seen this slip amongst the top holdings?

ALEXANDRA EMENOVA: I mean, there's no doubt that Cathie is still a big Tesla bull. Last week when Tesla got booted off of the S&P 500's ESG index, she quickly came to its defense on Twitter and called it ridiculous. Last month, she raised her price target on Tesla to $4,600 by 2026.

So a big Tesla bull. So this certainly could be a matter of the mechanics of the daily trade activity. But it does raise the question, as we see Tesla-- as we see growing investor concerns about Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, it does raise the question about whether Cathie Wood is slightly less bullish, perhaps. And it certainly wouldn't mark the first time that she, you know, drastically changes her mind last month as she invested in General Motors after, you know, warning that the company could go bankrupt just a few months ago.

So she has a lot of explaining to do to investors. Sure, Cathie Wood is pretty transparent in terms of publishing her daily trade activity and research notes. But as the fun continues to fall, a lot of her moves have been really raising eyebrows among investors.

- Well, key line there I'm kind of honing in on is that Tesla has not fallen as much as the others. So if she's punting along in some of these disruption names that have been so beaten down, she might just see the opportunity for quick. And she is a trader and it is actively [INAUDIBLE]. So maybe that's what she's doing. But nevertheless, thank you for that, Alexandra Semenova.",2022-05-24T14:45:27+00:00

By Chris Prentice and Michelle Price

WASHINGTON, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators have pulled their punches in dealings with Elon Musk largely because an April 2019 court hearing on a statement he made about Tesla on Twitter didn't go their way, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the court to hold the billionaire in contempt, saying a tweet by the Tesla Inc. CEO - which forecast production at the carmaker - violated a court agreement Musk signed the previous year to have some of his communications vetted by a lawyer.

By trying to rein in his comments, the SEC was veering into relatively uncharted territory. SEC rules require that public companies and their executives disclose accurate information that may be material to investors via channels that investors know to monitor. It doesn't usually specify how companies should do that.

But the 2019 remarks by judge Alison Nathan – who found the terms of the agreement between Musk and the SEC to be ""soft"" and urged them to reach an understanding – knocked confidence among officials overseeing the case that the courts would support them if they attempted to prosecute his activity on Twitter, the four sources said.

Interviews with individuals familiar with the situation – as well as a review of court documents, SEC and Tesla emails obtained by the media through a public records request – showed that in the wake of Nathan's comments, SEC officials opted to urge Musk to comply with the agreement, rather than pursuing enforcement through the courts.

Story continues

Spokespeople for the SEC declined to comment on its enforcement dealings with Musk. Spokespeople for Tesla and Twitter and a representative for Judge Nathan did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, did not respond to requests for comment on the SEC's deliberations, but court records and Tesla emails show he and other lawyers for the Tesla boss dispute that Musk's tweets violated the agreement.

With Musk's use of social media under scrutiny after he bid to purchase Twitter, the interviews and documents shed light on the regulator's view of its relationship with the billionaire, now the world's richest man. He has 95 million Twitter followers and called the SEC ""bastards"" in an interview in April .

The sources said they are not familiar with the current thinking of the SEC, which has been under new leadership since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. Under new Chair, Gary Gensler, the agency has pledged to crack down on repeated misconduct and push for tougher penalties.

It recently opened more investigations into Musk. Among them, a probe into two of his November tweets asking if he should sell shares in Tesla, court documents regarding Musk's settlement with the SEC show.

Nathan was promoted to the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March. A newly assigned judge in the case, Lewis Liman, ruled in the SEC's favor last month.

""MATERIAL INFORMATION""

The SEC's fight with Musk started on Aug. 7, 2018, when the CEO, whose company had been telling investors to monitor his Twitter feed since 2013, sent Tesla shares soaring by tweeting ""funding secured"" to take the publicly listed company private. The SEC opened an investigation: It found Musk at the time had not even discussed key deal terms with any potential funding source, SEC court filings later showed.

Musk says funding was secured.

In September 2018, agency officials told Musk he had a choice: Fight stiff charges over the tweet in court or settle and suffer lesser penalties, one of the sources said. Tesla shares were around $300 compared with more than $630 today after a five-for-one stock split in 2020. Musk agreed to settle.

During the April 4, 2019 hearing, in comments to the SEC about the settlement's language on what tweets should be vetted, Nathan said, ""This case is unusual."" Her exploration of the terms of the settlement has not previously been reported in detail.

The settlement required Tesla to establish a process for overseeing all of Musk's communications about the company, including hiring or designating an ""experienced securities lawyer"" to vet social media posts. Musk also agreed that he would certify in writing that he had complied, and provide proof; and to step down as Tesla chair while remaining CEO. No end-date was set for the arrangement.

The vetting process required that Musk seek pre-approval for written communications – including tweets – that contained ""or reasonably could contain"" information material to Tesla shareholders.

But the decision on whether they contained material information was left to Musk and Tesla.

Less than six months later, on Feb. 19, 2019, Musk tweeted that Tesla would make ""around 500k"" cars that year. If unvetted, this was arguably a violation of the settlement because production figures can be market sensitive information, SEC officials said in court filings.

The SEC staff asked Tesla whether Musk had submitted the tweet for vetting. He had not, Tesla attorneys told the SEC. The SEC said in the court complaint that when it looked into the Feb. 2019 tweet, it found Musk had not sought pre-approval for any Tesla-related tweets since the vetting system started. Its attorney told the court, ""Mr. Musk has tweeted upward of 80 times about Tesla, and the SEC thought nothing of it. We assumed that everyone was proceeding in good faith.""

Tesla attorneys said in a court filing Musk had not sought pre-approval because he ""has not tweeted material information regarding Tesla.""

""REASONABLENESS PANTS""

For SEC officials, Musk's violation was clear, four of the sources told Reuters.

In April 2019 they went to the New York court to argue that Musk should be held in contempt of court – a serious charge that can result in fines or jail. The SEC wanted the court to order Musk to report monthly to the agency on his compliance and enforce escalating fines for violations, its lawyer told the judge at the hearing.

SEC officials felt they had the upper hand because they believed the violation was unambiguous, said the four sources, two of whom have direct knowledge of the matter.

Following a 1976 Supreme Court ruling, the SEC's rules have defined material information that a public company must disclose as matters ""a reasonable investor"" would likely consider important. The regulator's requirement in the deal with Musk was broader than that, it told the court: ""We would argue it essentially means unless something is obviously immaterial, it needs to get pre-approval.""

Musk's lawyers told the court the SEC's interpretation of the settlement's vetting requirements was ""incorrect"" and ""overbroad.""

Judge Nathan challenged what she described as the settlement's ""soft"" standard for assessing when a tweet was material, the court transcript shows; she also agreed with Musk's lawyer that the SEC should have tried to resolve the issue out of court, saying, ""This screams of working it out.""

Nathan did not conclude whether the tweets were material, or rule on the contempt motion, saying: ""My call to action is for everybody to take a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on, and work this out.""

SEC officials felt they had no choice but to revise the settlement, according to the four sources. The SEC, Tesla and Musk agreed to be more specific about what comments must be pre-approved – including statements about Tesla's financial condition, proposed or potential deals, production numbers, and performance projections.

Nathan approved that revised agreement on April 30, 2019.

THE TWEETS GO ON

In the following months, SEC officials felt Musk pushed the boundaries of the revised settlement but were reluctant to return to court, fearing Nathan might reject their complaint and admonish them for bringing the issue back, three sources said.

On July 29, 2019, Musk tweeted that he was hoping to manufacture ""1,000 solar roofs"" a week by year-end; and on May 1, 2020 that Tesla's stock price was ""too high."" Each tweet prompted the SEC to contact Tesla and Musk's attorneys seeking information on whether they had been pre-approved, according to SEC correspondence sent to Tesla on the matter obtained by public records requests.

Musk had not sought pre-approval; Tesla's attorneys argued in the emails to the SEC it wasn't necessary. The regulator disagreed. The SEC said in emails it was trying to work out the dispute ""in the spirit of the Court's directive"" but that Tesla and Musk's attorneys had declined to provide requested documents, or have a ""productive dialogue"" with SEC staff.

In June 2020, the SEC emailed Musk advising him it was the ""SEC's position that you violated"" the settlement.

Instead of returning to court, however, the SEC said: ""Going forward, we urge you to comply.""

Some SEC officials felt the settlement constrained Musk to some degree, which helped protect investors, said the four sources.

The SEC also was uneasy about the risks of the most extreme step – scrapping the deal and starting litigation – given Musk's resources, four of the sources said.

In addition, Musk was and remains Tesla's largest shareholder, with roughly 16% of the stock as of late April, so it might be hard to argue that barring him as a public company director or officer was in shareholders' interests or would loosen his grip on Tesla, two of the sources said.

In March, Musk asked the court to void his settlement with the SEC.

The new judge in the case, Liman, rejected Musk's appeal in April. He found the billionaire was ""bemoaning"" the 2018 deal now that he felt Tesla was ""invincible"". A representative for the court said Liman would not comment.

Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: Well, about 4% of new cars sold last year in the US were electric. That's up 50% from 2020. And their popularity is only growing. But what do you do when you run out of juice? Our next guest has a solution in the form of portable chargers. Let's bring in SparkCharge founder and CEO, Josh Aviv. And Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian also here with us at the desk. Josh, it's great to talk to you. Let's start with the model that SparkCharge offers, because I think this is a really interesting one. We talk about stationary chargers. Yours is portable, but also includes a subscription service.

JOSH AVIV: Absolutely. Yeah, and thank you guys for having me on the episode today. At SparkCharge, we've basically created a way for electric vehicle owners to have their car charged any time and anywhere they want. And with our mobile app, currently, an EV owner can, with the push of a button, have range delivered to them any time and anywhere they want, at home, at work, on the go. It really opens up a brand new way of EV charging that makes life far more convenient.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Josh, Pras here. So you guys announced some new funding today, $23 million. What are you going to do with that money? Where do you plan on expanding and things like that?

JOSH AVIV: Absolutely. I mean, we want to be in over 20 cities over the next couple of months. We're already in LA, San Francisco, San Jose, in Dallas, Texas. We'll be opening up Boston here pretty soon and another city a couple of months after that. But this funding is really to help us scale that network so that in every city, an EV owner can, with the push of a button, have range delivered anywhere they want.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So would you say the business model is more about providing that service to communities that are underserved? Or is there also a secondary usage here, where people are sort of, they run out of juice on the road?

Story continues

JOSH AVIV: Yeah, so our business model with the currently platform is really around opening up convenience. So I believe 60% of all the people who use our mobile app actually get range delivered to their house. Another 40% actually get range delivered to where they work, their job. And the beauty of that is the fact that you can schedule that charge. So you can be on your way out the door, push a button, and have range waiting for you at your office. You can be on your way from the grocery store and have range waiting for you at your home. And that really opens up the door to the flexibility where the EV owner doesn't have to worry about where, when, and how they charge their car.

One of the things that's come out of that is the fact that when we go into a city, we blanket it with energy. So we're not just putting one pole in the ground. We are literally putting a coverage of energy in that city. And what we found is that there's a lot of communities that sometimes get left out or what we like to call charging deserts, where, essentially, low income communities don't have access to EV charging and are barred from the green economy. But when we think about mobile charging, it removes all those barriers for every community and every EV owner.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Josh, serious question, but before I get there, I just want to ask quickly, I understand that you're a Syracuse alum. I am, too. You factually founded this idea from your dorm room? What dorm hall were you in?

JOSH AVIV: So when I founded this idea, it was Booth Hall.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Booth, OK. I was a Brewster guy. So I guess the juices weren't flowing, at least, in that dorm hall. But on a serious note, I want to ask you, obviously, the ecosystem of these types of charging infrastructures is very different now than perhaps when you were ideating this in your dorm room. How exactly do you feel you fit in within the universe of chargers out there? Because there are some that are targeting certain types of retail locations, some that are superchargers on the roadside along the major highways. How do you think you fit into that ecosystem?

JOSH AVIV: Absolutely. So I mean, when you think about it, as the electric vehicle market has grown, so has SparkCharge. So when you think about the fact that when you're talking about these retail locations, sometimes they're only putting one or two charging stations in the ground. And that's really not enough to service the amount of EV owners that are going to be hitting the roads.

On top of that, our technology is often, sometimes, 8 to 14 times faster than the infrastructure that's already previously been installed, especially with level 2. And when we think about where our technology is going, our charging stations are going to be faster than a Tesla destination supercharger, right? And they're going to be able to be delivered to you, regardless of where you're at. And when we think about how trends follow and how society moves, if you can make something more convenient and more cost affordable, then that's typically the route that people go. And we believe that mobile charging will be the dominant way that people charge their car going forward.

AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Josh, you mentioned Tesla. I thought it was interesting you also have a partnership with Kia for these two-month subscriptions. And it seems like, increasingly, it's that-- those two pieces that need to come together. You purchase a car, knowing that the charging station is going to be there. You guys use lithium ion batteries to power the chargers. What does the supply look like for you right now? We've heard a lot about the huge demand in lithium, whether, in fact, that demand can be met. What are you seeing in your pipeline?

JOSH AVIV: Absolutely. I mean, really, what it comes down to is relationships, right? I think that's really what's going to be the biggest differentiator when it comes to lithium ion supply, making sure you have a relationship with that supplier. From the SparkCharge standpoint, we've been in this industry for a number of years. And what we've really seen is that back in the day, you could place an order for a pallet of lithium ion cells and maybe get it within a couple of months, right?

Now you really have to plan that a little bit further out, almost six to eight months out in advance, really trying to figure out your supply chains, that you always have product available. We manufacture every single product here in the United States in Buffalo, New York. We've manufactured here stateside from the beginning of the inception of the company.

And so, we've really been able to be fortunate where if someone wants our product, we can ship it out right away. We're not waiting for it to be put on a boat and brought over here. We manufacture it here directly. And so, that's something that we're proud of. But to answer your question, it's really about forecasting and getting ahead of supply chain. And that's how we've been able to stay ahead today.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Josh, so you guys raised money from Mark Cuban, one of your early investors. What's it like working with him? And you actually went on ""Shark Tank,"" too. What was that whole experience like for you?

JOSH AVIV: Absolutely. Yeah, working with Mark has been phenomenal. And the ""Shark Tank"" family has been absolutely great. When we think about it, going on ""Shark Tank,"" our goal was to really bring the conversation of electric vehicles into the homes of millions of people. And we were extremely successful doing that, right? I mean, the outpouring that we've gotten from people supporting that episode, I think to date, it's one of the highest rated episodes. About 3.6 million people tuned in for that season opener, and I think we've got other millions that have been shared via social media with views.

So it's been absolutely phenomenal. And working with Mark, he's been absolutely great. I mean, working with him, his team, you send him an email, he always gets back to you. He's always there for advice. And he owns a couple of electric vehicles. So, you know, he truly believes in this market. So it's just been a pleasure working with him.

BRIAN CHEUNG: All right, SparkCharge founder and CEO, Josh Aviv, and Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian-- go Orange, by the way. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.

Social Media Stocks Sink to Erase $160 Billion on Snap Warning S&P 500 Pares Drop Amid Gains in Defensive Shares: Markets Wrap Broadcom in Talks to Acquire Cloud Company VMware Biden’s Latest Taiwan Gaffe Stokes Tensions With Beijing Stocks Climb in Risk-On Day While Bonds Decline: Markets Wrap

“With about 13,000 units of production per week and higher than average margins, any production loss at Shanghai is bound to have a significant impact on margins and earnings,” said Daiwa analyst Jairam Nathan, who cut his price target to $800 from $1,150.

Until recently, Tesla was considered the ultimate growth stock, rising 50% last year and closing at $1,145 on April 4, when CEO Elon Musk announced his 9.2% stake in Twitter Inc. Since then, Musk has been engaged in highly public attempt to buy the social media platform. And Tesla’s stock has been in a freefall, sinking to around $635 and wiping out almost half its market capitalization since touching a record high in November.

Since Musk revealed his Twitter stake, Tesla shares have plunged 43% compared with a 14% decline in the S&P 500 Index and a 28% drop in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector. It’s the eighth worst performing stock in the S&P 500 over that time and the fourth biggest drag in terms of index points.

Tesla also has dramatically underperformed most of the market’s other major tech growth stocks since April 4, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc.. Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. Streaming service Netflix Inc. is the only FAANG name to be putting up a worse performance than Tesla since the news broke of Musk’s Twitter position.

All of this helps explain why Musk’s highly-public back-and-forth with Twitter has captivated markets, particularly as he sold $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to pay for the buyout. With the billionaire’s seeming recent reluctance to go forward with the purchase, Musk and Tesla are getting the wrong kind of publicity at a pivotal time for investors. The deal spread, or the difference between Musk’s offer price and Twitter’s share price, is $18, the widest since the takeover plan was announced in April.

Story continues

Beyond the Twitter distraction, Tesla’s key Shanghai factory has faced disruptions due to long-running Covid-19 lockdowns in the city. The company also was dropped from the ESG version of the S&P 500 earlier this month, a move that could lead to some forced selling by funds benchmarked to that gauge. And the company has also dealt with the supply shortages and surging raw material costs that other automakers face.

The broader market environment has also turned against highly valued growth companies with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to tame inflation. Goldman Sachs on Monday said hedge funds continue to reduce exposure to growth stocks, incrementally rotating away from Apple, Amazon and Tesla.

“Tesla is a high growth company, so the majority of its valuation is driven by future growth expectations,” said Seth Goldstein, equity strategist at Morningstar Research Services. “Even small changes in future growth assumptions can have a large impact on the stock’s valuation.”

“What we found is that there's a lot of communities that sometimes get left out, or what we like to call ‘charging deserts,’ where, essentially, low-income communities don't have access to EV charging and are barred from the green economy,” Aviv said. “But when we think about mobile charging, it removes all those barriers for every community and every EV owner.”

Aviv says 60% of customers use the Currently app to get range delivered to their homes, and 40% get it delivered to where they work. At this time, use of the service as a ""jumpstart,"" if you will, for stranded EV drivers is also available, but so far it’s only been used infrequently.

SparkCharge operates in four markets at the moment — Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, and Dallas — but with a new fundraising round announced on Tuesday, the company hopes to be in 20 additional markets soon.

The SparkCharge’s Series A funding round of $23 million was led by Tale Venture Partners, Pendulum, and also includes capital from entrepreneur and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban, who originally invested in the company after hearing Aviv’s pitch on the TV show.

""SparkCharge is thriving by offering a unique concierge service, while everyone else is pushing the same old, same old self serves,"" Cuban said in a statement. ""[The] Currently [app] makes charging convenient and accessible to a booming industry, reinvesting in them was an easy decision.""

836,"Tech stock sell-off ‘feels different’ than dot-com bubble, strategist says","Fitz-Gerald Group Principal Keith Fitz-Gerald sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the ongoing tech sell-off, how it may affect Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, the ripple effect surrounding Snap, and similarities to the dot-com bubble.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: It's great to see you. Emily was just discussing the massive selling that we're really seeing across a number of names in this industry. It doesn't look like this is a Snap specific story. But from your perspective, from your vantage point, how are you looking at the losses that we're seeing today?

KEITH FITZ-GERALD: Well, you've got to kind of take them in stride if you look at the market seriously. What management said at Snap really was, hey, we messed up. We didn't plan properly, and we can't execute. We don't even have enough reserves to meet our numbers. So when you cut right down to it, it's not illogical that everything else is going to go down as well, because people are beginning to realize that, hey, posting glamified pictures, doing the things on social media that everybody thought had value, maybe perhaps really doesn't. And that's a harsh reckoning for things today.

DAVE BRIGGS: But it did spread. Alphabet, Twitter, Meta, Uber, you name it, and 28%, the NASDAQ is down year to date. Is this 2000, Keith?

KEITH FITZ-GERALD: You know, it feels different to me. A lot of people are making that argument. But, you know, you've got companies here that have arguably real businesses. In 2000, you had talking stocks and Super Bowl commercials and fancy cars for companies that didn't have businesses. So I would submit this is a function of leverage. This is a function of the Fed rising rates and those concerns more than it is a day of reckoning a la 2000.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: A lot of people are wondering, is what we're seeing with Snap some sort of bellwether? Or is this more of a tech shakeout than really a tech route? What's your take on this?

KEITH FITZ-GERALD: That's a very interesting question because the nuance, of course, is significant. I think this is simply people realizing, hey, these things maybe aren't worth what we thought they might have been worth. To me, the fact that you've got privacy changes, you've got inflationary concerns, advertisers who are not playing the same ball that they did because every buck is harder to come by, and finally, you've got consumers post-pandemic who are actually going out and interested in living their lives, so you simply don't have as much screen time.

Story continues

To me, that's all cumulatively worth less. So, again, this isn't a surprise to me. It's something I've been seeing for a long time. We've been out of and away from and avoiding social media stocks for a long, long time. And frankly, I don't know that we're going to be back to them anytime soon.

SEANA SMITH: Hey, Keith, what do you think this means for Twitter and Elon Musk's deal? Because he reached a deal for-- to buy Twitter for $42 billion. Right now, Twitter's market cap is just around $27 billion. So what do you think happens next?

KEITH FITZ-GERALD: That's an interesting call, too. I've been giving a lot of thought to that one, because here's the thing, right, is Elon Musk is asking all the right questions. What about the bots? How does this look? I think he's right to question the legitimacy.

So if he walks away from this, and there's a billion dollars in damages, I think the bigger onus is on Twitter's board because they're going to be asking, oh, my goodness. We really don't want that to happen. Because Musk could spend a billion dollars at the blink of an eye and not even worry about it. Twitter, on the other hand, has got a very, very serious problem if he walks. So there's going to be some very intense discussions in the boardroom, I've got to imagine.

DAVE BRIGGS: But to your point, it would cost him a billion dollars to walk, although if you look at the $54.20 offer, Twitter's now at $35.76. Wouldn't it financially make sense to pay that billion, even if you intend to come back and offer a lower price?

KEITH FITZ-GERALD: Now you're in my wheelhouse. That's kind of what I'm looking at, is risk arbitrage here. If you're spending a billion to save five, you know, OK, that's a trade that begins to look interesting. And he's got the moxie to pull it off.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: But how much wiggle room does he actually have to get out of this deal?

KEITH FITZ-GERALD: You know, I don't know. I haven't seen the documents in enough detail. I'm not privy to the insider stuff that's been submitted there. I don't have the answers on how many bots are there, what the real traffic looks like. But again, thinking theoretically through this, it's a question of risk management, not simply buying low and selling high. So if you can spend a little bit to get a better price or a substantially better price, I think Musk is a smart guy, and he's going to do something on that order.

SEANA SMITH: Keith, speaking of Twitter, we heard that Twitter is freezing its hiring. We've heard that from a number of some of these bigger tech companies over the last several weeks. Now we're talking about reducing spending even further. Is this a trend that you see continuing for the second half of the year?

KEITH FITZ-GERALD: I do. You know, and again, it's going to be divided by what skill sets you're talking about, which kinds of companies you're talking about. Because for example, if you looked at carpenters, laborers, skilled trades, those things are in demand all across the board. You can't find somebody to work on your house if you want to. Or you can't find somebody to fix a pipe. But on the other hand, you know, you've got a lot of folks here who are arguably part of industries that are being crushed right now. That's the logical place to see those cutbacks.

DAVE BRIGGS: Keith, Rachelle used the term shakeout a bit earlier. How much of this is, going back a little bit, do we not realize the real impact of those Apple privacy changes on all social media stocks?

KEITH FITZ-GERALD: That, I think, is the question of the day, because Apple very early on adopted a, hey, we're serious about privacy. And we're not going to play these games approach. Now, arguably, a lot of people didn't like it, and a lot of people are split on the decision. But I think the ripples are going to be with us for a long time to come.

The other thing that's happening I think that's behind the scenes that really isn't factoring into today's headlines, but is acutely aware on the minds of many serious social media investors and even the operating officers of those companies, is, what's Congress going to do? What's the Senate going to do? Because our political leaders are understandably flummoxed. They're angry. They're angry on behalf of consumers, maybe rightly angry on behalf of other parties. I don't know. But the legal pressure facing several of these companies is substantial. And I think between the two, now you've got some serious pressure on the stocks.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: So when you look at this pressure on the stocks, and obviously, a lot of retail investors are wondering if and when they should buy the dip, how do you determine which of the companies are worth investing in when you look long-term versus some of the ones that are cheap but not necessarily good buys?

KEITH FITZ-GERALD: Oh, that's a good thing because cash is definitely not trash if you use it right. Here's the thing that I look at, you know. I want to have the best companies in their respective space. I use a phrase called best, not rest. The other thing to think about, if you're an individual investor, is, don't get caught up in the minutia. We use a phrase in our office-- when in doubt, zoom out. Because the bigger, broader picture, if you've got three, five, 10 years out, to deal with it, and you don't need your money right away, growth has slowed at numerous points in history, but it has never in the history of the world ever stopped.

So if you're sticking with the best companies, the visionary CEOs, the companies that are making progress and make our world turn, I submit three, five, 10 years out, you're going to be kicking yourself if you don't start wading in. Now, if you're doing that in a market that's going to continue to sell off, you don't have to buy in all at once. Slow your buying down. Buy a few shares every Monday, something else every Friday. Buy one share at a time if you have to. But force yourself to play offense because history shows, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that the markets have an upside bias. We may not like the downside, but that's short-term noise in the scheme of things.",2022-05-24T19:27:19+00:00
837,Is Tesla Stock a Buy Amid Second Analyst Price Target Cut?,"Daiwa Capital analyst Jairam Nathan cut his price target for Tesla (TSLA) shares on Monday. TSLA stock began to drop in pre-market trading and the slide is continuing on Tuesday with a new 2022 low close expected. The story doesn’t change for long-term growth investors — being able to buy Tesla stock at a steep discount is an opportunity. The Tesla (TSLA Stock) logo on the side of a building.

A terrible year for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders got even worse today. TSLA stock has been in a slump since early April. In fact, since April 4, shares have lost around 45% of their value.

The usual suspects have played a role in this dismal showing. Fears over inflation, rising interest rates, recession and war. In addition, as tech companies report earnings and issue disappointing guidance for coming quarters, it can be a drag on the entire sector. In the case of TSLA stock, the latest challenge is an analyst price target cut. Yesterday, Daiwa Capital analyst Jairam Nathan kept his “outperform” rating for Tesla stock, but cut 2022 earnings-per-share estimates and slashed his price target from $1,150 to $800. This is the second notable price target reduction for TSLA stock in under a week.

The reaction for many investors might be to hit pause on any potential TSLA purchases. However, with Tesla stock headed for its lowest close of 2022, now is a great time for investors focused on long-term growth to add TSLA to their portfolios.

Much of TSLA Stock’s Performance Is Due to Twitter

One of the key reasons I don’t sweat Tesla stock’s awful performance over the past six weeks is Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Recall that I pointed out earlier that TSLA’s 45% slump started on April 4. That just happens to be the day it became public news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk had been buying up TWTR stock.

That kicked off what has become an absolute circus as Elon Musk moves to buy the social media platform. The fallout over the very public saga has been the dramatic slump in TSLA stock. Among the issues Tesla investors fret about are the impact of Musk unloading Tesla shares to fund his acquisition, and the potential that the Twitter deal is distracting Musk from running Tesla. In response, Musk has tweeted that he is spending less than 5% of his time on the Twitter acquisition.

Whatever happens here, the direct impact on TSLA stock will eventually become a non-issue.

Good News From China: EV Buyers Are Shrugging Off Price Hikes

China has been the source of much bad news for Tesla in recent weeks. The Covid-19 lockdowns in Shanghai had a serious impact on the company’s EV production. However, those lockdowns — and the ripple effect of losing weeks of production — will also be short-lived.

There has been some recent good news out of China as well. Several Chinese EV makers have been reporting that despite price hikes because of rising commodity costs (especially the materials used to make batteries), demand remains strong. The Covid-19 lockdowns and price hikes have apparently not affected the ability for consumers of means in that country to buy EVs.

It is likely that Tesla will be seeing the same strong demand for its EVs in the Chinese market. The production blip (and corresponding drop in deliveries) will turn into a return to strong sales for the company.

Bottom Line: Should You Buy TSLA Stock?

Tesla stock still earns an “A” rating in Portfolio Grader. That’s a strong indictor that you can expect this stock to reward you with growth over the long term.

Keep in mind that the Daiwa Capital analysts reiterated his “outperform” rating on the stock. He’s not backing off on recommending it. Checking in with the investment analysts polled by the Wall Street Journal shows a similar pattern. The consensus rating for TSLA stock is “overweight” with an average $995.28 price target. That might not be quite as optimistic as it was a few months ago, but it’s still more than 50% upside from the current price. And despite the short-term challenges, the company is experiencing a shift back into growth.

There is no guarantee that TSLA shares won’t fall further in 2022. In fact, continued short-term turbulence is a given when you consider the challenges of Covid-19 lockdowns in China and the continuation of Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition. However, for investors willing to wait out the volatility, the long-term growth prospects for Tesla remain solid, as do the expected returns for TSLA stock.

If you follow the stock market, then you know the kind of volatility Wall Street is currently showing. Even the experts are finding it hard to make too many valid predictions. During such unstable times, investors should stick to what has worked for decades. This brings us to the idea of finding stocks to buy and hold forever. If the markets are wild, then we should to try and tame it.

The pandemic perhaps changed the short-term mindset of all traders. They have come to expect instant gratification. This is why we now have terms like a “V”-shaped recovery. The idea of buy-and-hold faded into the background — at least for now. I don’t think that we are ready to bury it, especially if we just modify it a bit.

Today’s list of stocks to buy includes nothing but “sure things.” The point is to eliminate all internal sources of variable of hiccups, leaving only extrinsic risks. This would make it nearly impossible to have a company flub cause pain to investors. I even omitted great stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) because of potential personality drama.

7 Large-Cap Stocks to Avoid Until the Market Crashes Again

I am usually very hesitant to use the word “safe” when presenting investment ideas. If there were stocks that are completely safe, they would not pay a reward. So, let this be a disclosure that we are merely discussing relative safety, which isn’t foolproof.

Story continues

Ticker Company Current Price AAPL Apple $143.11 AMZN Amazon $2,151.14 CPB Campbell Soup $46.16 INTC Intel $42 MSFT Microsoft $260.65 GOOGL Alphabet $2,072.08 JPM JPMorgan Chase $124.60

Apple (AAPL)

We cannot have a safe stocks to buy list and not include the king of stocks Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Arguably it is the best company on the planet, with special brand powers. Its clientele is amazingly loyal and price is almost never a problem. I am not a die hard fan, but I too agree it is a gem of an equity to own. Therefore, it must be part of this list of sure things.

However, I hesitate to own my entire position right away. This is only because of AAPL stock’s relative altitude to the summer 2020 levels. That’s when the markets really broke out with the tailwind from the stimulus. I expect that the bears will try to deflate more of it before it finds a true floor. I realize that it has already corrected 25% from its highs. But it is still 40% above the breakout neckline.

While this is not a reason to short it, it’s worth waiting it out a bit. Besides, there are other members of this list that have already shed this 2020 rally froth. Meanwhile, its financial metrics are beyond reproach. There isn’t a blemish on them, so don’t waste your time looking.

Amazon (AMZN)

The growth that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) accomplished in the last five years is astonishing. This is a one of a kind story that will likely never happen again. If there is one doubt about it being on the list of stocks to buy and hold is its new leader. Founder Jeff Bezos handed the reins over to a new team.

I am being paranoid, because it is likely that the Amazon machine will continue to excel regardless. The momentum it has is substantial, so it will take a lot of trepidation to die. The world is going through a rough patch coming out of the pandemic. The virus caused a human tragedy, but the policies that came out of it brought complete chaos.

7 Tech Stocks to Buy on Any Dips

Central banks are trying to slow this pendulum down, but my bet is that they will mess it up. They will overshoot and perhaps inflict near-term pain. If so, then AMZN stock nears $1,800 would be a bargain stock to buy for a long term.

Campbell Soup (CPB)

When people are sick, the old adage suggests eating soup. When the indices are on the fritz, often Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) stock offers a safe haven. Meanwhile, when the bulls are in charge it too participates with the upside to a degree. Therefore, this makes it the perfect stock to own through the proverbial thick and thin.

In addition to the relative overall calmness, CPB stock also rewards its owners with some extra cash. The 3% dividend payout is a nice source for fixed income in this low rate environment. The company’s fundamentals are as boring as they get. Perhaps this is what makes it perfect for a list of safe stocks to buy and hold forever.

For the last seven years, the profit and loss statement barely budged. Despite that, according to Yahoo Finance, its value grew. CPB still maintains a current 15x price-to-earnings ratio, which is its lowest since 2015.

Intel (INTC)

The digital revolution has never been stronger, partly because the pandemic put it in high gear. So the world will need chips to power the tech that is taking over the world. The leader in that is currently Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), even though Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are hogging the headlines. Eventually, investors will know a good thing even if it’s too late.

So far, INTC managed to stay on top for decades, and it should continue to do so for a long while. As for timing, INTC stock is at the low end of the range since 2014. I bet that there are buyers lurking from these levels and into $40 per share. Even though it could go lower, it would then become a slam dunk BUY.

7 Blue-Chip Stocks With Dividends to Buy Before June

Intel’s top line metrics don’t stack up to AMD or NVDA, but they have impressive bottom line upside. Net income has now more than doubled since 2015, without inflating the valuation proposition. The current 12 month P/E ratio is about half of then.

Microsoft (MSFT)

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is a staple on Wall Street. It rose to fame during the breakout of the digital revolution decades ago. If we include Apple in a list of stocks to buy, then we must also include MSFT. They were bitter rivals, even “frenemies” one could say.

Under the leadership of ex-CEO Steve Ballmer, the outlook was a bit murky. Satya Nadella steered that ship straight into the proper favorable tech currents. The company not only switched to a subscription service for the office suites, but it is also aiming to take a huge chunk of the cloud. Furthermore, with its recent acquisition of Activision (NASDAQ:ATVI), it can also become a gaming powerhouse.

Perhaps this would also be a gateway to the metaverse. Clearly, MSFT is doing its best to keep up with the times and stay relevant. There is no reason to doubt it now. I do caution a bit about its distance to the June 2020 breakout. At this altitude, it can easily lose another 15% before finding real support. But this is a good place to start a multiple entry point position for the long term.

Alphabet (GOOGL)

Safety often comes from size, and not many are larger than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). It is also operationally in control of so many lives, including mine. The android operating system is the most ubiquitous smart phone globally, so it has more users than anyone else.

Social media changed the world, and I bet it is here to stay. For this I struggled with picking between GOOGL and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB). I chose Alphabet because of its command of android and YouTube. Also, more recently, it announced the resurgence of wearable products. The idea of augmented reality sounds lucrative in the mid term. The company has all the tools it needs to dominate it.

The 7 Best ETFs to Buy Now if You’re Looking for Safety

Alphabet already made this transition from desktop search monster to mobile. I bet it can make another leap to whatever comes next. The proof of Alphabet’s success is obvious in its financial reports. Alphabet grew sales 2.5 times in just five years. Meanwhile, its net income grew twice as fast in the same time. These impressive accomplishments should give investors confidence that GOOGL belongs on the list of stocks to buy and hold forever.

JPMorgan (JPM)

JPMorgan’s (NYSE:JPM) management has navigated the toughest of tests since the 2008 debacle. It has emerged stronger than ever and now has a fortress balance sheet. JPM stock has strong financial reports backing up its position on this list of stocks to buy. While revenue growth isn’t great, it has grown its net income significantly. JPMorgan has earned the trust of investors, so I have no reason to doubt that it can maintain its strength.

The caveat here is that now the Federal Reserve’s actions are likely to put a serious hurt on its metrics. The tightening measures the central bank strike at the heart of JPM’s business. Therefore, I expect potential calamities during their next few quarter reports. So investors would be wise to temper the enthusiasm short term and try to get in at a lower price.

JPM stock has already lost 23% of its value this year, but it could fall half as much more from here. Buying all in now would defeat the purpose of this list. Being part of a list of stocks to buy and hold doesn’t mean we do it blindly. There are levels that are easy marks for the bears to hit.

(Reuters) - Twitter Inc will face skeptical shareholders on Wednesday during its annual meeting, as doubt remains over whether the social media company will complete its deal to be acquired by billionaire Elon Musk at the agreed-upon price.

The Tesla chief executive tweeted on May 13 that the $44 billion acquisition was ""temporarily on hold"" while he sought more information about the proportion of fake accounts on Twitter.

The company said last week it remained committed to the deal at the agreed price. However, investors have appeared unconvinced, as Twitter's shares closed on Tuesday at $35.76, representing a 34% discount to the $54.20 per share deal price.

While the virtual annual meeting will include a question and answer session on Wednesday, a Twitter spokesperson said the company will not answer deal-related questions.

Twitter investors are set to vote on five stockholder proposals, all opposed by management, which include asking the company to produce a report on its impact on civil rights and another on its lobbying activities.

The meeting itself will not be ""particularly relevant"" to the agreement to be acquired by Musk, said Donna Hitscherich, a professor of finance at Columbia Business School.

Even if shareholders approve any of the proposals, it will be non-binding, she said.

Investors in AMC (NASDAQ:AMC) are feeling the pain once again. In just the last 30 days, AMC stock has fallen by 37%. This decline is more than the roughly 8.5% loss of the S&P 500. However, to tell the truth, I’ve actually been quite surprised with the stock’s performance. This is despite the bigger decline in AMC stock relative to the benchmark index.

I had originally thought that a lot of the meme stocks would suffer catastrophic losses in a market downturn. But currently, legitimate high-growth tech stocks have just been as badly hit, or even worse. Maybe there is some value in AMC stock after all.

Bridgewater Buys AMC

A recent purchase of AMC shares by Bridgewater Associates might be a clue that there could be some value in the stock. Bridgewater Associates is headed by the legendary investor Ray Dalio.

7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now

The firm cashed out of its Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares and built a new position in AMC stock. Bridgewater purchased about 27,100 shares of the Reddit favorite stock for a position worth about $667,000.

Dalio’s approach has always been a bit contrarian and focused on macroeconomic themes. Despite being a meme stock, AMC has a theater business that is still ongoing. Now that the pandemic has subsided, people are once again starting to go see movies in theaters. This move could be seen as a hedge fund grabbing AMC shares at the cheap — especially as it has been brushed off by Wall Street as nothing but a meme stock.

AMC grows its Passive Investments

Unlike the other meme stocks, I feel that AMC’s management is making aggressive moves in order to increase the value of its stock. The company recently disclosed that it had acquired a 6.8% stake in National CineMedia (NASDAQ:NCMI). National CineMedia is in the business of showing pre-movie ads in movie theaters. This stake is meant to be a passive investment, however, as AMC wouldn’t directly influence the workings of CineMedia.

Story continues

In an interesting twist, it turns out that AMC did not actually pay for the shares, but received them for free as part of some agreement. A Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) statement by company Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron clarified that those shares were granted because the company grew its theatre count in 2021.

Regardless of how those shares are acquired, it is good to see AMC’s management being aggressive in trying to increase shareholder value.

Your Takeaway on AMC Stock

I don’t think this is the bottom just yet for AMC stock. Nor do I think Ray Dalio’s purchase is a big commitment to the future of AMC. The amount purchased, roughly $667,000, is relatively small for a hedge fund worth billions. There is a chance, though, that this could just be a starting position for Dalio and that he intends to dollar-cost average into a significant AMC stock position.

Only time will tell if that is the case. AMC is and has always been a high-risk stock. Given that it broke its latest support of $13.50, the risks are especially high that the stock could start going into a downward spiral. For investors that want to speculate a bit on AMC stock, follow Dalio and start small.

851,REFILE-U.S. automated electric truck startup Solo AVT picks battery supplier ABS,"(Changes name of company in paragraph 1 to American Battery Solutions)

By Paul Lienert

May 25 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley startup Solo Advanced Vehicle Technologies has partnered with Michigan-based American Battery Solutions (ABS) to develop battery packs for its new driverless electric heavy-duty truck, Solo AVT’s chief executive told Reuters.

“We’re focused on decarbonizing the logistics industry,” CEO and founder Graham Doorley said in an interview, adding the company is raising money to assemble its Class 8 truck, the SD1, in the United States.

Doorley, a Stanford engineering graduate, did stints at Tesla, Alphabet Inc's Google X, later Waymo, and Lockheed Martin. He will compete with former boss Elon Musk, whose well-publicized Tesla Semi still has not started production, and Swedish startup Einride, among others working on automated electric heavy haulers.

Year-old Solo AVT aims to begin testing prototypes of the SD1 in 2024, Doorley said, without specifying a date for full commercial production. A contract manufacturer will probably make the prototypes, he said, but ultimately “we want to build our own vehicles in our own factory.”

The SD1 idea took root when Doorley was working at Waymo on automating heavy trucks supplied by manufacturers PACCAR and Daimler.

Rather than retrofitting existing diesel-powered vehicles, Solo AVT is designing the SD1 from the ground up. The company has said it expects the SD1 to have a range exceeding 500 miles between charges, with fast charging capability and 600 kW of power delivered to multi-speed tandem axles with integrated electric motors.

The company has raised $7 million in seed money from Trucks Venture Capital, Maniv Mobility, Wireframe Ventures and Schox Patent Group. Doorley said he plans to launch a Series A funding round this summer.

Solo AVT is talking to potential commercial customers for the SD1, but Doorley did not provide specifics.

JARED BLIKRE: We are in the green here. And a quick check of the markets reveals that Russell 2000 leading the way. That's up about 2/3 of a percent. NASDAQ up about half a percent. And you can see, intraday, we are looking at slight gains here, so kind of a ho-hum price action day so far.

And we're seeing energy in the lead here. We were just talking to Dan Dicker about crude oil. That has been in the forefront. And also, consumer discretionary, having get absolutely whacked this year, that is up 1%. We've been talking about all the retail earnings out. And also, the tech sector, that is outperforming as well.

And we can see, in the NASDAQ 100, kind of a mixed picture in the mega caps. We do have Amazon and Tesla each up about 1%, Nvidia ahead of its earnings. We're going to be breaking that to you later on in the day after the bell. That's up about 2%. And other than that, not seeing a lot of other outliers.

INTU, Intuit, that's up about 4% as well. I want to check in on the ARK Innovation components, lots of green here as well. So disruption in play today. And we can also take a look at Chinese stocks. Those have been beaten down as we know, but those are in the green today as well.

So just kind of checking in on our leaders here, we do have KWEB. So that's a Chinese internet ETF. A lot of those components are in the green here. Retail looking up today. Ark, homebuilders, and also, IGV-- that is the software ETF. So it looks like it's a little bit risk-on today.

But I want to step back and kind of get a broader picture of the markets here. Here's the S&P 500. We were talking about this with Julie earlier in the show, but we are in a steady downtrend right now. Here's that downtrend channel. Haven't been able to even break that. So when we do, probably going to get some traders interested, maybe see another short covering rally. But Julie, what do you think of the markets here?

JULIE HYMAN: I don't know what to think of the markets there, which I guess is--

JARED BLIKRE: We're trying to weigh the scales of the market, like the scales of justice.

JULIE HYMAN: You know, I am curious what crypto is up to today, because we were so focused on that, as we were seeing, really, the meltdown there, like we were in everything else.

JARED BLIKRE: Right.

JULIE HYMAN: But like we continue to see, I assume, some kind of back and forth action there, just like we do in numerous--

JARED BLIKRE: I mean--

JULIE HYMAN: --assets.

JARED BLIKRE: --check this out. Bitcoin hovering around 30,000. I've been checking the price for several days, and it always seems to be within a few hundred dollars. Now, we can see this on a 10-day basis. Look at that. That is very choppy action right there.

And you take a look at the year to date. That's going to show that we have been consolidating. Easier to see on the candlesticks here, but each one of these is a day in. Basically, when stocks have been going down here-- and we've seen the-- we've been covering these market meltdowns every day. Bitcoin has been holding up very well. That's bullish.

When the general market has been so bearish and Bitcoin has been incredibly correlated with stocks here, to see that divergence here, probably bullish for Bitcoin, but there's also something to be said about catching down. In other words, sometimes when markets converge, it's to the downside. But right now, holding up well, and we'll have to see what comes of this.",2022-05-25T14:02:40+00:00
855,11 Best Robotics Stocks Under $10,"In this article, we discuss the 11 best robotics stocks under $10. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the robotics industry, go directly to 5 Best Robotics Stocks Under $10.

Many key industries around the globe are increasingly adopting the use of robots in manufacturing, as complex tasks can be performed in quick succession, increasing a company's output in a competitive global market. In 2020, German  automaker BMW AG signed an agreement with automation specialist KUKA to provide the automaker's factories around the globe with 5,000 robots, building on a 40-year partnership. Apart from replacing human beings in automation lines on factory floors, robots play a huge part in modern-day medical surgeries, which now utilize robotics technology to achieve unprecedented precision and results. According to a report by market research firm Mordor Intelligence, 6,000 surgical robots have already performed a million operations around the globe, in a market roughly valued at $6 billion.

BCG, a consulting firm, reported that the global robotics market is poised to rise from $25 billion in 2021 to almost $260 billion by 2030. Statista predicts that the world's robotics market could be worth more than $165 billion by 2028.  Covid-19 saw a boost in the global demand for robots used in a range of industries. Advancements in artificial intelligence and the processing power of chips has led to robots becoming more sophisticated and able to carry out complex tasks. Robots are now used for food delivery, disinfection services, as well as cleaning and janitorial services since companies are looking to reduce their expenditures on redundant operations.

According to the United Nations, one in four persons living in North America and Europe could be aged 65 years or above by 2050. The ageing population of the globe puts extra emphasis on the need to develop mobile services robots that can perform both menial and heavy tasks alike.

857,Apple Loses Former Tesla Autopilot Software Engineer to Luminar,"By Sam Boughedda

Investing.com -- Former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Autopilot software engineer Christopher ""CJ"" Moore, who joined Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) car project in 2021, has left to join Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR), a lidar company.

Moore served as director of autopilot software at Tesla, then moved to Apple as director of autonomous systems.

In a press release today it was revealed Moore will link up with Luminar to lead its software development team, aiming to advance Sentinel, Luminar’s full-stack safety and autonomous solution.

“With industry-defining technology and now nearly a dozen major commercial wins in hand, Luminar is ready for its next phase of leadership as we focus all-in on execution,” said Luminar founder and CEO, Austin Russell. “We’re attracting the best leaders in the world in their fields to execute our vision and deliver on the future of transportation.""

The news is another blow to Apple's secretive car project. In December last year, it was reported that the company lost three key engineers to start-ups, while in September last year its car project chief Doug Field left to join Ford.

Luminar stock has risen more than 8% Wednesday.

858,"S&amp;P 500 Climbs as Tech Rallies, Retailers Rebound After Fed Minutes","By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 climbed Wednesday, after swinging between gains and losses as the Federal Reserve's May meeting minutes showed the central bank was keen to move quick on rate hikes to allow breathing room on tightening later this year.

The S&P 500 rose 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1%, or 227 points, the Nasdaq was up 1.6%.

""[P]articipants judged that it was important to move expeditiously to a more neutral monetary policy stance,"" the minutes showed. Front loading rate hikes would allow the central bank breathing later this year to consider a policy readjustment later this year.

""Many participants judged that expediting the removal of policy accommodation would leave the Committee well positioned later this year to assess the effects of policy firming and the extent to which economic developments warranted policy adjustments,"" according to the minutes.

Consumer discretionary stocks were the outperforming sector as Nordstrom's quarterly results helped improve sentiment on retailers.

Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) reported a wider than expected loss in the first quarter, but revenue jumped to pre-pandemic levels to top Wall Street expectations, sending its shares more than 13% higher.

“JWN has demographics and product category skew advantages at this point in the re-open,” said Credit Suisse, but also flagged concerns about the uncertain economic backdrop of retailers in the second of half of the year.

Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) reported a softer outlook for the full year, but first-quarter results beat on both the top and bottom lines. Its shares gained 10%.

Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) also reported record sales that overshadowed weaker-than-expected earnings and the impact of rising costs. Wall Street also pointed to strength in the retailer’s Anthropologie and Free People Movement brands.

“Despite the miss…sales at Anthro and FP Movement continue to perform well due to demand for apparel, dresses, and fashion,” B. Riley said in a note. “We continue to believe that URBN has upside as Anthro is seeing a recovery as consumers look for fashion and occassionwear.”

Bath&Body Works (NYSE:BBWI), Under Armour (NYSE:UAA), and Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) were among the biggest gainers, while a climb in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also supported the sector.

Housing stocks, led by Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), were also in ascendency, shrugging off recent data pointing to a slowdown in the housing market.

Toll Brothers reported better-than-expected quarterly results, buoyed by strong demand for housing, though the home builder highlighted the impact of rising mortgage rates and softer macroeconomic conditions.

Lennar (NYSE:LEN), PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM), and TRI Pointe Homes (NYSE:TPH) were higher.

Technology, meanwhile, cut some losses as big tech including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) moved off session lows.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was up more than 5% ahead of its quarterly results due after the market closes.

In other news, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) jumped more than 13% after the meatless company announced an endorsement deal with influencer Kim Kardashian.

Moore, who had joined Apple in August, will lead Luminar’s software team to develop autonomous safety features integrated with its lidar, or laser sensors, the auto-parts company said in a statement Wednesday. Luminar shares jumped as much as 8.2% and were trading up 4.8% at 12:09 p.m. in New York.

The departure from Apple continues a string of high-profile changes to its car project. Over the last two years, nearly the entire Apple Car management team has left. Earlier this month, Ian Goodfellow, another director on the Apple project, left for Alphabet Inc.’s DeepMind. At the same time, Apple has hired new managers from Ford, Rivian and other car industry players.

Orlando, Florida-based Luminar, which went public via a $3.4 billion reverse merger in 2020, has signed agreements with Mercedes-Benz, Volvo Car AB, and SAIC Motor Corp. to provide laser sensors to enable semi-autonomous driving in passenger cars.

Luminar also said it hired Taner Ozcelik, a veteran of Nvidia Corp.’s automotive business, to lead product development.

Apple shares declined less than 1%.

862,"Tesla stock down 47% from high amid supply woes, risk-off environment","Tesla (TSLA) shares are getting a brief reprieve today, but that’s little consolation for investors who are down big since Tesla’s recent highs hit back in November.

At the time of this writing, Tesla shares are down over 47% from itheir all-time high of $1243.49. The EV-maker has been underperforming other growth tech names since CEO Elon Musk began his quest to purchase Twitter, potentially using his massive holdings of Tesla shares as collateral.

That’s just the beginning of Tesla’s woes this year. Since then, there have been the COVID-19 shutdowns in Shanghai affecting its production in China, general parts and component shortages affecting the auto industry at large, and recent accusations of sexual misconduct leveled on Elon Musk.

Also, on the institutional front, Tesla bull Cathie Wood of ARK Invest trimmed her holdings of the stock in its flagship ARK Innovation Fund, as the value of those shares have shrunk in half since the beginning of the year. And adding further to Tesla’s pain, S&P removed Tesla from its S&P 500 ESG index, citing Tesla’s lack of an explicit low carbon strategy, “claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions” at its Fremont factory, and the company’s behavior around the ongoing NHTSA investigation of the “multiple deaths and injuries” linked to Full Self Driving and Autopilot features.

Musk’s quest to buy Twitter and his recent hesitance to consummate the deal, has Wall Street analysts concerned about what it means to Tesla at this critical time. In a note to clients this week, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said the Twittter “circus show has been a major overhang on Tesla's stock,” and as it drags on, could lead to more weakness as “investor patience is wearing very thin.”

In addition, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi warned in a note that if Tesla’s stock were to keep falling, it could force Musk to sell even more shares to fund his Twitter buy because of a margin loan tied to Musk’s Tesla stock.

Story continues

“If the TWTR deal were to close today and subsequently TSLA's stock price dropped to $350-400, Musk could be forced to sell ~13M Tesla shares,” Sacconaghi said. SHANGHAI, CHINA - MAY 15: A total of 4,027 Tesla Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles, which will be sent to the Port of Zeebrugge in Belgium, wait to be loaded on board the roll-on-roll-off cargo vessel Theben operated by Wallenius Wilhelmsen at Nangang port on May 15, 2022 in Shanghai, China. (Photo by Shen Chunchen/VCG via Getty Images)

The prospect of Musk unloading another 13 million shares of Tesla would likely not be good for its stock price in the near term.

That being said, looking at the bigger picture that is the electric vehicle (EV) market, Tesla is still in the driver’s seat when it comes to EV brand awareness, consumer sentiment, and sales performance. Recent data from Experian shows how as EV sales spiked in the U.S. in the last quarter, a whopping 70% of the total EV market was accounted by Tesla, with the Model Y, Model 3, and Model S leading the pack.

Last quarter, Tesla sales performance hit another all-time high, even with the component and chip shortages plaguing the industry. And speaking about demand, currently the wait to receive a base Model Y long range SUV ordered on the Tesla website is showing a delivery window of November 2022 - February 2023.

And despite its recent troubles, Tesla shares are still up over 800% since the pandemic lows of early March 2020.

By John Jannarone and Jarrett Banks

Green energy is undoubtedly the future. The challenge for investors: Identifying companies that can manage temporary market challenges and remain financially strong.

One such company that stands out is Altus Power, Inc. (ticker: AMPS), a solar-power provider that recently issued its second quarterly results (first quarter of 2022) as a public company and reaffirmed profit guidance. Altus has a unique model among public companies where it installs solar modules on places such as rooftops without an upfront charge to the customer, then profitably sells the customer power at rates below the utility grid price.

But while the Altus model has many advantages for the long term, there have recently been unexpected challenges – most of which Altus can navigate until they subside over time. Savvy investors who understand the short-term dynamic may discover an opportunity in Altus shares, which are down about 30% so far this year.

One obvious challenge that has impacted many companies is the rising cost of debt. With the 10-year yield effectively tripling from 1% to 3% in a period of months, negotiations have taken longer than usual on Altus’s asset backed debt used to fund new projects. But that volatility should ease soon and it’s worth noting that Co-CEOs Gregg Felton and Lars Norell have extensive fixed-income backgrounds from senior roles at top-tier Wall Street investment banks.

Second, there has been a bottleneck in the supply of solar modules, many of which come from Southeast Asia. The U.S. government is reviewing whether certain market participants circumvented rules by selling China-sourced modules through other countries like Vietnam. That has created a delay in deliveries that could last for months.

But Altus is positioned to manage the supply-chain trouble better than most. The company said on its quarterly investor call that it has adequate supplies secured to last through early 2023. And compared with major utilities that need massive amounts of modules, Altus has relatively modest needs. It also has better margins than those utilities because it sells power on a retail basis, giving it room to absorb some costs if needed.

Altus also should have room to pass costs onto consumers thanks to surging utility rates. With natural gas prices skyrocketing, traditional grid power prices likely will continue to increase in months ahead. That’s good news for Altus because 60% of its current portfolio is variable rate and all of its power is cheaper than the grid. In turn, it can ratchet prices higher but still offer customers advantageous terms.

It’s also important to remember that Altus has a steady flow of new potential customers thanks to its partnerships with Blackstone and CBRE. Blackstone was an early investor in the company and CBRE is tied to the SPAC that took Altus public. The combined partners have ties to billions of square feet of real estate and all indications suggest the partnership is working out as planned – or even better. On the recent investor call, Altus said it’s now offering solutions to more and larger prospective customers than it did before going public.

What’s more, sustainability is becoming a concern for more commercial and industrial property owners. Deals with big partners such as Dallas-based developer Trammell Crow Co., which will cover 35 million square feet of industrial space, provide a chance for Altus to scale quickly and establish a significant presence in key markets where more business may follow.

Altus will install solar panels on Trammell properties and make further investments in battery-storage capacity, electric-vehicle charging stations and other environmentally friendly technologies.  By 2026, Altus expects to install 300 megawatts of solar-generating capacity at industrial properties being developed by Trammell.

Trammell will collect rent from Altus for housing its solar panels, which will be installed on the roofs of industrial properties in 19 markets. The project will help Trammell reduce its reliance on the power grid and help the landlord attract tenants and investors who increasingly want buildings with low carbon footprints.

Deals such as the Trammell agreement create an additional marketing effect. Altus said on its investor call that it’s seeing signs of growing brand recognition as prospective customers have seen public announcements and contacted the company directly.

Another important growth area is community solar. There are plenty of customers, over 5,000, who live in residential areas and purchase solar power from Altus that’s generated on solar panels in locations such as Trammell’s commercial properties. That power is then sent to residential customers – both in single and multifamily homes. The power is cheaper than a solar panel installed on a house and of course many multifamily units don’t have sufficient room for their own panels.

Community solar also has social benefits that should appeal to ESG-focused investors. In some cases, Altus sends power to affordable housing in underserved communities, mollifying inflationary strains on budget-conscious families.

Right now, about 11% of Altus’s power is directed to community solar but that could increase quickly. Governments in eight of the 18 states in the Altus footprint allow the practice and the remaining 10 could soon give the green light, creating much more demand for Altus to meet.

Even before considering new projects, Altus is a cash-generating machine. The existing portfolio is funded with fixed rate debt and continues to generate healthy Ebitda – as the company has done since 2017. That means investors can look forward to continued positive cash flow even if the current delays drag on for a while.

Thanks to Altus’s profitable operating model, its balance sheet has remained strong. Net debt is roughly flat from the end of the fourth quarter and unrestricted cash stands at a healthy $318.2 million.

Investors keen to invest in Altus can do so now at a reasonable price. The shares trade at an implied enterprise value of 11.9 times 2023 consensus Ebitda, according to Sentieo, an AI-enabled research platform.

The green energy sector has seen many companies go public recently with high hopes to capitalize on the systemic shift in how we power our homes, drive cars and more. But many of them are also burning cash with no obvious ways to replenish it. While there may be some challenges left to overcome, Altus has plenty of fuel to make its vision a reality.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

DAVE BRIGGS: The S&P 500 on-pace for its worst initial 100 days since 1970. How are ETFs faring amidst the carnage? And how is investor behavior changing amidst all that? Dave Nadig is a VettaFi financial futurist. He joins us as part of our ETF Report brought to you by Invesco QQQ. Nice to see you, sir.

The NASDAQ has popped today. It's nice to see an up day, up about 2%, but down 27% year to date. How is it impacting ETFs in general?

DAVID NADIG: Well, in general, ETFs as an asset class, as a structure have held up wonderfully. I think it's inevitable that when we have downturns like this however, investors look to change things in their portfolio.

We spend a lot of time talking to financial advisors at VettaFi. We did a poll just last week, asking financial advisors how they were adjusting their client portfolios. And surprisingly, over half of them said they were looking to get into alternative asset classes, something other than just more stocks, more bonds, or just looking to go to cash.

51% said they were looking to move into an alternative asset class, which frankly, we found surprising.

SEANA SMITH: Dave, any idea just in terms of, within that alternative asset class, where they're finding opportunity right now?

DAVID NADIG: Well, there have been a couple of different approaches there. One thing that we've heard a lot of advisors getting excited about is this idea of return stacking. This is something that really was sort of brought to light by a newfound guy named Cary Hochstein and the folks over at Resolve Asset Management.

And the idea is to use something to give you a little bit more room in your portfolio so that your diversification can really matter. The ETF that a lot of folks are using for this is the WisdomTree capital efficiency ETF NTSX. It's effectively a 90-60 portfolio, 90% stocks, 60% treasuries, using futures to give you a little bit of leverage, not to take more risk, but actually to create room in your portfolio to put a little bit less into that 60-40 so you can open yourself up for true alternatives.

Story continues

On that alt space, the commodities have really been the go-to. We've seen a lot of flows on a lot of interest in particular in Invesco's Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity ETF, which is PDBC. It's up about 35% this year. And that's really been a core allocation.

Another thing we've been looking at that's really interesting is a managed futures approach, an actively managed approach that can look at things like going short the yen or short the euro through futures. The fund there is DBMF, the IMGP DBI Managed Futures ETF. It's up about 21% this year.

Both are going to give you non-correlated returns, and that's really the most important thing when you're building for a long-term portfolio.

DAVE BRIGGS: Dave, you referenced there the 60-40 rule, which appears to be no longer, in most cases. Younger workers, according to recent research, portfolios are now up to 92% stocks, while mid-career workers saw the biggest jump. And it was a huge, one from 69% to 82% stocks. What is your takeaway from that? And is the 60-40 rule just no longer?

DAVID NADIG: Well, I think it's been an era of, there's no alternative. For the last decade, you really kind of wanted to be in-- or at least the last couple of years, you really wanted to be in equities. There weren't a lot of places to get even yield. Just dividend strategies have been the primary yield vector for folks. So I understand how we got there.

I think over the longer term though, what we're seeing is that folks are going to come back to a more diversified approach, whether or not 40% is the right bond allocation. It's been very clear in this last quarter that having some bond allocation really can work for you. And as we start going into a rising rate environment, it actually makes sense to start legging in as those higher coupon rates become available.

So I don't think we're going to be running back to a 1970s-style 60-40 portfolio anytime soon. But the idea of getting that extra diversification, I think a lot of investors are learning that lesson the hard way right now.

SEANA SMITH: Dave, what do you make of the cash piles? Because Bank of America was out with a recent survey saying that the cash piles right now are at levels we haven't seen since 2001. Is that true with what you're seeing as well? And when is the best time to put some of that money to work?

DAVID NADIG: Well, I think it's a terrible idea to try to call the bottom or the top in any market. That never works. I think the right approach, if you do have a cash pile, as you put it, money sitting on the sidelines as Wall Street always says, the thing is to get that to work on a consistent basis. Don't wait for a single entry point. You'll always be wrong.

Human beings are terrible market timers whether they sit on Wall Street or they sit on Main Street. Get that money to work over time, whether you're doing it through your 401K or whether you're legging in as the market's going down. It's the best time to be a buyer.

DAVE BRIGGS: Gotta get you to weigh in on the latest with Elon. As you know, called the S&P's ESG index a scam and called it a lot of other things that we can't say on television after Tesla was given the boot from their index. What does it mean for Tesla? And what does it mean for the index moving forward?

DAVID NADIG: Well, I think it's important to remember that ESG has three letters in it, not just one. And I think his concern was, well, we're getting booted out, and we're supposed to be this environmentally go-forward company that's going to change our electric grid. I think that may all be true, but there's also an S and a G.

And the social part has to do with how you're treating your employees. And the governance part often has to do with how well you're managing your company, what your regulatory environment is, what your lawsuit situation looks like. All of those things have been going the own way for Tesla for months.

And so to get kicked out of an ESG ETF makes a lot of sense, to get kicked out of purely a net-zero impact ETF focused only on the environment, maybe he'd have a point. But ESG funds are not one-size-fits-all. You've got to look under the hood.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Dave Nadig, VettaFi Financials futurist. And thanks so much for joining us.",2022-05-25T20:04:09+00:00
871,The Trouble With Lithium,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk wants to mine it, China is scouring Tibet for it, battery makers are crying out for it. Lithium, the wonder metal at the heart of the global shift to electric cars, is in a full-blown crisis. Demand has outstripped supply, pushing prices up almost 500% in a year and hindering the world’s most successful effort yet to halt global warming.

The shortage of lithium is so acute that in China, which makes about 80% of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, the government corralled suppliers and manufacturers to demand “a rational return” to lower prices. Analysts at Macquarie Group Ltd. warned of a “a perpetual deficit,” while Citigroup Inc. nearly doubled its price forecast for 2022, saying an “extreme” rally could be coming.

The consequences of failure to produce enough lithium are potentially devastating. Global investment in EVs has grown faster than any other new-energy sector over the past few years, outstripping even wind and solar power. Current lithium spot prices could add up to $1,000 to the cost of a new vehicle, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said. Along with higher prices of other raw materials, that is reversing years of falling prices as EVs race to become cost-competitive with gasoline-powered cars. If battery makers can’t get enough lithium, it would curb the expansion of clean-energy vehicles, making it harder to meet global emissions targets.

“It looks like the expansion ramp up is not going to be fast enough to hit demand” over the next three years, said Cameron Perks, an analyst at Benchmark. EV makers “have been asleep at the wheel.”

The crunch prompted a characteristically blunt tweet from Musk in April. “Price of lithium has gone to insane levels!” he posted on Twitter. “Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.”

Musk’s Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers BYD Co., Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. have all already raised sticker prices, as has Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s biggest EV battery maker. “The industry is facing very strong headwinds in terms of cost escalation,” XPeng President Brian Gu told Bloomberg TV in late March.

The silvery-white metal, the third-lightest element after hydrogen and helium, is in the throes of an unprecedented boom because a slump in 2018-2020 that halved its value caused chronic underinvestment in new sources of supply just as EV demand was taking off. For battery makers, those woes have been compounded by the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine, which have snarled supplies of other ingredients they need, including nickel, graphite and cobalt.

Tightening supply and higher prices have prompted a flurry of acquisitions and joint ventures as battery makers and automakers try to secure supplies, and unleashed a wave of resource nationalism among governments. As early as last June, Fitch Solutions said lithium had become a “strategic mineral,” and warned of “rising government intervention.”

EVs and batteries drew $271 billion and $7.9 billion of investment respectively in 2021, according to Kwasi Ampofo, head of metals and mining at BloombergNEF. “The upstream part of the value chain has, on the other hand, attracted relatively low investment over the last five years,” he said.

Read: How Hot Is Lithium? A Chinese Mine Auction Draws 3,448 BidsLithium has taken a long time to hit the mainstream. Discovered in 1817 by Swedish chemist Johan August Arfwedson, it wasn’t produced in quantity until the US government began stockpiling it to make hydrogen bombs in the late 1950s. After the Cold War, production declined until the metal began to be adopted for use in light alloys, coin cells and then mobile phone batteries in the 1990s.

More than half of the global resources are located in the so-called lithium triangle between Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, where producers pump lithium-rich brine from underground lakes and allow the liquid to evaporate for 12-28 months to yield a slurry that can be profitably processed. Current technology recovers only about 50% of the lithium in the brine.

Much of the remaining supply comes from deposits of an igneous rock called spodumene, with Australia the biggest miner. The ore is roasted and leached with sulfuric acid and the silvery-gray residue typically shipped to China to be made into lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate – compounds that can be combined with nickel or cobalt to make battery electrodes, or with solvents to make electrolytes.

The quickest way to increase supply is to ramp up output from these existing sources. Ganfeng Lithium Co., one of the world’s largest producers, said it’ll use record profits to boost output. Australia’s Pilbara Minerals Ltd. aims to raise production capacity more than 50% by the September quarter by expanding its Pilgangoora mine in Western Australia, a project that includes Chinese partners Great Wall Motor Co. and CATL.

For many brine-lithium producers, increasing output quickly is constrained by their permits and the time taken to let the liquid evaporate.

One longer-term solution is to find new deposits.

Mining superpowers Australia and Canada has both promised to help develop critical mineral resources, including lithium. China recently announced that its geologists had discovered a spodumene deposit on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in the region of Mount Everest that could hold more than 1 million tons of lithium oxide. But it takes years to develop a new mine and, in some countries, the process is becoming more difficult due to resistance from local communities.

“There is plenty of lithium in the ground, but timely investment is the issue,” said Joe Lowry, founder of advisory firm Global Lithium. “Tesla can build a gigafactory in about two years, cathode plants can be built in less time, but it can take up to 10 years to build a greenfield lithium brine project.”

Rio Tinto Group’s proposed $2.4 billion Jadar mine on farmland in western Serbia, which would be Europe’s biggest, stalled as thousands of protesters marched in the streets. Rio says the mine, originally scheduled to open in 2026, would create more than 2,000 jobs and meet the highest environmental standards, including using recycled water and electric trucks. Savannah Resources’ Barroso project in Portugal and Lithium Americas Corp.’s proposed mine in Nevada are others that have to negotiate local opposition.

Chile’s Constitutional Convention this month approved an expansion of environmental governance that includes reshaping water rules and other environmental protections that could affect lithium producers if the charter is ratified in a September referendum. “If you're a multinational company going in to Chile right now, you have to think twice, because you don't know what the rules are,” Lowry said.

But lithium producers face an even bigger problem. Part of the reason consumers are prepared to pay a premium for an electric vehicle is that it’s better for the environment. But the lithium supply chain is far from green.

“Lithium mineral producers have the greatest need to reduce their emissions profiles,"" said Dominic Wells, senior sustainability and cost analyst at Wood Mackenzie Ltd.

Environmental Cost

The Atacama desert of northern Chile is one of the driest places on Earth, but extracting the mineral from salt flats 10 times the size of New York’s Central Park and processing it requires a lot of water. According to BloombergNEF, it can take about 70,000 liters of water to make one ton of lithium. Mining spodumene is energy intensive and together with shipping the concentrate to China for refining can emit 3.5 times more carbon dioxide than lithium extracted from brine, according to Wood Mackenzie.

“There’s a lot of dirty things happening in producing these materials,” said Steven Vassiloudis, chief executive officer of Novalith, which is working on a system that would streamline processing of spodumene and absorb carbon. “Hard-rock lithium has such a high carbon footprint because of the energy requirement” and the many steps needed in conventional processing.

Automakers are wading in to protect the “green” image of their electric cars. BMW and a group backed by German automobile giants including Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG and have begun separate investigations into water use and production methods in the South American salt flats.

Companies are pursuing new technologies to lower expenses, cut water use and green their operations. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle Corp., the world’s biggest lithium producer, is seeking responsible mining certification for its operations in Chile and said it will reduce the intensity of freshwater use by 25% by 2030 in areas of high water risk.

“Producing lithium to use as little electricity and water is a critical goal,” said Ken Hoffman, senior expert at McKinsey & Co. “Coming up with one or several of these novel ways to produce ‘green lithium’ will be vital to the long term success of this industry. Whomever is able to deliver this technology, they should see very strong returns.”

That prize has spawned a raft of startups. Many are pursuing direct lithium extraction, a term used to describe ways to chemically capture lithium compounds that would speed up production.

""DLE can massively increase supply,” said Hoffman at McKinsey who estimates the technology could come online as soon as late next year. “You don't need two years of drying lithium out from brine. And instead of getting about 40% of lithium out of the brine, you can get more than double the amount.""

If they succeed, it will still take time to catch up with demand.

""Even if DLE happens, we are still far behind the car companies’ EV plans for at least a decade,” Lowry said. “DLE has to be customized. It's not a one-size-fits-all technology.”

Albemarle, which carries out its own research, said DLE so far has shown to be “typically less economic and less sustainable than conventional brine resources.” The company said it continues to investigate DLE and other processes to meet sustainability goals.

Alternative Batteries

The environmental and supply issues have prompted companies to look for alternatives to the lithium-ion battery, including hydrogen. But none have come close to supplanting lithium in the all-important passenger car market, and most are years away from commercial viability.

“Lithium-ion will remain the dominant battery technology, at least up to 2035,” said BloombergNEF’s Ampofo. “Automakers will potentially have to become miners to help develop and scale up some of these next generation lithium extraction technologies.""

Lithium-ion batteries fall into a sweet spot that balances high energy density and safety. The mineral is the least-dense solid element with the greatest electro-chemical potential and a very low melting point, producing an excellent energy-to-weight performance.

Ulderico Ulissi, battery research lead at London-based Rho Motion Ltd., an energy transition researcher, predicts that solid-state and sodium-ion batteries could eventually challenge lithium-ion packs in some applications in the second half of the decade. “EV qualification, however, is a lengthy process and scaling up manufacturing of new technologies can bring several challenges.”

Recycled Cells

Another potential source of lithium is from recycling old batteries, a practice that could meet 16% of annual demand by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. But battery retirements are only set to surge after 2030. “Basically, there's just not enough batteries to be recycled right now,"" said McKinsey’s Hoffman, adding that recycling presents its own environmental problems. ""There is no great way to recycle a battery today.”

One roadblock to investing in output is that not everyone is convinced that the market will remain undersupplied and miners don’t want to be burned again by the kind of glut that caused prices to slump in 2018.

The upshot is that the lithium crunch isn’t likely to go away soon, leaving an industry that exists because of the need to protect the environment with little option but to ramp up output as fast as possible, even with a supply chain that spews emissions and guzzles scarce resources.

“Yes, it helps to be green,” said Perks at Benchmark. “But right now, we need all the lithium we can get.”

In a recent report, Bloomberg Economics claimed that the United States Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth would be around 2.8% in 2022, above 0.8% compared to the 2% GDP growth forecast for China, the main economic rival of the US. Per the authors of the report, this would be the first time in more than three decades that the GDP growth of the US is higher than China. The report underlined the impact of increasing COVID restrictions in China as one of the main reasons behind this forecast.

The administration of US President Biden is using the report to highlight the success of the economic policies of the government, especially as rising inflation numbers and the threats of more rate hikes this year bring the economy closer to a recession. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted about the report on May 20, stressing that the best way to tackle inflation while competing with the rest of the world was to “respect the independence of the Fed, lower costs and lower the deficit”.

The US economy is dangerously close to a recession as all benchmark indexes are down year-to-date. The S&P 500 Index is down over 17.88% year-to-date, the NASDAQ Composite is down nearly 28%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by 13%. The turmoil has resulted in a mass selloff in the market, lowering the valutions of prominent stocks with strong business models like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) markets automotive replacement parts and accessories. Supply chain problems and inflation have hit auto firms in the past few months, presenting both challenges and opportunities.

The return of pre-pandemic commuting and travel trends has also helped the stock in recent weeks.

On May 13, Citi analyst Steven Zaccone maintained a Buy rating on AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) stock and raised the price target to $2,250 from $2,210, while acknowledging the recession risk at large retailers.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58

Decrease in Share Price Over Past Month: 4.04%

Musk will provide an additional $6.25 billion in equity financing for the $44 billion buyout, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. That’s enough to eliminate the margin loan of the same size, which had already been reduced earlier this month.

The new structure could reduce the risk of the deal for both Musk and his lenders, particularly given the recent slide in Tesla’s stock price. The electric carmaker has sunk about 40% since Musk first announced his stake in Twitter in early April. An extended slump raised the prospect that he wouldn’t have enough unpledged shares to cover the margin loan.

Musk, Tesla’s co-founder, is still on the hook for coming up with the full $33.5 billion equity component. But he can turn to others for help.

Musk is seeking additional financing commitments, including having discussions with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and other investors about rolling their equity into the private company, according to the latest filing. He already announced earlier this month that he secured $7.1 billion of equity commitments from investors including billionaire Larry Ellison, Sequoia Capital and Binance.

Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Musk had received commitments for another $1 billion in equity since that initial round, and his advisers were soliciting interest from potential investors for as much as $6 billion in preferred equity financing.

Musk, 50, is the world’s richest person, with a personal fortune of $200 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That’s largely due to his stake in Tesla.

Story continues

Musk already disposed of $8.5 billion of Tesla shares to help raise cash for his Twitter deal, tweeting at the time that he had no further sales planned.

Twitter closed Wednesday at $37.16, well below Musk’s offering price of $54.20. The shares were up 6.8% in after-hours trading at 4:58 p.m. in New York, while Tesla slid 1.4%.

Welcome to Episode #315 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.

Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.

This week, Tracey is joined by Zacks Senior Stock Strategist, Kevin Cook, to talk about 2022’s market sell-off and what investors should do.

Do You Have a Plan?

Kevin and Tracey have always been about having a “plan.” One way to control your emotions is to have trailing stops on your big winners which automatically sell, and locks in the gains, on a big stock sell off.

Your trailing stop could be 25%, 20% or 15%. You could go with whatever you are comfortable with.

But what if you didn’t have a plan and now you are sitting on a portfolio that has seen big declines?

Should investors dollar cost average like ARK Investment’s Cathie Wood is doing?

What about owning the “hot” sectors like energy? Is it too late to buy?

5 Popular Stocks: What to do now?

1. Target TGT

Target was an investor favorite during the pandemic as it seemed like the company was doing everything right. But a cut in earnings guidance this year has pushed Target shares down 33% in 2022. Target shares now trade in “value” territory with a forward P/E of 13.5. It also pays a dividend, yielding 2.4%. Is Target oversold?

2. Block SQ

Block shares have taken a beating in 2022, falling 52%. But earnings are also expected to fall 42% in 2022. The Zacks Consensus is looking for $0.92 when Block made $1.71 last year. Sales are expected to rise just 1.9% in 2022. Is Block a deal after the sell off or is there still more downside to come?

Story continues

3. Shopify SHOP

Shopify has been one of Kevin’s favorite stocks. Shares are down 75.8% year-to-date. Shopify missed big on earnings in the first quarter, however, and earnings are expected to fall 52.4% in 2022. If you liked it at $1700, should you buy Shopify at $325?

4. Tesla TSLA

Tesla was also a big pandemic winner but shares are down 37.3% in 2022. It still trades with a forward P/E of 56 but Tesla investors have never cared about valuation. Sales are expected to rise 60.1% in 2022 and earnings look equally bullish, up 64.9%. Is this a buying opportunity in a popular growth name like Tesla?

5. Pioneer Natural Resources PXD

Pioneer Natural Resources is one of the big oil and natural gas companies in the Permian Basin. It’s the only stock on this list which is up in 2022, gaining 52.8% and trading near 52-week highs. Pioneer Natural Resources shares are still cheap, with a forward P/E of only 8, because earnings are expected to rise 152.7% to $33.51 from $13.26 last year. It’s paying a standard and variable dividend. Is it too late to get into energy and Pioneer Natural Resources?

877,INSIGHT-Global automakers face electric shock in China,"By Norihiko Shirouzu

BEIJING, May 26 (Reuters) - If global automakers think they can extend their dominance in China into the electric era, they may be in for a shock.

Kings of the combustion age such as General Motors and Volkswagen are falling behind local players in the booming electric vehicle (EV) market in China, a country that's key to funding and developing their electric and autonomous ambitions.

For Beijing office worker Tianna Cheng, the main dilemma when she was buying a 180,000-yuan ($27,000) Xpeng electric crossover was whether she should go for a BYD car instead, or a Nio; she did not seriously consider overseas marques.

""If I was buying a gasoline car, I may have considered foreign brands,"" the 29-year-old said as she drove home from work. ""But I wanted an EV, and other than Tesla, I saw few foreign brands applying advanced smart technology properly.""

Buoyed by demand from consumers like Cheng, electric car sales are rocketing in China's roughly $500 billion auto market, the world's biggest.

In the first four months of 2022, the number of new energy passenger cars - pure EVs and plug-in hybrids - more than doubled from a year earlier to 1.49 million cars, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

The cleaner technologies accounted for 23% of China's passenger car market, where overall vehicle sales fell 12%, reflecting a steep decline in demand for gasoline cars.

There are no foreign brands among the top 10 automakers in the new energy vehicle (NEV) segment this year, with the notable exception of U.S. electric pioneer Tesla in third place, according to China Passenger Car Association data.

All the rest are Chinese brands, from BYD and Wuling to Chery and Xpeng. China leader BYD has sold about 390,000 EVs in the country this year, more than three times as many as global leader Tesla sold there. The top-ranked traditional carmaker is Volkswagen's venture with FAW Group, in 15th place for EV sales.

Story continues

Cheng said that overseas marques, whether the Buick Velite 7 or Volkswagen's ID. series, failed to provide what she was looking for: an EV capable of giving her the ""comfort"" of having a smartphone-like experience in her vehicle.

""Foreign brands are so far from my life and lifestyle,"" said Cheng, whose digital assistant handles connections to apps like Alipay and Taobao and ""does everything for me from opening the windows to turning on music"", while her car software provides over-the-air updates.

It's quite a reversal. Global brands have dominated in China since the 1990s, typically winning a collective 60-70% share of passenger car sales in recent years. In the first four months of 2022 they captured 52%, with their April monthly share at 43%.

Signalling the scale of the challenge facing traditional automakers, Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida told Reuters that some brands ""could disappear in three to five years"" in China.

""Local brands are becoming stronger,"" said Uchida, who was formerly Nissan's China chief, adding that the quality of EVs from Chinese makers had improved rapidly, with advances being made in the space of months.

""There will be a lot of transformation in China and we need to carefully watch the situation,"" said the CEO, adding that carmakers had to be nimble in the design, development and launch of new models.

""In those aspects, if we were slow, we would be left behind.""

'HI-TECH NATIVES'

Bill Russo, a former Chrysler executive who now heads Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility, said global brands need to turn the situation around quickly because they controlled less than 20% of China's only growth auto market.

""Chinese brands are wining the race to EV,"" said Russo, adding that consumers' shift to cars that are essentially smartphones on four wheels appeared irreversible and that traditional carmakers were having trouble keeping up.

""I think it's a secular shift toward hi-tech,"" he said of the consumer demand for a ""user-centric digital services experience"" with a focus on interface, connectivity and apps.

""Traditional companies are not hi-tech natives.""

Volkswagen Group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini, Porsche and Skoda, have led the market for much of the past two decades, alongside General Motors marques such as Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac.

The two global groups had overall auto market shares of almost 13% and 12% respectively in China last year, according to LMC Automotive. Detroit giant GM also has a 44% stake in the locally controlled SAIC-GM-Wuling Auto (SGMW) venture, and includes its sales in group numbers, though SGMW does not make American brands, only Wuling and Baojun cars.

GM is now focused on winning over younger buyers in big cities that have hitherto largely snubbed its models according to two people familiar with the automaker's business in China.

The group has announced electrification plans to spend more than $35 billion globally by 2025, including more than 30 new EVs, over 20 of them in China, starting this year with the launch of the all-electric Cadillac Lyriq crossover SUV.

The two sources said the Lyriq launch would be followed by an electric Buick SUV and a smaller, sportier electric crossover, both also planned for as early as this year.

Sales of Buicks have declined 32% over the last five years to 828,600 vehicles in 2021, while Chevrolet has shrunk more than half to 269,000 vehicles, according to LMC Automotive.

GM told Reuters it was aiming to install capacity to produce 1 million EVs a year by 2025 in China, adding that demand for the Buick Velite NEV family and Chevrolet Menlo EV ""both grew significantly"" in 2021 and the first three months of this year.

It said it was deploying smart technologies including hands-free driver assistance on highways, ""aviation-grade"" cyber security and over-the-air software updates.

AUTOBAHN SPEED?

Volkswagen, which is spending around $55 billion globally on EVs by 2026, launched its new-generation of ID. series in China early last year but missed its goal of selling 80,000 to 100,000 cars last year. It aims to sell 160,000 to 200,000 ID. cars this year, though it has sold only 33,300 through April.

A key concern for foreign brands, according to one of the people close to GM plus a Volkswagen insider, is that their new EVs are being designed more for American and European markets in mind, with a heavier focus on performance and durability.

""Autobahn speeds? In most big cities in China traffic is so congested people can't even drive above 60 km/h on most days,"" said the source close to GM, who is familiar with the automaker's product plans and product-development processes.

Volkswagen said NEV demand in China was strongly linked to the ""smart car"" theme, adding that it was investing in local R&D, especially in software.

""Our strategy will enable us to achieve our ambitious targets in China. By 2030, we also want to be the market leader in e-vehicles and thus ensure that Volkswagen remains the number one in China in the future,"" it added.

The challenge for global brands is to find the formula to win over consumers in big cities with disposable incomes, like Cheng in Beijing and Li Huayuan, a civil engineer from Shanghai.

Li only half-heartedly considered Japanese and German brands when he bought his BYD electric sedan last year for 290,000 yuan including insurance.

""Seems to me only Tesla stands out when it comes to American brands,"" he said from his parked BYD car in the Sichuan provincial city of Mianyang where he's working on a project. ""The other brands don't even look competitive to me.""

880,"U.S. Stocks Climb, on Track for a Weekly Gain","By Liz Moyer

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks rose on Thursday as investors tried to sustain a rally while they digested the latest information from the Federal Reserve.

At 10:48 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 452 points or 1.4%, while the S&P 500 rose 1.6% and the NASDAQ Composite rose 1.9%.

Minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting in early May indicated the central bank could slow the pace of its interest rate increases later this year if inflation trends lower and the labor market shows less of a demand-supply imbalance. That cheered investors and has sent stocks higher.

Shares of department store operator Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) jumped 15% after it raised its full-year profit forecast, helped by strong demand for apparel from consumers returning to work and social events.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose 1% after a report by Bloomberg that the company expects not to increase production of its iPhones this year because of disruptions in China linked to lockdowns.

Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) shares climbed 5.4% after a filing showed that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk lifted his personal commitment in buying the social media platform by $6.25 billion to $33.5 billion and was also in talks with shareholders for additional financing commitments to fund the deal.

McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shares rose 1.6% after activist investor Carl Icahn lost a bid to get two board seats at the company.

Oil was also on the rise. Crude Oil WTI Futures jumped 3% in early trading, to $113.90 a barrel, and Brent Oil Futures crude rose 2% to $113.68. Gold Futures was flat at $1,844 an ounce.

It's no secret that stocks and the 401(k)s that hold them have been battered and bruised this year, as every fledgling rally eventually whipsaws investors further into the red.

Last week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) nearly closed 20% down from its record high — threatening to plaster 'bear market' headlines across the evening news. But the S&P avoiding this label is little comfort to many investors, as the Nasdaq has been in bear market territory since crossing this chasm on March 7.

In this market environment, it seems everything moves up or down, with these swings changing on a day-to-day, or sometimes minute-to-minute, basis. This is not market leadership.

Bob Farrell — one of the O.G. gods of technical analysis — explains why this dynamic is such a problem for any bulls still out there. Spelling it out in rule seven of his famous 10 rules of investing, Farrell said: ""Markets are strongest when they are broad and weakest when they narrow to a handful of blue chip names.""

And narrow leadership is where we found the market roughly six months ago.

Despite the S&P 500 minting a 28% total return last year, problems were surfacing under the hood.

The following chart from Bank of America technical research strategist Stephen Suttmeier, CFA, CMT shows the New York Stock Exchange advance-decline line. This line serves as a measure of market internals, or what's going on underneath the surface of the index. Itshows how broad, or narrow, participation is in the market at a given point in time.

Signals like a deteriorating advance-decline line can grow and persist for long periods of time — frustrating both bulls and bears.

As we see in Suttmeier's chart, the S&P 500's rally that started in Q4 2020 finally stalled out and went sideways throughout most of 2021. This rally then broke to the downside in January of this year, retested the breakdown level, and travelled south to present levels.

Story continues

A textbook example of a market that lacked solid leadership. And now, the damage suffered by the biggest stocks in the market can no longer be concealed.

Last week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) earnings revealed the big box retailers suffering from margin pressure and rising inventories, news that spooked the broader markets amid concerns over inflation and consumer spending.

The five biggest losers by market cap — Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Walmart and Microsoft (MSFT) — shed a cool half a trillion dollars in market capitalization last week alone. Year-to-date, this group's losses total some $2.2 trillion.

""The breadth of the market is important,"" Suttmeier writes.

""Broad-based rallies have the potential to continue, while narrowing rallies are prone to failure. A market rally driven by a handful of blue chip names suggests that the [small- and mid-cap] troops have abandoned the largest cap generals, which is a weak setup for market breadth.""

At the beginning of the year, a buy-the-dip that had worked since the pandemic lows was the sell-side's favorite trade. But now, we're in a different economic and market regime — with soaring inflation, an increasingly hawkish Fed, shellshocked consumers, the list goes on — and buy-the-dip doesn't work anymore.

So, what to do now? Investors may be best-served playing defense, waiting for the bullish signals to mount. To be sure, these signals are adding up, but we may need a final capitulation to reach this cycle's ultimate lows.

How painful that event may be remains the market's greatest unknown.

882,Consider Roku as Cathie Wood Buys It on the Dip,"Roku (ROKU) surpassed Tesla (TSLA) as the top holding of ARK Innovation ETF. This could be Cathie Wood’s next big call. Consider picking up ROKU stock, as it’s set to win the streaming wars. ROKU Stock Will Continue Benefitting From the TCL Partnership

Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com

Like most high-growth picks in this market environment, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) investors have suffered much. ROKU stock started its decline around July of last year after it hit a high of a whopping $490 per share. It’s been on a downtrend since then, crushing investors’ hopes and dreams.

I guess ROKU stock can be a cautionary tale of trying to catch a falling knife — and I say this as a big fan of the company. Between now and April, its stock actually declined from $137 to $94. Had you invested at or near April’s peak price, you would have seen 30% of your investment value wiped out in a flash.

The continued decline is, of course, due to the tough market environment which has dominated the headlines recently. At the risk of looking foolish, I lay out why ROKU stock remains a compelling investment.

ROKU Roku $83.58

Roku as the True Winner of Streaming Wars

There is little doubt now that streaming is the future of TV entertainment. There remain a small handful of reasons to still subscribe to cable. But these reasons are dwindling quickly in the wake of aggressive moves by entertainment industry players.

The 7 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Income

Data from Roku’s most recent shareholder letter show that cable TV is basically on its dying breath. TV streaming devices surpassed legacy pay-TV devices, including Set-Top-Box and DVR, in weekly reach for the first time in the U.S. According to Nielsen data gathered by the company, in March, 65% of adults aged 18 to 49 used streaming TV compared to 63% who use legacy TV.

Entertainment industry players know this, hence the massive investments in content for streaming by the major players. The industry is poised to spend about $140 billion on content alone in 2022.

Story continues

While the major players up their content game, as an aggregator, Roku has an advantage. More content means more viewers. Assuming that translates to paying subscribers, Roku is in a prime position to actually manage all of those subscriptions in a single place.

Cathie Wood Makes a Big Bet on ROKU Stock

In a sign of confidence, famed technology investor Cathie Wood has made a significant commitment to ROKU stock. In fact, Roku recently surpassedTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the ARK Innovation ETF’s top holding. Its Roku stake is worth about $716.5 million, which is a decent chunk of change.

The movement of TSLA stock from the top holding to second place was mostly driven by the selling of its shares and not a decline in stock price. Wood has been actively selling TSLA stock during the past year. At the end of March, the fund trimmed its position of 5.8 million TSLA stock shares to about 1.6 million.

Now, a lot of people like to dunk on Cathie Wood, as high-growth investing has fallen out of vogue. However, remember that years ago, Wood was laughed out of the room when she said TSLA stock would hit $4,000. It reached this level and more on a split-adjusted basis. Could Roku be her next big call?

The factors are there. Roku is poised to emerge as the winner of the streaming market. With cable TV dying very soon, it could become the dominant platform on the market. Therefore, investors should keep an eye out for ROKU stock.

Electric vehicle (EV) stocks were among the hottest stocks during the rally after March 2020. With multi-year growth tailwinds, the surge in EV stocks was justified to a large extent. However, there was an element of euphoria.

Things have changed significantly in the last two quarters. The industry has continued to face supply chain issues. Additionally, raw material inflation is likely to impact margins. It’s also worth noting that growth stocks have been beaten down with liquidity tightening fears. This has accelerated the correction in EV stocks.

In the next few quarters, a potential recession is another headwind for the industry. However, I believe that the correction is already overdone. Stocks discount positives or headwinds well ahead of a possible event.

The 7 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Income

Let’s focus on five electric vehicle stocks that can be value creators. These five electric vehicle stocks are poised for 100% returns in the next 12 to 24 months after a deep correction:

Ticker Company Price XPEV XPeng Inc. $20.21 TSLA Tesla, Inc. $654.91 LCID Lucid Group, Inc. $16.99 RIVN Rivian Automotive, Inc. $27.02 LI Li Auto Inc. $22.06

Electric Vehicle Stocks: XPeng (XPEV)

Story continues The Logo of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng (Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors, also known as XMotors.ai) on tablet. XPEV stock.

Among Chinese EV stocks, XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) would be my top pick. In the last six months, the stock has corrected by 58%. Given the growth visibility beyond the near-term headwinds, XPEV stock is positioned to double in the next 12 months.

For first quarter (Q1) 2022, XPeng reported 159% growth in vehicle deliveries to 34,561. For the same period, revenue surged by 152% year-over-year. With supply chain challenges, deliveries growth is likely to be muted over the next two quarters.

However, the stock has discounted this concern. With new models, deliveries growth will accelerate once supply chain issues are resolved. XPeng is also being aggressive on its European expansion.

With deliveries growth and operating leverage, vehicle margin is expected to improve in the coming years. The company also ended Q1 2022 with cash and equivalents of $6.5 billion. There is ample flexibility to invest in international expansion and ramp up manufacturing capacity through 2022.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has corrected by 46% from the 52-week high of $1,243.49. This presents a good opportunity to accumulate the market leader in the EV segment.

Even with supply chain concerns, Tesla delivered 310,048 vehicles in Q1 2022. For the same period, the company reported operating cash flow of $4 billion. It’s also worth noting that Tesla had a cash buffer of $17.5 billion as of March 2022.

With robust cash flows, the company’s financial position is likely to get stronger. Importantly, it will enable robust investment in research and development. Tesla already has an attractive pipeline that includes its Cybertruck, Roadster and Tesla Semi. The new models are likely to boost deliveries growth in the next 12 to 24 months.

Additionally, Tesla’s first Gigafactory in Europe opened in March 2022. The factory has a production capacity of 500,000 vehicles. With Europe looking to reduce energy dependence on Russia, the factory comes at the right time. Once production gains traction, cash flows are likely to swell further.

7 Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Right Now

Overall, the deep correction is a good opportunity to accumulate TSLA stock. Over the next 12 to 24 months, the stock has the potential to double.

Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock is another name among electric vehicle stocks that has plunged in the last few months. I believe that the stock is worth accumulating around $15 levels.

In terms of disappointments, Lucid revised the production guidance for 2022 on the downside. This factor is already discounted in the stock.

Among positives, the company recently received an order from the government of Saudi Arabia for purchase of up to 100,000 vehicles. The company has also been taking online orders from 17 countries for Lucid Air. Therefore, there seems to be significant focus on aggressive international expansion.

Lucid is likely to report negative free cash flows (FCF) in the coming years. That should not be a concern if deliveries growth remains robust. With operating leverage, the company will be positioned to sustain healthy cash flows.

It’s also worth noting that Lucid reported cash and equivalents of $5.4 billion as of Q1 2022. The liquidity buffer is sufficient to cover for capital investments and cash burn over the next 12 to 18 months. Beyond this, further dilution of equity is likely.

Rivian (RIVN) rivn stock sign outside the company's HQ in Silicon Valley

Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock has plunged from post-listing highs of $179.50 to current levels around $27. I believe that it is a golden opportunity to accumulate RIVN stock. Recently, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) opined that Rivian is the company that’s likely to challenge Tesla in the long-term.

The company has ambitious growth plans, which include a capacity expansion to production of 600,000 vehicles annually.

The company’s R1T vehicle has also witnessed encouraging orders growth. Besides that, the electric delivery van order from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also provides long-term revenue visibility.

Rivian also has $17 billion in cash and equivalents as of March 2022. This will enable the company to pursue aggressive growth plans in the next 12 to 24 months.

Of course, cash burn is likely to sustain in the next few years. However, if the order backlog continues to swell, RIVN stock will trend higher from oversold levels.

It’s also important to note that the market for electric delivery vans is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17% through 2030. Therefore, the order from Amazon is just the beginning for Rivian.

On a 12 month basis, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has been an outperformer compared to other Chinese EV stocks. A key reason is that Li Auto continues to report free cash flows on a sustained basis.

For Q1 2022, the company reported operating cash flow and FCF of $289.3 and $79.2 million, respectively. With robust annualized cash flow visibility, LI stock has remained resilient.

It’s also worth noting that the company’s vehicle deliveries have increased on a sustained basis. The operating leverage vehicle margin has also improved.

Li Auto commenced mass deliveries of Li ONE in November 2019. The upgraded version of the model was released in May 2021. Therefore, the deliveries growth has entirely been for just one model. With plans for a broader product line in the next few years, there is robust revenue growth visibility.

As of March 2022, Li also reported cash and equivalents of $5 billion. Therefore, there is ample flexibility for investment in product development and new store expansion.

888,"After selling down Tesla position, Cathie Wood buys the dip","Longtime Tesla (TSLA) bull Cathie Wood is looking slightly less bullish these days.

Elon Musk-led electric-vehicle giant Tesla fell from its spot as the largest holding in ARK Invest’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) late last week for the first time in nearly five years, as the fund has steadily trimmed its stake in the company in recent months.

Now, Wood is snapping up shares of the beaten-down stock again.

ARK Investment Management has purchased an estimated $28 million worth of Tesla shares since Monday as a sharp sell-off in technology peers deepened losses in the hard-hit stock. The move comes after Zoom (ZM) overtook Tesla as ARKK’s largest holding, with the electric car manufacturer holding the second-largest weight in the portfolio place as of Wednesday's market close. ARK Invest declined to comment.

“Tesla has been down every day, so it’s going to be hard to maintain a position when the stock has been getting crushed that much, but I also think it does reflect a little bit of a change in confidence,” David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, told Yahoo Finance.

“A lot has happened in the last few months that would give anybody with a sense of fiduciary duty pause about what to think about Elon Musk and the businesses he’s involved in.” Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter has become part of the story for some Tesla shareholders. (Photo illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)

Wood, however, remains a vocal Tesla proponent.

When the world’s largest maker of electric cars was booted from the S&P 500 ESG index last week, Wood came to Musk’s defense on Twitter and called the move “ridiculous.”

Wood also told Yahoo Finance in an April interview that her “confidence remains highest in Tesla.” This comment came after Wood revealed ARK had met with General Motors’ (GM) CEO Mary Barra and was open to investing in the legacy automaker – a move the firm followed through on just weeks after.

Earlier this month, Ark Invest sold 15,862 shares in Tesla, worth about $12.7 million, and snapped up ​​158,187 shares of General Motors on behalf of its Autonomous Technology & Robotics (ARKQ) ETF.

Story continues

This move marked a notable shift for Wood, who has been a vocal critic of legacy automakers, and said just months ago that traditional car manufacturers like GM and Ford (F) ""don't have the DNA"" to make it in the electric vehicle space and could go bankrupt.

“One thing we have to be careful not to do is we must not have a closed mind,” Wood told Yahoo Finance about the firm's conversations with GM. “And when we see success, we have to acknowledge it and learn a lot more about it, so we're on a fact-finding mission.”

Tesla's lower ranking in ARK’s portfolio, however, coincides with escalating concerns from investors over Musk’s hot-and-cold pursuit of a deal to buy Twitter (TWTR) and questions over whether the acquisition could shift his attention away from Tesla.

ARK Innovation’s position in the electric carmaker now comprises 8.3% of the total portfolio, according to the firm’s latest available data, placing it below a 9.4% stake in top holding Zoom. Tesla had also temporarily fallen behind Roku (ROKU) earlier this week. Prior to this drop, Tesla held a seat as ARKK's most heavily-weighted allocation for four and a half years, Bloomberg data showed.

ARK has sold Tesla shares for four consecutive quarters before its recent buy, with the total number of shares it owns standing at 1.59 million as of the end of the first quarter, down from nearly 5.79 million in the same period last year, per Bloomberg.

“She’s got a fiduciary duty to get rid of a lot more but she also knows that by virtue of selling she is signaling a lack of confidence, which is dangerous for someone who has been a public proponent,” Trainer said. “I think what it says to astute investors is that Cathie Wood does not have much of an analytical basis for doing what she is doing.”

Until recently, Tesla had been a relative outperformer in Wood’s embattled ARK Innovation fund as other components were posting steep losses. Last quarter, Tesla was ARKK's top contributor, adding 40 basis points, or 0.4%, of performance to the fund for the three-month period ended March 31 as ARKK posted a quarterly loss of 29.93%. Roku and Zoom, now among the top three largest holdings, were the fund's biggest detractors, contributing 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, of the fund’s total losses for the period.

890,"The DMV said it would investigate Tesla over self-driving claims. Then, crickets","DMV Director Steve Gordon. He doesn't want to talk about Tesla. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times)

It's been a year since the California Department of Motor Vehicles opened an investigation into Tesla's sales pitch for its Full Self-Driving feature, the $12,000 software package that supposedly enables a Tesla car to drive itself through city and neighborhood streets.

It's been nearly six months since the agency, under pressure from the state Senate Transportation Committee, opened an investigation into safety issues around Full Self-Driving.

What have those investigations turned up?

The DMV won't say.

When might the results be public?

The DMV won't say.

Why is it taking so long?

The DMV won't say.

For Transportation Committee Chair Lena Gonzalez (D-Long Beach), the time for non-answers is past.

“Senator Gonzalez has made the DMV well aware of her dissatisfaction with the lack of movement on this critical public safety issue,” the lawmaker’s media spokesperson said in an email Wednesday to The Times.

The senator asked the DMV for a timeline but “the DMV has made it clear that there is no timeline nor is there a projected completion date for the investigation,” the email said.

Gonzalez is contemplating a legislative hearing on the issue. No hearing is currently planned, her office said, “but this may change as we continue to monitor progress on the investigation.”

The DMV told The Times “The review is ongoing and we will reach out to you when it is complete.”

The Internet is filled with videos of the erratic and dangerous behavior of cars running Full Self-Driving. A May 12 Tesla crash in Newport Beach that killed the car's three occupants and injured several construction workers is being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in part to see whether Tesla Autopilot or Full Self-Driving were engaged just before or during the crash.

One of the DMV investigations looks at whether Tesla is deceptively marketing the robot-car feature by using the term Full Self-Driving Capability on its online order form and other places on its website. State regulations bar automakers from using marketing language to imply a car is capable of autonomous driving when it is not. That investigation was launched in May 2021.

Story continues

The DMV’s investigation into issues raised by Gonzalez is headed into its sixth month with no end in sight. Gonzalez asked for the DMV's ""assessment of the FSD beta trials,"" for information on how the DMV will deal with the situation if it deems Full Self-Driving is unsafe, and whether there is a danger to the public.

For the last year, The Times has sought an interview with DMV head Steve Gordon, a former Silicon Valley executive, but his media relations team has declined each time. Gordon has declined similar requests from other media outlets as well. The Times asked to speak with Gov. Gavin Newsom or his designate about why his administration won't discuss the matter. The governor's staff directed the question to the DMV.

Meantime, the crashes continue.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration currently is investigating 42 crashes involving robot-controlled automated driving systems. Of those, 35 are Tesla vehicles and seven are from other carmakers.

Tesla has been selling Full Self-Driving with a growing list of features since 2016. In recent years it's been increasing the number of people it allows to use its ""beta"" version. In Silicon Valley parlance, beta means a program that functions but may contain bugs and isn't ready for broad public release.

On YouTube, Tesla customers testing the technology on public roads continue to post videos that show it quickly veering into oncoming traffic over double-yellow lines, failing to stop for semi-trucks making turns in front of the vehicles, heading toward metal poles and pedestrians, and much more.

In compliance with DMV regulations, companies such as Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional and Zoox have used professionally trained test drivers as a safety backup while testing their own autonomous-driving systems. The companies report all crashes to the DMV and also report what are known as “disengagements,” moments when the robot system fails or otherwise faces a situation that requires human driver intervention.

Tesla's exemption from those regulations is a matter of definitional parsing by the DMV. The agency, through public documents and prior statements by its media relations department, has said Full Self-Driving is a driver assist system, not an autonomous system.

The feature falls “outside the scope of DMV autonomous vehicle regulations” because it requires a human operator, Gordon told Gonzalez in a five-page letter in January. He noted that DMV regulations apply only to fully autonomous cars but said the agency would ""revisit"" that stance.

In defending the stance to Gonzalez and others, DMV officials have cited consulting work done on the agency's behalf by UC Berkeley’s California Partners for Advanced Transportation Technology, or PATH.

But Steven E. Shladover, a research engineer at PATH, said the group’s work with the DMV has been purely technical, focused on automated system capability.

“We’re not legal experts,” he said in a telephone interview. “That was just a research support contract to provide technical advice along the way.""

Tesla has made clear its “design intent” for Full Self-Driving is autonomous driving, Shladover said, and he believes the company's use of the term “is very damaging to everyone in the [autonomous vehicle] industry, because it will give the entire industry a black eye,"" given the unfinished ""beta"" state of its technology.

Shladover said he’d like to see more oversight on the state and national level — and didn’t pull any punches. “This is NHTSA’s job on the federal level,” he said. “I’d like to see NHTSA stomp on them.”

Automated vehicle law expert Bryant Walker Smith at the University of South Carolina has spoken and written extensively about the vague nature of DMV rules, crafted with language that lends itself to “linguistic loophole” exploitation. “Tesla’s use of ‘FSD’ is, shall we say, very misleading,” he wrote in an article in December for the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society.

His article noted that the Society of Automotive Engineers, whose definitions of vehicle autonomy are widely used by regulators, states in official documents that “it is incorrect” to assume that a system is not autonomous because test vehicles require human drivers.

Smith notes that Elon Musk has often often stated publicly that full autonomy for Tesla vehicles is imminent, so Full Self-Driving is being tested as a fully driverless system and thus should fall under the same DMV regulations as all the other companies.

Is the DMV closer to adopting that position than it was five months ago?

The DMV won't say.

891,Don’t Buy the Bounce in Nio Stock Just Yet,"Nio’s share price looks to be rebounding, having risen 15.3% since May 11. However, any recovery is likely to be fragile as the company continues to grapple with Covid-19 shutdowns in China and global supply chain issues. Plus, Nio’s future as a publicly listed company in the U.S. remains shrouded in uncertainty. A Nio (NIO) sign outside of the company's facilities in Shanghai, China.

After a punishing decline, it looks like the stock of Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) may have finally hit bottom.

Shares of the Shanghai-based automaker looked like they reached rock bottom on May 11 when they fell to a fresh 52-week low of $11.67. Since then, NIO stock has risen 15.3% to now trade at $14.63. However, any signs of a recovery are likely to be fragile amid continued market volatility. Investors should also keep in mind that even with the recent rally, NIO stock remains down 48.8% on the year and has fallen 55.8% over the past six months.

Listing Issues

The low point for NIO stock came as the company found itself in danger of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, where its shares trade in the U.S. The company said it was notified in early May by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it is in violation of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act due to an issue with its 2021 annual report. Apparently, the auditor Nio used to draft and review its annual report has working papers that have not been inspected or verified by the SEC nor regulators in China.

The 7 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Income

The SEC has the authority to suspend NIO stock from trading on the big board in New York if it feels such an action is warranted upon further investigation of the auditor. That prospect made already jittery investors even more concerned about Nio and its ability to continue trading in New York. However, within days, Nio, whose shares are already listed in Hong Kong, announced plans to pursue an additional listing of its stock in Singapore. News of the Singapore listing, which has already been executed, helped alleviate some of the concerns related to Nio and its stock has been rising ever since.

Supply Chain Problems

Like many automakers around the world, big or small, Nio has been grappling with supply chain problems for more than a year now. And the company says ongoing supply chain issues continue to be its biggest issue. The renewed Covid-19 restrictions that have occurred in China in recent months, particularly in Shanghai where Nio is headquartered, have not helped the company any.

Nio reported that it delivered 5,000 electric vehicles in April, half the 10,000 vehicles it delivered in March. The decline was blamed on the Covid-19 restrictions and continued difficulty in sourcing parts. Nio’s total passenger car sales were down 36% year-over-year in April due to the continued production snags. While Nio Chief Executive Officer William Li has said that consumer demand for electric vehicles in China remains strong, the company will need to get its production back on track to meet that demand.

Keep an Eye on NIO Stock

Nio continues to be the leading electric vehicle maker in China and is a main rival to global leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently upgraded Nio’s stock to a “buy” rating from “neutral” and raised its 12-month price target on the stock to $26 a share, which is 77% higher than where the shares are currently trading.

Yet, despite Nio’s long-term story remaining positive, the company faces some strong headwinds in the near term. China’s zero tolerance Covid-19 policy continues to result in damaging manufacturing shutdowns throughout the country, global supply chains remain clogged, and Nio’s future on the New York Stock Exchange has yet to be resolved.

Given these lingering uncertainties, as well as the continued gyrations in the broader market, Nio’s share price is likely to remain fragile and could reverse lower again. For these reasons, investors would should keep an eye on Nio for the time being, but avoid taking a position at this time. In the current environment, NIO stock is not a buy.

894,Twitter stock pops after Elon Musk commits $33.5 billion for takeover bid,"Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss the Twitter stock surge as Elon Musk renegotiates his takeover bid.

Video Transcript

- And then finally, speaking of deals and potential deals, let's take a look at shares of Twitter. Because they are rising here this morning. The stock also got a boost yesterday. This was after Elon Musk beefed up his financing commitment to $33.5 billion for the company.

He also revealed he's in talks for additional funding. And key here, of course, the shares of Twitter have been dropping in recent weeks. So essentially, this is a renegotiation here.

He's going to provide an additional $6.25 billion in equity financing here. And by the way, this also reduces the amount of Tesla shares that he's putting up as collateral, I believe, as part of this new structure.

- That would be important.

- And so Tesla shares are up as well this morning. Yeah, but Elon Musk has kind of a big picture problem here as his shares are under pressure. They hit $620 per share. And I think that was only yesterday or the day before, they've been cut in half.

And the reason this matters is because Elon finances his lifestyle in a lot of his purchases, whatever he wants to do, spreads his cash around on the back of those shares. He takes out loans. But he can only, I believe, take out loans on about 25% of the value of those shares. So as they go down, he has less capital to work with.

- Yes.

- And at some point-- and somebody is doing the calculation out there. Feel free to tweet at me, I'd love to know the number. What's the magic number that puts him under a lot of pressure? Just to see what it is and to see if that is a target, because Wall Street hones in on things like that.

- Yes, although there are enough Tesla and Musk fanboys that--

- There's quite a few.

- --it might be tough to--

- They got the bots too.

- Yes, exactly.",2022-05-26T13:30:25+00:00
895,10 Stocks to Sell Now According to Julian Robertson’s Hedge Fund,"In this article, we will discuss 10 stocks to sell now according to Julian Robertson's hedge fund. If you want to skip reading about Julian Robertson's early life, investment history, and his hedge fund's performance, you can go directly to 5 Stocks to Sell Now According to Julian Robertson's Hedge Fund.

Julian Robertson has earned the title ""Wizard of Wall Street"" for his legendary investment strategies that helped him beat the S&P 500 by large margins in the past. The legendary billionaire investor and philanthropist founded his hedge fund, Tiger Management, back in 1980 with an initial capital of $8 million. In 1988, the Wall Street legend grew his initial capital by roughly 3 times and turned it into $22 million. Fast forward to 1996, Tiger Management's portfolio came to a whopping $7.2 billion in value.

Mr. Robertson's trading strategies have a remarkable track record in the hedge fund industry, having returned a median of 31.7% annually between 1980 and 1998, his peak years. This is compared to the S&P 500’s median return of 12.7% per year over the same period. The billionaire followed a long-short approach toward stock investing. Mr. Robertson has reportedly said:

""Our mandate is to find the 200 best companies in the world and invest in them, and find the 200 worst companies in the world and go short on them. If the 200 best don't do better than the 200 worst, you should probably be in another business.""

Julian Robertson closed Tiger Management to outside investors in 2000, but the fund continues to operate today with investments in both public and private equity. As of 2001, Tiger Management's public equity business invests in growth companies that have remarkable management teams. As of 2003, the fund's private equity division has invested in hundreds of companies that span over 30 countries around the world.

According to the fund's Q1 2022 SEC filings, Tiger Management has initiated seven new positions and exited 13 of its Q4 2021 positions. The fund has a top ten holdings concentration of 51.09% and has the majority of its investments in the technology and financials segments. Among the top stocks discarded by billionaire investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, we have Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).

“Toast, Inc. is a cloud-based end-to-end technology platform purpose-built for the restaurant industry. Its platform provides a comprehensive suite of cloud software products and financial technology solutions to its customers to connect front-of-house with back-of-house operations across all customer channels. Toast’s core module is its point-of-sale software solution and requires all customers to use Toast as their payment processor. Customers then have the option to bundle or add-on additional modules across operations, digital ordering and delivery, marketing and loyalty, team management, and back office. Toast today powers 48,000 restaurants within the 860,000 U.S. restaurant industry, largely focusing on small- and medium-sized (“SMB”) restaurant customers (generally fewer than 10 locations but up to 50), with some larger enterprise customers as well. Toast is the clear market leader in SMB restaurant technology with the best product offering and only full, end-to-end platform. We believe that as restaurants continue to invest in technology at an accelerated pace emerging from COVID, Toast will be a big beneficiary given its leading market position and best-in-class product. At less than 6% penetration of U.S. restaurants and 3% penetration of its $15 billion recurring-revenue TAM, Toast has a long runway for growth by signing on additional locations to the platform and increasing the attach rate of its value-add modules. Only 54% of customers today use 4 or more of Toast’s 10-plus modules, each of which provide significant value to the customer and would drive Toast’s recurring revenue stream higher.”

6. Five9, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVN)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52

Five9, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVN) is a California-based provider of cloud software for contact centers in the United States and internationally.

896,Twitter deal price 'is going lower' as Elon Musk 'knows that he's overpaying': Thill,"The saga surrounding Elon Musk attempting to buy Twitter (TWTR) continues as the Tesla CEO to front $33.5 billion of his own wealth to take over Twitter, according to a new SEC filing.

Musk bid $44 billion to buy out the tech platform in April, but some observers aren't convinced that the deal will be completed at the price (if at all).

The deal price ""is going lower,"" Brent Thill, equity analyst at Jefferies, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""Elon is not a dumb guy. Like we say: 'Don't bet against Musk.' This guy knows that he's overpaying. He knows that the world has changed in the last month and that things are getting softer."" Elon Musk arrives for the 2022 Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 2, 2022, in New York. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)

The SEC disclosure came soon after Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal suggested the deal was moving forward after Musk said the acquisition was on hold until he could confirm the company's figures ""that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users.""

""We are working through the transaction process,"" Agrawal said at Twitter's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. “Even as we work toward closing this transaction, our teams and I remain focused on the important work we do every day.”

Musk has consistently to level fresh criticism at the Twitter platform, with tactics that include responding to an Agrawal tweet thread with a poop emoji.

Twitter stock popped in early trading on Thursday while Tesla stock (TSLA) — which are down more than 47% from their peak — was mostly flat.

'Things are softening'

Thill is not alone on Wall Street in his speculation that Musk might try to negotiate a lower price for the acquisition or attempt to walk away from the deal altogether.

“Our view is the massive pressure on Tesla's stock since the deal, a changing stock market/risk environment the last month, and a number of other financing factors (equity financing) has caused Musk to get 'cold feet' on the Twitter deal with the bot issue not a new issue and likely more of a scapegoat to push for a lower price,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives previously said in a note.

Story continues

Thill pointed to Snap (SNAP) stock as an indication of how much things have deteriorated for the tech sector. The stock crashed earlier this week, dragging down other tech and social media names, after the company revised its earnings forecast lower and warned of macroeconomic headwinds.

""Look at the Snap numbers, ... just a month ago, things were amazing,"" he said. ""Five weeks to go in the quarter — five weeks — they're like, we're going to be underneath the guidance we just gave you four weeks ago. What does that tell you? Things are softening materially.""

897,Why This 1 Growth Stock Could Be a Great Addition to Your Portfolio,"Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.

Achieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.

Why This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist

Different than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.

Tesla (TSLA)

Over the years, EV maker Tesla has evolved into a dynamic technology innovator. It has transformed the EV space much the same way as Amazon changed the retail landscape and Netflix revolutionized entertainment. Tesla is the market leader in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States, with roughly 70% market share. The company’s flagship Model 3 is the best-selling EV model in the United States. Tesla, which has managed to garner the reputation of a gold standard over the years, is now a far bigger entity that what it started off since its IPO in 2010, with its market cap crossing $1 trillion for the first time in October 2021.  The EV king’s market capitalization is more than the combined value of legacy automakers including Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, General Motors and Ford.

TSLA is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, with a Growth Style Score of A and VGM Score of B. Earnings are expected to grow 64.9% year-over-year for the current fiscal year, with sales growth of 60.1%.

Nine analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $1.67 to $11.18 per share for 2022. TSLA boasts an average earnings surprise of 41.3%.

Story continues

Tesla is also cash rich. The company has generated cash flow growth of 95.7%, and is expected to report cash flow expansion of 177% in 2022.

With solid fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, TSLA should be on investors' short lists.

Video Transcript

JARED BLIKRE: Yes, well, we're keeping our eye on ARK Innovation components. I have Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova here. And, Alex, so it's been an interesting week. Tesla had been the number-one holding in the ARK Innovation Fund. That changed, and Cathie Wood has been doing some interesting trading lately.

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, Jared, renewed pressure in technology stocks this week has deepened losses in some badly hit names, but that wasn't enough to stop ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood from doing some major dip buying, snapping up shares of companies including Roku, Zoom, and Tesla.

Let's take a look at Tesla here. Now up until this week, Wood had been steadily trimming her stake in Tesla for four consecutive quarters. The company even lost its spot as its top holding.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, just like we were talking about. And what happened next? Because she's been shifting some things around here.

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, in recent days she snapped up an estimated $28 million in Tesla shares as the stock has been on its way down. Now, Tesla is up today, but year to date--

JARED BLIKRE: That's where we are right now.

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: --as you can see over here--

JARED BLIKRE: It's down 35%. It's been rough. It's been a little bit rough.

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, it's been rough. And as you and I were discussing yesterday during intraday trading, it hit roughly half of the share price that it was at its all-time high.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, and I think that's important to point out. I'm going to go to a longer-term chart here. Here's a one year. Now, this is kind of ugly in here, but here's a peak. I think it was $1420, 43-- $1,243. Excuse me. And so the halfway point is down here, and you can see that's not far from giving back almost all of those gains.

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, definitely seeing some extended downturn and underperforming other growth names as Elon Musk pursues-- Elon Musk pursues his deal to purchase Twitter.

Story continues

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, all right. And let me just ask you this because there's been some other trading in Zoom and Roku as well. You want to show one of those before we go?

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, Zoom is also an interesting one. Now Zoom is now the largest holding in ARK Innovation. Interestingly, the company was one of the biggest detractors last quarter for ARK. Still Cathie Wood buying up shares of Zoom, now leading ARK Innovation.

JARED BLIKRE: All right, we've got time for one more if we do it quickly. How about Roku? That's over--

ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: The last one, Roku another detractor last quarter for Wood, down roughly 63% year to date.

Now, Wood definitely making some interesting moves. She's been known to concentrate on existing shares in her portfolio and really buy them up as they see downturn, expecting a rebound. But still eyebrow-raising moves by Wood buying up these really beaten-down names.

JARED BLIKRE: Indeed, and I know you're writing about it. Everybody check it out on YahooFinance.com.",2022-05-26T14:58:20+00:00

Operating as a value-driven hedge fund that seeks out long-short equity strategies, Greenlight Capital is known as one of the most successful activist funds in the world. Although the hedge fund recently suffered from a rough patch in recent years, characterized by Einhorn's failed short-bets against Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), the hedge fund still managed to gain 4.4% for the first quarter of 2022, outperforming the S&P 500's -4.6% return.

“The CEO of Sonos says this is the most difficult time he’s seen in the semiconductor space because of the supply chain and port difficulties. Considering Sonos is selling more in-home audio equipment than ever, his words aren’t any type of excuse. Ships are anchored out at sea waiting to get into ports, largely due to slow turnaround times because the ports have been operating at 50-70 percent of the labor they need. This should improve in the coming months with more and more people suddenly and simultaneously looking for work.”

Shares of Tesla have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (+4.4% vs. -24.6%) though the stock has been under pressure lately on market worries that Elon Musk's Twitter purchase will distract him from giving his full attention to his 'day job'. That said, despite severe chip shortage, the company has put up an impressive Q1 show, beating both top-and bottom-line expectations, thanks to stellar deliveries of Models 3 and Y. The Zacks analyst believes that deliveries to see an annualized growth of around 50% over the next three years. Ex-government credits, Tesla’s gross margins reached 30% in Q1.

This indicates that the supply-chain issues hitting the company are being passed along to the consumer. Additionally, Tesla’s energy generation and storage revenues outlook is promising. However, low Q2 deliveries from the Shanghai gigafactory could be a short-term headwind, we expect Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of production ramp-up and introduction of new models.

Shares of Procter & Gamble have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+10.1% vs. -2.0%). The company reported earnings surprise for more than three years, revenues beat estimates for the eighth straight time in the quarter. Results were driven by improved productivity amid cost headwinds, along with the rising demand for cleaning products. Gains from cost productivity also aided results. Management lifted its fiscal 2022 view. It witnessed SG&A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.

Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+21.3% vs. -37.8%). The company’s performance in the first quarter of 2022 was decent with earnings and sales beating estimates. The approval of new drugs adds a new stream of revenues, which should boost growth in the coming quarters. The pipeline progress has been impressive and strategic collaborations will further expand the portfolio.

Eliquis is the leading oral anticoagulant drug and continues to experience growth in its market share. The label expansion of Opdivo into indications of lung cancer, renal cancer and gastric cancer boosted sales. However, One of the top revenue generators Revlimid is facing generics soon, which will adversely impact sales. Lowering of guidance by the company was also disappointing.

905,Tech Selloff: Hedge Funds are Dumping These 10 Stocks in 2022,"In this article, we discuss the 10 stocks hedge funds are dumping amid the tech selloff in 2022. If you wish to skip our comprehensive review of the latest market situation around tech stocks, go directly to Tech Selloff: Hedge Funds are Dumping These 5 Stocks in 2022.

Investors are offloading growth stocks that don't do well during times of market uncertainty, and moving their money to safe haven assets as many analysts predict the coming of a recession. The CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein recently said that there was a ""a very, very high risk factor"" that the US economy could head towards a recession, and advised consumers and the bosses of big companies to prepare themselves for a potential crisis.

Inflation in the United States reached a 40-year record high of 8.5% in March, before settling at 8.3% in April. Soaring energy prices have also cut deep into the pockets of consumers across the country. According to official state records filed by 10 major utility companies in New York, approximately 1.3 million households in the state are at least two months behind on their utility bills, amassing a collective debt of more than $1.7 billion. As of February 2022, the cost of natural gas and electricity had gone up 24% and 9% respectively from year-ago figures.

The sell-off in the technology sector reflects the investors' anxiety within the current macro setup. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite has slid more than 27% since the start of the year, and major names like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have suffered heavy drops in recent months. On May 23, social media firm Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) issued a warning to investors that it would fail to meet its own quarterly targets for revenue and adjusted earnings, stating that ""the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated.” This led to a bloodbath on the stock market, as the company shares slumped 43% in a single day on Tuesday, taking down a host of other tech/internet names along with it.

Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin on May 18 kept an 'Overweight' rating on Smartsheet Inc. (NYSE:SMAR) shares, noting that software valuations have taken an outsized impact as of late owing to rising inflation, interest rate hikes, Russia-Ukraine tensions, and tightening labor markets. All of these factors have also contributed to a tough spend environment and chances of a recession in late-2022/2023, according to the analyst, who lowered his price target on the company shares to $55 from $70. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill on May 23 gave Smartsheet Inc. (NYSE:SMAR) a 'Buy' rating and decreased the price target to $50 from $75.

“Smartsheet provides a cloud based-based platform for work management that lets employees plan and manage their work using grids, projects, cards and calendars. It enhances enterprise productivity and as such is a Positive Dynamic Change beneficiary of corporate America’s rapid digitization. We believe even as employees return to the office, demand for work management software is persistent and durable. The strong value proposition was evident in Smartsheet’s recent quarter as revenue growth and billings accelerated relative to recent periods driven by an increased mix toward upmarket enterprise level customers. Additionally, management provided guidance for next fiscal year of 37% to 40% billings growth versus a 26% consensus expectation.”

8. Coupa Software Incorporated (NASDAQ:COUP)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Decline in Hedge Fund Holders: 13

However, Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges noted on May 12 that business spend management is maturing as a category and the next phase of share price gain will be more difficult to come by.

On May 24, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill lowered the firm's price target on Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) to $40 from $48 and reiterated a 'Hold' rating on the shares.

For the first quarter, Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) reported earnings per share of $0.90, outperforming estimates by $0.87. Revenue of $1.20 billion for the quarter was below consensus estimates by $25 million but grew 15.92% year-on-year.

6. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)

(NYSE:SHOP) shares, and slashed the firm's price target to $475 from $550, noting that consumer behavior is shifting amidst a slowdown in e-commerce spending. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian kept an ‘Outperform’ rating on Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) shares on May 6, noting that the firm's Q1 results which fell below expectations were not surprising given weakening e-commerce trends as of late. However, he maintains a long-term bullish view on the company across e-commerce, payments, software and fulfilment, but sees near-term headwinds in the macro environment amid shifting consumer spending patterns. He revised the price target to $630 from $1000.

Baron Funds, an investment firm, discussed the market position of Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. The fund said:

“Shopify Inc. is a cloud-based software provider offering an operating system for multi-channel commerce. Shopify has been adopted by over two million merchants who processed $175 billion of gross merchandise volume in 2021, making it the second largest e-commerce player in the U.S. The stock corrected sharply in the first quarter, declining 51%, as a result of investor rotation out of fast-growing, long-duration stocks and after the company released quarterly results, expecting a normalization in the rapid growth it has experienced during the early stages of the pandemic. We remain shareholders as we believe Shopify has a long runway for growth addressing less than 1% of global commerce spending with a unique and competitively advantaged platform.”

Just like Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some tech names under pressure within the current market situation.

AKIKO FUJITA: You have a lot of people talking with these accounts. Why did you start this in the first place?

JACK SWEENEY: Originally, it was just interest in following Elon Musk because I thought he was a cool person with Tesla and SpaceX and all that. And it's interesting to see where he goes. You know, he's either in Austin or Brownsville, doing all kinds of work, you know. And it's crazy to see where they go. And they're just trying to be, like, the most efficient they can, doing everything possibly as quick as possible.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Hey, Jack, it's Brian here. So this is a story that turned a little spicy because you actually got in touch with Elon, as I understand it. Give us kind of the breakdown of what your conversation was like him, as I understand it, over DMs on Twitter. You turned down money from Elon to shut this down because he didn't want you having this out there. What happened after that?

JACK SWEENEY: Yeah, so at the beginning, he was like, can you take this down? It's a security risk. And he was, like, actually, asking how it worked. He didn't-- he had no understanding of how it even worked. And then he offered me the five grand. And I asked for 50, and it took a couple of weeks. And he was like, it doesn't feel right to pay to take it down anymore.

AKIKO FUJITA: Jack, can you talk about how you go about tracking these jets? Because I mean, we're sort of jumping all over the place, but you're no longer just tracking Elon Musk. You're tracking other billionaires as well. How do you go about using all the data that's out there to identify them?

Story continues

JACK SWEENEY: So, a lot of times, they're registered to certain companies that can be linked, or you can see-- there's, like, pictures that they're actually coming out of that plane. And you can link it to where they've flown. And you're like, oh, that's definitely that person. But with Elon Musk, it's registered to a subsidiary of SpaceX, Falcon Landing. Mark Zuckerberg was a bit harder. And I just found his real one recently.

BRIAN CHEUNG: Jack, I mean, who are the types of people that you think are interested in looking at this? Obviously, you've gotten a lot of traction, a lot of attention. But it seems like some of this is tied in with the skepticism that people have over how much money goes into them jet-setting around the world, getting a lot of private detail and security to make all these types of trips. How much of this is about that versus just having fun with it, I guess, yourself?

JACK SWEENEY: I think there's all kinds of people. Like, some people-- hedge funds also, they-- I've heard that they track some of the people around to see what deals people are doing with other companies and all that. So, you know, and then other people are criticizing the people about their carbon and all kinds of other reasons that are just interested and all that.

BRIAN CHEUNG: All right, Jack Sweeney, ElonJet founder. Again, you can find that account on Twitter. Thanks so much for stopping by this morning. We appreciate it.",2022-05-26T16:01:04+00:00

909,Tesla submits application to expand German plant - rbb,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Tesla has submitted an application to build on a further 100 hectares east of its plant in Germany, expanding the site's area by a third, local newspaper rbb reported on Thursday, citing the local mayor.

The electric carmaker, which already has 300 hectares of land for its auto factory and battery plant under construction, planned to build a freight station, logistics areas and parking spaces on the additional space, Gruenheide mayor Arne Christiani told RBB.

The proposal will be discussed at a municipality meeting on June 2.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Gruenheide plant, which at full capacity will produce 500,000 electric cars a year, began production in March 2022 after a series of licensing delays which chief executive Elon Musk said ran counter to the urgency needed to tackle climate change.

Local water suppliers warned when Tesla was granted final approval to begin production at the factory that servicing any future expansion to the plant will be impossible without importing water from other regions.

910,"Crypto Scammers Pose as Journalists, NFT Projects on Twitter","(Bloomberg) -- Internet scammers are using hijacked accounts on Twitter Inc. to promote dubious cryptocurrency platforms that, once installed, enable them to compromise victims’ sensitive data, according to new findings provided exclusively to Bloomberg News.

Since March, fraudsters have impersonated journalists, crypto apps and a variety of nonfungible token (NFT) projects on Twitter in order to steal users’ virtual currency, usernames and password credentials, according to research from Satnam Narang, a staff research engineer at the cybersecurity firm Tenable Inc. Many of the targeted accounts are verified, an indication to investigators that scammers are either hacking specific pages, paying for illicit access, or both.

As part of the alleged scam, thieves have masqueraded as members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, a popular collection of NFTs, as well as the Azuki collection, the MoonBirds project and the Okay Bears NFT community, which has more than 150,000 Twitter followers, Narang found.

In one instance, scammers posed as a legal affairs reporter from the Age, an Australia-based news service, asking users to visit a suspicious link in order to claim a small amount of the virtual currency Ethereum, according to the research. Intruders also appear to have temporarily taken over the Twitter page of a freelance journalist who covers the gaming industry and created profiles that appear similar to real ones, according to the findings.

The imposter Twitter accounts have typically encouraged followers to visit specific links, or download new apps, Narang said. Those apps often persuade users to provide access to their mobile cryptocurrency wallets, from which the attackers can quickly extract funds. Each of the fraudsters’ pages, whether an app or a phishing link, are carefully designed to look like legitimate, trustworthy websites, according to the findings.

Story continues

The tactic represents an upgrade from a more traditional fraud technique of mass-spamming social media users, or impersonating famous people, such as Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, an outdated tactic that’s relatively simple to detect, Narang said in an interview. The use of verified Twitter accounts adds a layer of legitimacy, and the chance to seize on a money-making opportunity in cryptocurrency adds some urgency to the scheme, said Narang.

“They look indistinguishable from real sites, and people just aren’t looking closely at the links,” he said.

When a Bloomberg News reporter analyzed an app that purported to be for Azuki, an anime-themed NFT project with more than 300,000 followers, it was flagged as malware.

In May, scammers used a fraudulent Twitter page @OlthersideMeta, that tricked users into believing it was @OthersideMeta, a legitimate site that blends video games with the metaverse, according to the research.

Losses incurred from the scams are difficult to quantify, however the activity is the latest example of attackers leveraging cryptocurrency -- and the hype surrounding popular projects -- to generate funds. Americans reported more than $1.6 billion in cryptocurrency-related fraud in 2021, a massive uptick from the $246 million the year before, according to the FBI’s internet crime complaint center report. The true figure is likely to be much higher, as many would-be investors flock to speculation-style schemes and don’t report instances of fraud, Narang said.

“Scammers are so adept at pivoting into what people are interested in,” he added. “This is a small sampling of what’s happening across this space.”

(Updated to fix style issue, then to include a link to Tenable research.)

The market is rallying for a second straight day and shares of hydrogen champion Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) are enjoying an outsized lift. PLUG stock is up 9% compared the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s gain of 3%.

It’s no secret Wall Street has been a wreck for most stocks in 2022. From supply chain snarls to inflation at multi-decade highs and hawkish, behind the eight ball central bankers trying to reign in prices while avoiding a recession, it has been a tough environment.

And those challenges have been particularly harder for smaller growth narratives, even market leaders like Plug Power whose shares remain down 41% year-to-date and nearly 80% from their multi-decade peak of $75.49 in late January 2021. But it’s time to see the opportunity and look past the fear.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Let’s look at the reasons why a more sustainable bull market in PLUG stock is likely to emerge and how to buy into that potential more smartly.

Ticker Company Current Price PLUG Plug Power $17.10

Plug Power Is Making the Right Moves

First, let’s get the ugly stuff out of the way. PLUG stock is losing money. Plug Power’s losses are growing. Plug Power is burning cash. And surging natural gas prices, which drive much of today’s hydrogen production, are making those red-line items more of an eyesore.

But those are shorter-term headwinds for PLUG. The thing is Plug Power is building an increasingly sustainable business for an alternative “green hydrogen” fuel source and economy whose time has finally arrived.

I’m not bold enough to call PLUG The “Tesla of Hydrogen” as InvestorPlace’s Luke Lango has. Nevertheless, Plug Power is the real deal and an undisputed leader in hydrogen’s role as a powerful decarbonization solution for business.

The 7 Best Reddit Stocks to Buy for June 2022

Just last month, Plug’s industry leading position was reinforced with a new agreement with longstanding customer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to supply green hydrogen for as many as 9,500 of the retailers forklifts across its fulfillment and distribution centers.

Story continues

Most recently, PLUG received an order to supply a gigawatt (GW) electrolyzer to hydrogen fuel-cell outfit H2 Energy Europe. If investors can keep their eye on the ball rather than the Federal Reserve’s eight ball, Plug Power stands to see $500 million in revenues in 2024 from that deal alone. That’s not all that investors have to be upbeat about either.

PLUG Stock Is Also Making The Right Moves Plug Power (PLUG) triple bottoming in play for PLUG stock buyers

Source: Charts by TradingView

With PLUG stock’s Rochester electrolyzer gigafactory expected to come online in 2025 and the equipment key to making green hydrogen production competitively priced for broader commercial use, Plug Power’s recently reiterated sales growth guidance of 80% on revenues of $900 million to $925 million for 2022 stands to balloon to $3 billion in 2025.

Plug Power makes for a compelling opportunity for PLUG shareholders as well.

Valued at just under $10 billion and with $2.5 billion in cash and equivalents, the company is well-positioned to make good on its intermediate-term objectives. From there, even if PLUG was to only capture a fraction of the success Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has enjoyed, it’s fair to say that buying Plug Power can still prove a huge win with significant upside for investors.

And technically, that starting point could be in play for PLUG buyers right now.

Today shares are on the cusp of trading above an inside weekly chart candlestick. Stationed within a triple bottoming pattern that has formed over the past twelve months and with stochastics giving the green light, a Plug Power purchase obviously has a lot working in its favor.

Buying PLUG Stock

One other benefit of buying PLUG stock today is the broader market. The way the session is shaping up into Thursday’s close, the major averages should confirm a rally attempt out of this year’s corrective bottom with a historically bullish follow-through day (FTD).

The price and volume event is never a guarantee of success, but a transition into a bull market is never complete without a FTD signal in place.

Appreciating PLUG’s own weekly chart dynamics where we’re expecting the bottom to hold, but also aware of a slightly more bearish lower-high formation from March, I’d propose buying shares with a July $12.50 put for protection.

Then, and if shares rally toward $25 in the weeks ahead, adjusting into a fully hedged and actively managed collar position is a calculated strategy that leaves less room to chance.

918,UPDATE 1-U.S. Senate confirms auto safety chief amid traffic death spike,"(Adds more details on traffic data, background)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, May 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed by voice vote President Joe Biden's nominee to serve as the top auto safety regulator, the first to win approval since January 2017 and as U.S. traffic deaths have risen to the highest level in 16 years.

Steven Cliff has been serving as deputy administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) since February 2021 and was nominated by Biden for the top job in October. His approval by the Senate comes amid soaring U.S. traffic deaths and several ongoing investigations into safety issues at Tesla Inc.

Cliff, a former deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, was a key figure in the Biden administration's rewrite of fuel economy standards through 2027. NHTSA is beginning to hold discussions about the next round of fuel economy increases.

The Governors Highway Safety Association praised Cliff's approval and noted NHTSA ""went more than five years without a confirmed leader.""

NHTSA says U.S. traffic deaths jumped 10.5% in 2021 to 42,915 - the highest number killed on American roads in a single year since 2005.

The yearly increase was the highest reported since NHTSA began using its current traffic fatality tracking system in 1975. The number of pedestrians killed jumped 13% to 7,342, hitting the highest number since 1981. The number of people on bicycles killed rose 5% to 985, the highest number since at least 1975.

NHTSA in August opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles. In October, NHTSA asked Tesla why it has not issued a recall to address software updates made to its Autopilot driver-assistance system.

Cliff in December said he hoped NHTSA would soon finish its investigations into Tesla crashes involving automated driving systems. Last week, NHTSA said it opened a special crash investigation into a May 12 Tesla fatal crash in California that resulted in three deaths and could have been caused by its advanced driver assistance system.

919,Biden Pick Wins Senate Approval as First NHTSA Chief Since 2017,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s pick to run the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration won the approval of the Senate, giving the agency its first full-time chief since 2017.

Steven Cliff has been the agency’s interim chief since January 2021. He is a former deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, which regulates auto emissions in the Golden State. A key senator previously had blocked Cliff from advancing to the post for months, but he was was approved on a voice vote Thursday after navigating through a smooth confirmation vote in a Senate committee.

NHTSA, the federal regulator charged with keeping US roads safe, had been in its fifth year without a permanent administrator.

Prior to tapping Cliff, Biden faced pressure to appoint a permanent NHTSA chief from safety advocates who were concerned about uptick in the number of US traffic deaths despite reduced driving early in the pandemic. Additionally, the agency has ramped up its politically fraught investigation of Tesla Inc. and may be on a collision course with the electrive-vehicle maker over its controversial Autopilot system.

Biden needed to renominate many of his transportation picks, including Cliff, last year after their nominations lapsed over the Senate’s holiday recess.

US Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, had been stalling on Transportation and Commerce Department nominees since November, saying that he will continue until the commerce panel convenes a hearing with the departments’ secretaries on supply-chain bottlenecks. A Scott spokesperson confirmed he released the hold after Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo agreed to testify before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on April 27.

920,The housing market is ‘overinflated’: Barbara Corcoran,"The Corcoran Group founder and Shark Tank star Barbara Corcoran speaks with Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal on the state of the housing market, whether it's a good time to buy a home, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk's latest antics.

Video Transcript

DAVE BRIGGS: Yet another sign of a cooling real estate market. Data shows pending home sales sliding for a sixth straight month in April as mortgage rates continue to creep up. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal caught up with ""Shark Tank"" investor and founder of the Corcoran Group Real Estate, Barbara Corcoran, to discuss what she's seeing in the market. Allie, what did she tell you?

ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's right, Dave. I finally had a chance to sit down with Babs, my favorite shark from ""Shark Tank."" And she had a lot to say when it came to the real estate market. You mentioned that we got a slew of economic data out this week, mortgage rates dropping for the second straight week, but still above that sky high 5% level. And those high borrowing costs are beginning to take a toll on purchases. So I asked Barbara, are we entering a bubble of sorts? Is this bubble about to burst? Here's what she had to say.

BARBARA CORCORAN: I don't believe so, although you can't predict the future, but my own feeling in all the years of real estate is that the market is overinflated, granted, ask any new homebuyer whether they think they're paying the right price for a house. It just keeps running away and getting higher and higher. But the demand is so much far exceeding how many houses are out to go around. No, I think we're going to have a needed softening in the market, meaning prices aren't going to go up as fast, if you could call that a softening.

But it's good in a way because, I mean, I don't want prices to come down. They're not going to. But it gives more people an opportunity to catch up with the market, catch up with themselves, maybe buy their first house. So I see it as a tempering is kind of good. Nobody likes high interest rates. It costs you more to buy a house, but it's going to keep things a little bit more normal. And I'm really looking forward to that, yeah.

Story continues

ALEXANDRA CANAL: And to that point, what's your advice to new homebuyers? Should they wait it out, wait till prices drop, or do you think this is going to be around for some time?

BARBARA CORCORAN: No, nothing but waiting, because prices will-- my opinion-- prices do continue to go up. And you pay more for the house because interest rates are going up. I think in real estate, most middle class people have the greatest wealth from their home when they're ready to retire. And I think you have to get in the game. You have to get in with whatever house you can possibly buy, so you have a chip to play in the game and trade up and trade up and trade up. And that becomes a retirement fund.

So, no, I think the sooner, the better. You really can't sharpshoot a real estate market. You can kind of get close, but what you have to do is answer your family's needs. And people just like to own where they live, hang a picture on their wall, not the landlord's wall. There's somewhat psychic gain also in owning. So no, for so many reasons. I mean, I wish I could buy everybody in America a house, not to repeat that, because I can't afford it. But everybody should have their house. I just think it still is the American dream.

ALEXANDRA CANAL: And to that point, do you have certain cities or markets that you have an eye on when it comes to this boom that we're seeing in the real estate market?

BARBARA CORCORAN: Well, the boom has been in every city. In the South, it's been a greater boom than certainly in the East and the West. But there isn't a single market that I would point to, saying it has a much better chance, because the one thing when you buy into a market that's the highest market, it comes down the fastest, too, or it simmers down the fastest. So I think you should buy where you most want to live. I think that's a great guide as to where you should buy. You don't approach buying a home like an investor. It's not about that. It's about buying a home for your family. That's really where your head should be at.

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Some interesting advice there. Get in the game, don't sharpshoot the market, and don't approach home buying like an investor. Got to love Barbara Corcoran.

SEANA SMITH: We always do, Allie. And I know we have heard Barbara talk about Elon Musk in the past. Now he's been in the news. There's been so much going on with the Twitter deal. And also, he's been so vocal on Twitter, as he always is. What are her feelings just about him and what we've learned about him and learned about some of his approaches to things over the last several weeks?

ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, so I really wanted to get her take on Musk because Barbara previously sung his praises during an interview with Yahoo Finance. Not too long ago, January 2020, she called him a winner. Said, any great leader is a little rough around the edges, has a strong opinion. But today, she has a much different take. Here's what she said.

BARBARA CORCORAN: Well, I'd like to zip in a Ziploc bag and try to get his ego stuffed inside and calm him down. He's a bit much lately. I liked him better who he was than who he is lately. It's kind of like, way a little bit out of hand. So I'm hoping he could simmer down. He needs a good woman to put him in his place.

ALEXANDRA CANAL: So that's her take, a good woman to put Elon Musk in his place. Of course, there's been a lot of drama when it comes to his $44 billion Twitter takeover deal. Just last night, a new lawsuit was filed by Twitter investors who alleged that he manipulated the market to drive down Twitter's stock. He also did not timely disclose his stake in the company under SEC law. So there's been a lot of questions about whether or not this deal will actually go through, let alone at that $44 billion price tag. So a lot to watch with Musk, but he's losing a fan right now in Barbara.

SEANA SMITH: And you never want to do that. And I totally agree with what Barbara was saying. She just needs to get-- he needs to get--

DAVE BRIGGS: A good woman?

SEANA SMITH: A good woman, but more so, his ego just needs to be checked right now.

DAVE BRIGGS: No question, but a good woman can do that.

SEANA SMITH: A good woman can do that. I don't know.

DAVE BRIGGS: Strong woman.

SEANA SMITH: Elon Musk, you might want to listen to Barbara Corcoran.

DAVE BRIGGS: Barbara.

SEANA SMITH: She normally knows what she's talking about.

DAVE BRIGGS: I like it.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Allie Canal, thanks so much for bringing us that.",2022-05-26T21:20:54+00:00
921,7 Best Auto Stocks to Buy in June,"Consider these seven auto stocks for your investment portfolio before they resume kicking it into high gear. Ford (F): Once near-term issues subside, Ford’s electric vehicle (EV) rollout could send it speeding higher again. Fisker (FSR): While considered an underdog, this EV play has a good chance of achieving success. Lucid Motors (LCID): Crowned a winner too soon, but still a top contender among electric vehicle makers. Li Auto (LI): This Chinese EV maker will likely recover when its troubles fade. Ferrari (RACE): An auto stock in a league of its own, and one to consider at current prices. Tesla (TSLA): Market and Musk-related volatility are a sign of opportunity, not a sign to stay away.

The automotive revolution is still in motion. For now, though, it’s taking a pit stop. At least, that’s the takeaway from the recent performance of auto stocks.

Why is this? Like many other sectors, inflation and recession fears have put pressure on auto plays across the board. And industry challenges like the supply chain crisis have also had an impact.

This includes both EV pure plays, as well as incumbent automakers. In some cases, a plunge in price was justified. When the excitement over the rise of EVs kicked it into high gear, many names with poor fundamentals went to unsustainable valuations. In turn, those are names you can leave in the lot.

Auto Stocks to Buy: Ford (F)

A few years back, the consensus was that EV-only companies would leave “old school” Detroit automakers like Ford (NYSE:F) in the dust. However, starting in 2021, investors began to embrace the prospect of incumbent automakers not only surviving the EV revolution but actively participating in it as well.

Last year, and up until the start of this year, this legendary car maker’s big pivot into EVs jolted the F stock price. Shares hit levels not seen in more than 20 years. Unfortunately, due to both the cooldown in EV plays, along with the company’s chip shortage headwinds, it’s taken a big hit since January.

Even so, don’t view this as a sign that Ford investors will have to wait another 20 years for the stock to crack $20 per share again. Once it gets over these headwinds and continues ramping up EV production, the stock could make a strong recovery.

This stock earns a “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

Among the EV and auto stocks, there are plenty of underdogs. Many of these names simply lack what’s needed to live up to expectations. However, that’s not the case here with Fisker (NYSE:FSR). Yes, as one of the smaller EV upstarts, it has its work cut out for it.

Additionally, not launching its flagship Ocean SUV until later this year makes Fisker a little behind the eight ball. Many of its peers already have their vehicles available for sale. Yet, while FSR stock has delivered mixed performance since its debut, I wouldn’t say it’s an auto stock destined to end up in the market junkyard.

With high demand for the Ocean and Fisker’s capital-light approach to scaling up (by partnering with a larger automotive company for production), the company may not only speed out of the pre-revenue stage quickly. It could get to the point of profitability much sooner as well.

In my opinion, Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) was crowned a winner among EV plays too quickly. There’s a lot to suggest it will deliver on its promises, and become a major producer of luxury EVs. Still, it’s had some growing pains, and will likely continue to do so.

Due to the supply chain crisis, the company has had to walk back production targets. This, coupled with the pressures listed above, LCID stock has dropped massively in price, and is currently skidding around $20 per share.

For investors bullish on the EV trend with a long time horizon, this may be a great entry point. While it’s facing production hiccups, demand remains high for Lucid’s flagship Air vehicle. In fact, the company has even received an order from the Saudi Arabian government that could total 100,000 vehicles over the next decade.

Thus, while it was too quickly crowned a winner, Lucid is nonetheless a top contender. So, consider it a top member of the auto stocks to buy.

Along with the general supply chain crisis, China-based EV makers like Li Motors (NASDAQ:LI) have had to contend with another issue: China’s latest novel coronavirus lockdowns. Starting in March, an outbreak of the omicron variant has resulted in stringent lockdowns for many of China’s major cities.

Among other disruptions, this has severely impacted electric vehicle production. As a result, Li, like its peers, has seen a large sequential (month-over-month) drop in its delivery numbers. In April, deliveries of its Li ONE EV fell 62% compared to March.

Compared to other Chinese electric EV stocks, admittedly LI stock hasn’t taken as sharp of a plunge this year. Nevertheless, these disruptions, along with other concerns, are keeping it depressed and could continue to do so in the short term. Looking beyond the current headwinds, though, Li is still an EV growth play well-positioned to bounce back.

Auto Stocks to Buy: Ferrari (RACE) Ferrari logo on a red banner

After looking at a trio of EV stocks, let’s take a look at one of the incumbent automakers. Albeit, one more exciting than Ford, General Motors (NYSE:GM) or this company’s former parent, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA). I am talking about Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), and it is in a league of its own when it comes to auto stocks.

Between high operating margins and a prestigious, exclusive brand that’s always in demand, the Italian luxury sportscar maker faces fewer of the issues the low-margin, highly-cyclical mainstream auto business must contend with. That’s why RACE stock manages to command a valuation fitting of its premium status.

Of course, this doesn’t mean Ferrari stock is sell-off proof. In fact, RACE stock is down 24% year-to-date (YTD) due to the external factors wreaking havoc on the market. There is a silver lining to this, however. The opportunity to scoop up shares in this unique, high-quality business at a fair price.

Take a look at a stock chart, and you may think it’s the beginning of the end for shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Dropping around 33% YTD, and trending lower, you may be concerned that, by buying this auto stock, you’re trying to catch a falling knife rather than getting a bargain.

However, if you consider the reasons for the recent drop in TSLA stock, you’ll realize the party’s not quite over. Namely, because much, if not most, of its decline is due to the short-term issues affecting other EV stocks at present. Also, something that has little to do with the company’s underlying performance is playing a role as well.

That would be the drama with Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s latest side hustle. Put simply, these factors do little to change this leading EV maker’s growth picture, making the current volatility a buying opportunity.

Similar to Li Auto, XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), another Chinese EV maker, is dealing with the short-term issues resulting from China’s latest lockdowns. For example, it too saw a high drop in sequential deliveries. Yet as InvestorPlace’s David Moadel recently argued, the company is performing quite well, considering the challenges.

While deliveries are down 41% sequentially, they’re up 75% year-over-year (YOY). Its latest earnings results also show its resiliency, despite the headwinds. And so, this strong performance points to it getting back into high-growth mode, when current troubles pass — which they will.

Although still in the red YTD, the prospect of high growth more than makes up for this. As it continues to scale up, losses will narrow. And in time, it will likely go from negative to positive earnings. This all points to a solid chance of a recovery, and an eventual move to new all-time highs.

This stock earns a “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

922,"Twitter shareholders sue Musk, claim he sought to drive down stock price","Twitter shareholders allege Elon Musk, above, has sought to drive down Twitter's stock price because he wants to walk away from the deal or negotiate a substantially lower purchase price. (Patrick Pleul / Associated Press)

Twitter shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of engaging in “unlawful conduct” aimed at sowing doubt about his bid to buy the social media company.

The lawsuit filed late Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claims the billionaire Tesla chief executive has sought to drive down Twitter’s stock price because he wants to walk away from the deal or negotiate a substantially lower purchase price.

San Francisco-based Twitter is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, which seeks class-action status as well as compensation for damages.

A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Twitter declined to comment.

Musk last month offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion but later said the deal can’t go forward until the company provides information about how many accounts on the platform are bots.

The lawsuit notes, however, that Musk waived due diligence for his “take it or leave it” offer to buy Twitter. That means he waived his right to look at the company’s nonpublic finances.

In addition, the problem of bots and fake accounts on Twitter is nothing new. The company paid $809.5 million last year to settle claims that it was overstating its growth rate and monthly user figures. Twitter has also disclosed its bot estimates to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for years, while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low.

To fund some of the acquisition, Musk has been selling Tesla stock, and shares in the electric-car maker have lost nearly a third of their value since the deal was announced April 25.

In response to the plunging value of Tesla’s shares, the Twitter shareholders' lawsuit claims Musk has been denigrating Twitter, violating both the nondisparagement and nondisclosure clauses of his contract with the company.

""In doing so, Musk hoped to drive down Twitter’s stock price and then use that as a pretext to attempt to renegotiate the buyout,” according to the lawsuit.

Story continues

Twitter's shares closed Thursday at $39.52, 27% below Musk's $54.20 offer price.

Before announcing his bid to buy Twitter, Musk disclosed in early April that he had bought a 9% stake in the company. But the lawsuit says Musk did not disclose the stake within the time frame required by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

And the lawsuit says his eventual disclosure of the stake to the SEC was “false and misleading” because he used a form meant for “passive investors” — which Musk at the time was not, because he had been offered a position on Twitter's board and was interested in buying the company.

Musk reaped a benefit of more than $156 million from his failure to disclose his increased stake on time, since Twitter's stock price could have been higher had investors known Musk was increasing his holdings, the lawsuit claims.

“By delaying his disclosure of his stake in Twitter, Musk engaged in market manipulation and bought Twitter stock at an artificially low price,” the lawsuit says.

Top Stock Reports for Tesla, Procter & Gamble and Bristol Myers-Squibb

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Tesla, Inc., The Procter & Gamble Co., and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

Shares of Tesla have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (+4.4% vs. -24.6%) though the stock has been under pressure lately on market worries that Elon Musk's Twitter purchase will distract him from giving his full attention to his 'day job.' That said, despite severe chip shortage, the company has put up an impressive Q1 show, beating both top-and bottom-line expectations, thanks to stellar deliveries of Models 3 and Y.

The Zacks analyst believes that deliveries will see annualized growth of around 50% over the next three years. Ex-government credits, Tesla's gross margins reached 30% in Q1.

This indicates that the supply-chain issues hitting the company are being passed along to the consumer. Additionally, Tesla's energy generation and storage revenues outlook is promising. However, low Q2 deliveries from the Shanghai gigafactory could be a short-term headwind, we expect Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of production ramp-up and introduction of new models.

Shares of Procter & Gamble have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+10.1% vs. -2.0%). The company reported earnings surprises for more than three years, revenues beat estimates for the eighth straight time in the quarter.

Results were driven by improved productivity amid cost headwinds, along with the rising demand for cleaning products. Gains from cost productivity also aided results. Management lifted its fiscal 2022 view. It witnessed SG&A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.

However, The Zacks analyst believes unfavorable mix, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins. It expects higher commodity and freight costs to persist in fiscal 2022.

Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+21.3% vs. -37.8%). The company's performance in the first quarter of 2022 was decent with earnings and sales beating estimates. The approval of new drugs adds a new stream of revenues, which should boost growth in the coming quarters. The pipeline progress has been impressive and strategic collaborations will further expand the portfolio.

Eliquis is the leading oral anticoagulant drug and continues to experience growth in its market share. The label expansion of Opdivo into indications of lung cancer, renal cancer and gastric cancer boosted sales. However, One of the top revenue generators Revlimid is facing generics soon, which will adversely impact sales. Lowering of guidance by the company was also disappointing.

924,Elon Musk sued by Twitter investors for ‘driving down takeover price’,"Elon Musk Twitter - ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images

Elon Musk is being sued by Twitter investors for driving down the social network’s share price in an effort to cut the price of his $44bn (£35bn) takeover.

Mr Musk has illegally attempted to “mitigate personal [financial] risks to himself by engaging in unlawful conduct that moved the price of Twitter’s stock down,” according to a lawsuit filed in California.

William Heresniak filed the lawsuit on behalf of himself and other Twitter shareholders against the Tesla billionaire and Twitter itself.

The lawsuit claims Mr Musk is making false statements and engaging in “market manipulation” to negotiate a cut-price deal.

Twitter’s shares have fallen heavily in recent weeks, despite Mr Musk agreeing to buy the company for $54.20 a share, after he said he had put the deal on hold and suggested he should get a discount due to the number of fake accounts on the service.

They are currently trading at $39.52, 27pc below Mr Musk’s offer price, with the company’s market value $14bn below the offer price.

“Musk proceeded to make statements, send tweets, and engage in conduct designed to create doubt about the deal and drive Twitter’s stock down substantially in order to create leverage that Musk hoped to use to either back out of the purchase or re-negotiate the buyout price,” the lawsuit states.

Mr Heresniak is seeking to have the lawsuit designated as a class action, allowing other Twitter shareholders to join it, and for Mr Musk compensate the company’s shareholders for the declining value of their investment. The lawsuit demands that Twitter “investigate Musk’s conduct and take appropriate action”.

It also seeks damages from Mr Musk for failing to disclose his status as a Twitter investor earlier in March. The Tesla chief executive only revealed that he had purchased a 9.2pc stake in the company after the traditional deadline.

“By delaying his disclosure of his stake in Twitter, Musk engaged in market manipulation and bought Twitter stock at an artificially low price,” the lawsuit states.

Story continues

Mr Musk said two weeks ago that the deal was “on hold” pending further information about the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter. He has disputed the company’s figures saying less than 5pc of its users are illegitimate.

Earlier this week Mr Musk said more of the deal will be financed by purchasing Twitter shares, rather than through debt tied to his Tesla stake. He has not said how he plans to come up with the $33.5bn in financing needed for the deal.

925,SEC Scrutinizes Musk's Initial Twitter Share Purchases,"By Sam Boughedda

Investing.com -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking over Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's disclosure of his initial stake in Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

The SEC sent a letter, dated April 4, to Musk asking why the required paperwork was not filed within the required 10 days from the date of acquisition.

It also asks Musk to address his recent public statements made on Twitter regarding the social media platform and whether it “rigorously adheres to” “free speech principles.”

The SEC requested Musk's reasoning for filing a ""13G"" form instead of a ""13D"" form. A 13G form is usually filed for investors who plan to hold a passive stake, while a 13D is for investors who plan on ""changing or influencing the control of the issuer.""

It's not the first time Musk has been in trouble with the SEC. The regulatory body sued him in 2018 following previous tweets in which he said funding was secured to potentially take Tesla private at $420 per share.

Tesla shares are up more than 6% Friday.

928,Roku Climbs on Upgrade Amid Streaming Wars,"By Liz Moyer

Investing.com -- Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) shares rose 5% on Friday after Pivotal Research raised its rating to hold from sell, saying the stock is no longer an attractive short-selling opportunity.

The streaming device maker has already forecast 2022 revenue growth of 35%, but its shares have taken a beating, down 60% this year as competition in the streaming sector escalates.

The business is ""attracting dramatically larger companies with significant leverage that are not necessarily focused on generating an economic return specifically in streaming aggregation, but as a tool to gain subscribers/sell equipment"" in other areas, said Pivotal analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak.

Pivotal has an $80 price target on the stock, which was trading around $93. It is well below its high mark of $490.76 from last July.

Cathie Wood has been adding Roku to her ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) in recent days. Roku is now one of the fund's top holdings, at 8% of the portfolio, behind Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM).

929,UPDATE 1-CATL says to supply BMW with cylindrical cell from 2025,"(Adds BMW comments)

SHANGHAI, May 27 (Reuters) - Chinese battery giant CATL on Friday said it will start supplying cylindrical cells to BMW from 2025 to power its new series of electric vehicles.

The battery maker has signed an agreement with BMW in which it is nominated as the supplier of the cylindrical cells for the German carmaker, CATL said without elaborating.

BMW declined to comment.

CATL has been supplying BMW for a decade. The Chinese firm is looking at potential battery factory sites in the United States to supply carmakers including BMW, with a goal of production beginning in 2026, Reuters reported earlier.

BMW will launch a dedicated electric platform by 2025. The German carmaker said its upcoming products will upend the perception the German carmaker is behind on electrification and make its stock compete with the likes of Tesla Inc.

It marks a rare move by CATL, which has been supplying most of its auto clients including Tesla with square cells.

Tesla recently started manufacturing its 4680 lithium-ion batteries, a cylindrical cell with 46-millimeter diameter and 80-millimeter length that can hold about five times the energy of its current smaller 2170 cells.

930,U.S. SEC looking into Musk's Twitter stake purchase,"By Pete Schroeder and Nivedita Balu

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking into Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's disclosure of his stake in Twitter Inc in early April, according to a letter the agency sent to him that month.

In the letter, now made public by the SEC, the regulator asks Musk why it appears he did not file required paperwork within 10 days of the acquisition, and also questions why, when Musk did disclose his stake, he used a form meant for passive investors while he was openly questioning Twitter's policies around free speech.

Specifically, the SEC asked Musk to explain why he opted to initially file a ""13G"" disclosure form, which is meant for investors who plan to hold their shares passively instead of a ""13D"" form, which is for activist investors who intend influence management and policies of the company. He later amended the filing. Musk was offered a board seat shortly after his initial disclosure and has since gone on to attempt to buy the company outright in a $44 billion deal to take it private.

Spokespeople for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.

Separately, Twitter said in a filing Friday it was not accepting the resignation of Egon Durban, a Musk ally, from its board. Two days earlier, Twitter shareholders had blocked his re-election, but the company said he brought ""unparalleled operational knowledge of the industry"" and instead he would reduce his board roles elsewhere.

Outside experts had previously said Musk's late filing and apparently improper paperwork could attract the attention of the SEC, which has sparred with Musk in the past.

But the financial consequences for the world's richest man could be limited, as fines for such a misstep would likely rise to a few hundred thousand dollars, according to outside experts. And others were skeptical it could endanger Musk's efforts to acquire Twitter.

Story continues

""I think from that investigation standpoint, the SEC is going to have a pretty strong case that he's violated securities laws,"" said Josh White, a finance professor at Vanderbilt University who previously worked at the SEC as a financial economist. However, he added it ""would be disastrous if [the SEC] said, well, this Twitter deal is on hold because Musk filed the wrong form.""

""Twitter stock price would instantly drop ... I don't think that the Commission has an interest in necessarily standing in the way of the deal.""

The SEC's letter is dated the same day Musk disclosed a 9.2% stake in Twitter. The billionaire has been sued by investors claiming he manipulated the company's stock price downward and profited by not disclosing his investment on time.

The Tesla Inc chief executive officer has landed in trouble with the SEC before, when the agency sued him in 2018 after he tweeted he had ""funding secured"" to potentially take the electric car company private at $420 per share. In reality, a buyout was not close.

However, Reuters has reported that the SEC has previously been reluctant to take Musk to court over perceived violations of the resulting settlement out of concern they might lose the case, and instead has opted to simply urge him to comply.

Shares of Tesla were up 5.75% in midday trading, while Twitter shares were up 2.2%.

- Now, we want to get to Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. She's at the YFi Interactive, and Ines, what do you have your eyes on today?

INES FERRER: Jared, TGIF indeed. I have my eye on these stocks that are going higher right now. We've got the Dow up 250 points on pace to end an eight a week losing streak. The S&P 500 on pace to break a seven week losing streak, and consumer discretionary is really the leader today along with technology stocks.

And just to show you the NASDAQ 100 right now, you can see the winners, Tesla up more than 2%, Amazon also higher. This is a five day chart, so you can see the gains across the board over the last five days. And then, finally, I just want to mention what's happening with some of the apparel stocks, because we have heard from some of the apparel makers this week. And we've got-- I want to show you American Eagle down 3%. This company's sales for the first quarter came in below expectations, analysts noting higher costs. This is impacting profitability, and also, inventory levels going in elevated into the second quarter. And management says, well, it's going to have to put discounts on that inventory, and of course, that's going to impact gross margins.

Also, taking a look at Urban, the stock is up right now 1.5%. Now, they had reported earlier this week a disappointing print. Morgan Stanley, today, downgrading the stock to equal weight from overweight, and also, slashing its a price target on the stock. Also, Hibbett Sports reporting its quarterly results, missing on profit estimates for the first quarter because of rising costs, and CEO Mike Longo saying something pretty interesting, saying customers' spending habits are impacted by less discretionary income.

Now, he brought up the point that you don't have stimulus. You didn't have stimulus this last quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. Right now, you can see the stock is up, but year to date, it's down about 27%. Interesting, because the stock had been under pressure in pre-market, and it's up more than 1.5% right now, guys.

- Yeah, definitely interesting stuff there in what we're seeing in retail and a little bit of a turnaround in a lot of them. Thanks so much, Ines. I appreciate it.",2022-05-27T14:21:53+00:00

JARED BLIKRE: Welcome back. Shareholders of Twitter are suing Elon Musk, as well as Twitter itself, for allegedly causing market manipulation over the course of acquisition process between Musk and Twitter. And for more on this, we're going to welcome in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan, first of all, I have to give you credit for correctly identifying the George Washington Bridge. Julie, I think we lost Dan Howley here.

JULIE HYMAN: Oh, no, did we lose Dan Howley, you guys? OK, we lost Dan Howley?

JARED BLIKRE: It happens.

JULIE HYMAN: Well, are we going to come back to Dan Howley, or should we talk about Twitter for a minute? OK, so let's talk about it. So, first of all, the--

JARED BLIKRE: Breaking news, too.

JULIE HYMAN: The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into Elon Musk's disclosure of his stake in Twitter. This is not shocking, right? I mean, he disclosed--

JARED BLIKRE: They had to.

JULIE HYMAN: They had to. Now, the question is, are they going to do anything about it? And I think there's pretty broad skepticism about their ability-- Dan, there's some pretty broad skepticism about the ability of the SEC to actually clamp down. But there's also a lawsuit in effect here for some shareholders. Do we have Dan back? There he is.

DAN HOWLEY: Yep, I'm here. Sorry about that, guys. Yes.

JULIE HYMAN: No worries.

DAN HOWLEY: There is this lawsuit that a group of shareholders are seeking to have a class action status. And essentially what they're saying is that Elon Musk has violated these California corporate laws. Part of that has to do with the timing in which he had disclosed his stake in Twitter, basically that he didn't disclose it in a timely manner, and in doing so, was able to get a discount on later stock purchases, rather than the inflated price that he may have seen if he had disclosed his initial stake earlier. That being because people would see Elon Musk buying into Twitter and then immediately think, well, we should also buy in because something is going on here. So that's part of the issue there.

But that's not the only thing that Elon Musk is dealing with. The SEC is also looking in to his disclosures in his early stake. That's according to Reuters, which had reported that a little less than an hour ago. And then obviously, we have issues with the ongoing fluctuations in share price itself. Now that's also part of this California proposed suit. They say that because of his, let's just say shenanigans, the stock price of Twitter has suffered as a result. Not so much in Tesla, but that's not part of this suit.

Him basically saying that it's on hold, that he's still dedicated to it, questioning how many bots there are, kind of talking negatively to the CEO. That, they say, is part of the larger issue that Elon Musk has with Twitter. And that seems to be their take here in this proposed suit.

There's also these comments that he continues to put out on Twitter that don't necessarily relate to this suit, but don't really look good for Twitter in general. He has put out a poll recently asking whether or not people trusted politicians more than billionaires. Obviously, Elon Musk has a ton of followers, who are, I mean, basically fanatics and voted in favor of billionaires.

You know, I don't know of two other classes that people may want to compare in that way. Most people don't trust either of them. But I do think that this is part of a larger issue with Elon Musk and Twitter here and whether or not he'll eventually acquire it. But, you know, he seems to be on track to do so. And Twitter is going to hold him to it.

JULIE HYMAN: It does seem that way. I wonder how the SEC would score on that particular poll, especially if you asked followers of Musk. Whew. All right, thanks so much, Dan Howley. Have a great weekend.",2022-05-27T15:25:43+00:00

942,Ex-SEC Lawyer Elon Musk Tried to Get Fired Heads to Robinhood,"(Bloomberg Law) -- A Big Law associate who drew the ire of Elon Musk for his prior work at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has left Cooley for an assistant general counsel position at the online trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc.

Walker Newell, a former senior counsel at the SEC, was part of an investigation of Musk that saw the self-proclaimed “technoking” of Tesla Inc. agree to a $40 million settlement. The case stemmed from tweets Musk made in 2018 about taking the electric automaker private.

Newell has reunited at Robinhood with Cheryl Crumpton, another former member of the SEC team that probed Musk and is now the company’s head of litigation, regulatory enforcement, and investigations.

The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Musk had pressured Cooley to fire an unnamed associate that the firm hired from the SEC. Three sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg Law that the associate was Newell.

The Journal said Cooley rebuffed Musk, and then Tesla and SpaceX stopped sending work to the firm and added competitors to matters already being handled by Cooley.

Musk, after publicly criticizing the Biden administration, said in a May 20 tweet said he was looking for new attorneys that are “hardcore streetfighters, not white-shoe lawyers like Perkins or Cooley who thrive on corruption.”

Cooley’s peers have praised the firm for standing up to Musk. A statement from the firm confirmed Newell’s exit on good terms to pursue an in-house opportunity.

“His departure had nothing to do with any specific client matters or demands,” Cooley said in its statement.

Newell didn’t respond to a request for comment. Robinhood declined to comment. Records on file with the State Bar of California confirm his employment with the company.

SEC Role

Newell, a former associate at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, joined the SEC in 2015. Musk, who has said he was “unlawfully” forced to settle with the SEC, is along with Tesla facing litigation from shareholders over his 2018 tweets.

Newell is not alleged to have done anything wrong during his time in public service.

His name appears on press releases issued by the SEC announcing the agency’s civil charges and subsequent settlement with Musk. In March, a federal district judge approved a distribution plan for the $20 million being paid by both Musk and Tesla.

The SEC’s case against Musk was related to tweets he made about securing funding to take Tesla private. The SEC initially sought to hold Musk in contempt of court after resolving the case before finalizing its settlement with him and Tesla in early 2019.

As Musk sought to buy Twitter Inc. in April, he unsuccessfully sought to unwind a component of that accord—that a Tesla lawyer vet his company-related tweets. He has continued to quarrel with the SEC this year, including on the disbursement of proceeds from his settlement to Tesla shareholders.

Steven Buchholz, a senior enforcement director with the SEC in San Francisco who was part of the seven-lawyer team that secured the agency’s 2018 settlement with Musk, declined to comment through a spokesperson on the technology entrepreneur’s broadsides against the regulator.

Cooley

Newell left the SEC in late 2020 for Cooley in San Francisco, where he handled litigation, investigations, cybersecurity, and blockchain-related matters.

He and another Cooley partner entered an appearance last year to represent Manish Lachwani, a co-founder and former CEO of HeadSpin Inc., who is accused of faking invoices to help the startup reach unicorn status.

Cooley had a role on nearly 5% of Tesla’s U.S. federal litigation docket since 2007, as well as more than 9% of SpaceX’s caseload in similar courts during that time, according to Bloomberg Law data.

The firm, which declined to discuss its current relationship with Musk, has advised the business mogul for more than a decade.

Michael Rhodes, a longtime Cooley partner and management committee member, has handled work for both Tesla and Twitter over the years. Rhodes represented Musk in a defamation and breach of contract lawsuit filed against him in 2009 by former Tesla co-founder and CEO Martin Eberhard. That dispute was quickly settled.

Cooley and Rhodes had also been outside counsel to Tesla in a high-profile trade secrets case the company filed against rival Rivian Automotive Inc. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan has since taken over that matter for Tesla.

Musk and Lawyers

Musk has a track record of confrontation with legal counsel. Lawyers who have previously worked closely with Musk have praised his brilliance but also cautioned about an impulsiveness that can cloud his vision.

His bid for Twitter, which Musk has said is “temporarily on hold,” has resulted in a public squabble with the company’s top lawyer, Vijaya Gadde. She ran afoul of Musk over her leadership role in labeling misinformation and suspending the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump.

Should Musk acquire Twitter—the SEC is scrutinizing his offer for the company—he’s said he would seek to reverse Trump’s permanent ban from the platform.

A thread on Reddit, an online news and social media aggregation service that sometimes serves as a forum for Big Law professionals, took note of Gadde and Musk’s May 20 tweet about Cooley and Perkins Coie, with one user jokingly noting their new favorite firm was “Perkins, Cooley & Gadde.”

Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment sent to him at Tesla, nor did the automaker’s acting general counsel David Searle. Bloomberg Law reported in March on Searle becoming the sixth in-house legal chief at Tesla since 2018.

944,3 of Nasdaq’s Most-Shorted Stocks to Buy Today,"Wall Street is up to more than just a simple squeezing of bears this week in the major averages. But if investors want added fuel in purchasing a sustainable bottom, select most-shorted stocks can provide that for smarter buy decisions.

At last the price action looks to be the real deal for investors on the hunt for bargains. The reason is a market-based follow-through day. History has shown no bull market stands a fighting chance without the key price and volume event in place.

And Thursday saw just that sort of confirmation in the Nasdaq to support a more favorable environment for purchasing stocks.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Today let’s look at three market-leading, most-shorted stocks to buy in the Nasdaq whose price charts are shaping up as we enter a less gloomy June packed with sizzling profit potential.

Ticker Company Price LCID Lucid Motors $19.78 MRNA Modern $146.76 COIN Coinbase Global $73.59

Most-Shorted Stocks to Buy: Lucid Motors (LCID) Lucid Motors (LCID) hammer undercut triple bottom pattern for LCID stock buyers

Source: Charts by TradingView

Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) is the first of our leading Nasdaq-listed, most-shorted stocks to buy.

The EV luxury play has been hailed as Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) heir apparent. That may or may not come to fruition. Still, with short interest of 27%, industry accolades and successfully putting the rubber to the road with its Lucid Dream Edition, LCID shares do have a lot in common with TSLA stock’s early days.

7 Beaten-Down Growth Stocks That Look Like Big Bargains Right Now

To be fair, Covid-driven supply chain challenges, inflation and ramping interest rates have caused some hiccups along the way such. Reduced production guidance earlier this year and the delayed launch of this most-shorted stock’s Gravity SUV have found bears steering the action with LCID stock down more than 75% this year.

Technically though, it’s time to appreciate that all trends do end and today the advantage is favoring a bullish cycle change. A bullish weekly hammer has been confirmed to complete a larger undercut, triple-bottoming formation.

Story continues

Along with favorable stochastics support, indications of a bearish move toward $10 and Lucid’s all-time-low are now in the rearview mirror and firmly replaced by expectations of a larger bullish phase in this most-shorted stock’s shares.

Moderna (MRNA) Moderna (MRNA) double bottom centered on 76% level with positive stochastics divergence

Source: Charts by TradingView

Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is the next of our most-shorted stocks to purchase, and for a couple very compelling reasons.

MRNA stock isn’t a classic heavily-shorted name. But with a market cap of $55 billion and short interest of 5.75%, shares maintain heftier bearish dollar exposure of around $3 billion and a respectable days-to-cover ratio of more than 2.5 trading sessions which can act as fuel for bullish buyers.

But Moderna has much more going for it.

The profitable, lifesaving biotech announced an extremely strong quarterly results this month and updated investors on a strong-looking product pipeline that extends beyond its Covid success. And today a purchase of this most-shorted stock is also set up for big time profit potential.

Technically, MRNA stock has reaffirmed the prior week’s double-bottom confirmation that’s formed around the 76% retracement level tied to its March 2020 Covid low. With stochastics offering a positive divergence pattern in relation to this most-shorted stock’s undercut formation, this one has the right type of Rx for buyers.

Most-Shorted Stocks to Buy: Coinbase Global (COIN) Coinbase Global (COIN) confirmed channel low in place and buyable

Source: Charts by TradingView

Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is the last of our market-leading, Nasdaq most-shorted stocks buy.

Without hesitation, North America’s largest digital currency platform has made bank for some its bearish 15% short interest. COIN stock is currently off 70% year-to-date and 84% from last April’s all-time-high print of $429.54 which occurred on its first day of trading as a public company.

7 Retirement Stocks to Buy to Turbocharge Your Savings

Moreover, a fair chunk of those losses have occurred in May with shares of this most-shorted stock down 40% and bears emboldened by a crashing crypto market and Coinbase’s much weaker than expected quarterly results.

But this is no time to kick ’em when they’re down. It’s time to buy COIN stock while the majority are warning and fleeing the scene.

Technically, this most-shorted stock has put together a confirmed inside doji weekly bottoming pattern off channel support. Coupled with a climatic post-earnings volume reaction to new lows and COIN’s stochastics now also giving the green light, buying now has rarely looked as good.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Welcome back, everyone. Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter is under added legal pressure today. A Twitter shareholder in California filed a proposed class action lawsuit against Musk and Twitter. And the SEC's probe into Musk's disclosure has also been revealed.

Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan is here with us. Alexis, what do we need to know?

ALEXIS KEENAN: Hi, Rachelle. Yes, so this is an action that is brought in California Federal Court. And it's brought by a Twitter shareholder seeking to be a class action on behalf of similarly-situated Twitter shareholders, he says.

And what the allegations here are is that it's a violation of California's Corporate Code. The lawsuit says that Musk manipulated the Twitter stock price, that is, by making false and misleading statements after he acquired that 9% share in Twitter's ownership and also that $44 billion offer that he made. The lawsuit says that Musk raised doubts about the transaction after the fact, namely in tweeting about that he has some skepticism over Twitter users and that there are too many bots on the platforms.

The lawsuit says that, no, that's not a condition of the contract that he signed to buy the company. But they said that he intentionally drove down Twitter's stock price by making that and other claims after the fact. And they said he did that to protect his Tesla shares. Remember that Musk had originally pledged some of his Tesla shares in a margin loan that he has sent scrapped. But that is one of the allegations there.

So if you look at this lawsuit, there are three counts against Musk alone. But there are also two counts against Musk and Twitter. As for Musk, they say he illegally induced shareholders to buy and sell Twitter shares, that he unjustly enriched himself, and also they make this vague insider trading accusation against Musk, saying that he bought the shares on non-public information.

Story continues

As for Twitter, they want some disclosures and claims made by the court to find that Musk's transaction is not based on those claims that he's been making on Twitter.

DAVE BRIGGS: He has driven that stock down pretty considerably. Not sure if that was his intention. But at least in recent days, it does appear he's moving towards making this deal, where the whole world thought he was getting out of it. Where does this lawsuit likely end up? And how big a threat is it?

ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, so this lawsuit makes some interesting claims, although because it's looking at accusations after Musk acquired his shares and after he already made his offer of $44 billion and had that offer accepted, it's a little bit different from your typical market manipulation claim. Usually that's like a pump-and-dump scheme. Usually that means that the manipulator is going to buy or sell based on those statements that they're making. So it's a novel case.

On the other hand, though, you had today, the SEC saying and affirming by putting a letter that they have put up on the SEC website-- there was a lot of speculation about whether the SEC was looking into some of these Twitter claims by Musk and statements that he's been making. But it turns out that, yes, they want to know more about this transaction.

And that's the issue for Musk that might be a little more high-risk, not in the dollar sense, but in the sense that it could maybe go somewhere. Maybe it has more legs. The SEC seems to have a claim there, because Musk did file his disclosure that he had acquired his Twitter shares very late.

DAVE BRIGGS: The SEC is shown no appetite to want to mess with Elon though, have they? I mean, they've had opportunities.

ALEXIS KEENAN: No.

DAVE BRIGGS: It's been a target-rich environment.

ALEXIS KEENAN: They're sprinkling in a little appetite today, because they did post this letter that they sent to Musk saying, please give us an explanation as to, one, why you filed late and, two, why you filed originally as a passive investor and not an active investor. They want to see him prove that up on paper.

DAVE BRIGGS: That seems like it has legs. And we're not even done with Elon. We got more Elon for you later in the show, because we're never done with the Elon. Alexis, thank you. Nice to see you.",2022-05-27T20:30:07+00:00

Video Transcript

- Elon Musk loves to brainstorm on Twitter, as you know. And here's his latest example. Now, Musk plans to open a 24-hour Hollywood Tesla diner, complete with drive-in movie theater, 245 foot LED movie screens, indoor, outdoor seating, and of course, 28 superchargers so you can recharge while you relax.

Now, he actually first tweeted about this back in 2018, but he submitted the documentation to the city of Los Angeles just this month. And of course, he tweeted, ""Of course, you can pay in Doge."" The man stays busy.

- It is really interesting, isn't it? Now, they're going to show 30 minute programs on a drive in theater that's long enough to charge your Tesla. What are they showing? I don't doubt Elon Musk can succeed in any category. What are they showing on these screens for 30 minutes. Is it Tesla programming? 'Cause then, I'm a hard pass.

- Yeah, it would be a hard pass. I mean, I'm very skeptical just to begin with, whether we'll actually see this come to fruition. But at a time like this, it almost seems like Elon Musk has enough going on. There's a lot of drama going on with this deal to buy Twitter.

Tesla shares have been cut in half in terms of where they were most recently trading. So maybe now is not the best time to go after what your fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth 10th business idea. But I don't know. He doesn't really show any signs of slowing down any time soon.

- You got into tequila sold out for $420 a bottle, and now you have to pay $200 just to buy the empty bottle. The guy just succeed in any platform.

- Yeah, I know. I guess I shouldn't be betting against him. He bring up like--

- Even that's where he may. He's been tweeting about launching new Starlinks in Nigeria, at different countries. So he literally has an eye on everything all at once. Hopefully, it doesn't end up translating into too much downfall for the rest of us.

- Only time will tell.",2022-05-27T21:11:12+00:00

Musk was replying to tweets after the close of his Twitter poll asking who respondents trust less -- politicians or billionaires. More than 75% said they had less trust in politicians.

959,The top 10 highest paid CEOs of the Fortune 500,"The world's richest person also received the highest CEO compensation in 2021.

Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, topped Fortune's new list of the most highly compensated CEOs on the Fortune 500.  In 2021, Musk ""realized"" compensation worth almost $23.5 billion, from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018 multiyear “moonshot” grant. That was—by far—the biggest CEO payday in 2021, according to our new analysis of how Fortune 500 CEOs are compensated.

After Musk, the 10 most highly compensated Fortune 500 CEOs of 2021 are all tech and biotech CEOs, including the heads of Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft. The full list is below.

CEO pay dwarfs that of the average employee. The average big-company CEO made 351 times the pay of the average worker on a realized basis in 2020, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), which has tracked the metric for decades, up from a 21-to-1 ratio back in 1965.

Our analysis evaluated the pay packages of 280 Fortune 500 CEOs, who earned a median total compensation of $15.9 million, up 30% from a year earlier. When calculating a CEO’s total realized pay, we measured the following for the company’s most recent fiscal year: salary and bonuses; other compensation such as vested restricted stock grants, long-term incentive payouts and perks; and stock gains in the form of value realized from exercising stock options. Because the value of unexercised options is unpredictable, we did not consider them in our tabulation of total compensation.

Here are the highest-paid CEOs.

1. Elon Musk, Tesla: $23.5 billion

Musk, the founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, ""realized"" compensation worth almost $23.5 billion in 2021, from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018.

Tesla ranked 65 on this year's Fortune 500. The company had a blockbuster 2021, bringing in $53.8 billion in revenue, up 71% from 2020, and expanding significantly into key European and Chinese markets. Tesla delivered 936,000 vehicles in 2021, an 87% increase that puts the company at the pinnacle of the global EV industry, with a 14% market share.

Story continues

Musk did not respond to Fortune's requests for comment.

2. Tim Cook, Apple: $770.5 billion

Cook has been CEO of Apple Inc. since 2011. He earned $770.5 million in 2021 alone, mostly as a part of a 10-year grant of shares worth $1.7 billion. But his incredible pay package may be justified by Apple’s stock market performance under Cook: The tech company’s market value during his tenure has increased by $2.2 trillion.

Apple ranks 3 on the Fortune 500. The company faced challenges because of the global chip shortage, but successfully began manufacturing the equipment in-house.  Apple finished the year with a gargantuan $95 billion in profits—outperforming every other U.S. company on that front.

Apple declined to comment on Fortune's analysis.

3. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA, $561 billion

Huang is the co-founder of NVIDIA, a software company best known for its Shield gaming consoles and advancements in Artificial Intelligence.

The company ranked 134 on this year's Fortune 500. Revenue surged 61.4%.

A spokesperson acknowledged that during the latest fiscal year, Huang ""realized about $507 million from expiring options that had been granted in 2011 and 2012, reflecting the approximately 60x increase in the company’s share price over the [past] decade.""

4. Reed Hastings, Netflix: $453.5 billion

Hastings is the co-founder, CEO, and chairman of the streaming giant. Under his leadership, Netflix went from a DVD mail delivery service to an online streaming heavyweight.

Netflix ranked 115 on the Fortune 500, with an 18.8% change in revenue. The company has recently cut costs after losing subscribers as the world re-opens after the pandemic. Netflix also faces increased competition from streaming services.

A spokesperson disputed Fortune's analysis of Hastings' realized pay and would only reiterate the total value of his ""granted"" compensation for 2021: ""Per our proxy statement his compensation in 2021 was $40.8 million, with $650,000 in cash and $39.7 million in stock options.""

5. Leonard Schleifer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals: $452.9 billion

Schleifer is the co-founder and CEO of Regeneron, a biopharmaceutical company that makes a variety of medications that treat asthma, cancer, chronic pain, and more.

The company ranked 231 on this year's Fortune 500. Revenue rose 89.1% in 2021, driven by the company's REGEN-COV antibody treatment for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

A spokesperson noted that the bulk of Schleifer's realized pay, per Fortune's analysis, ""reflects the exercise of long-held options that were reaching their ten-year expiration point,"" and said, ""Regeneron’s compensation philosophy has always emphasized long-term incentives in the form of stock options and other equity-based awards, as we believe this aligns employee interests with the typically long-term nature of drug development.""

6. Marc Benioff, Salesforce: $439.4 billion

Benioff founded Salesforce in 1999, adopting the marketing slogan ""The End of Software."" The cloud-based customer relationship management platform ranked 136 on this year's Fortune 500.

Salesforce's acquisitions of MuleSoft, Tableau, and Slack have helped fuel growth in recent years. Revenue rose 24.7% percent in 2021.

Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment.

7. Satya Nadella, Microsoft: $309.4 million

Many of Nadella's peers likely believe he deserves a huge payday. This year, Nadella was voted the “most underrated” CEO for the sixth consecutive year, according to the survey behind Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies. Nadella has headed that list since 2017.

Microsoft posted a robust 38% increase in profits last year—earning $61 billion, the fourth-largest sum among Fortune 500 companies—as revenue rose 17.5% to $168 billion thanks to a successful Surface laptop and tablet launch. The company, which ranked 14 on this year's 500, also grappled with a chip shortage that challenged Xbox game consoles.

Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.

8. Robert A. Kotick, Activision Blizzard: $296.7 million

Kotick became CEO of Activision in 1991. The gaming giant, best known for games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, ranked 396 on this year's Fortune 500.

Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick earned $296.7 million last year, according to our calculations, from the value realized on vested restricted stock. Despite rampant employee complaints and several lawsuits over sexism, harassment, and Kotick’s personal mismanagement of assault claims at the game developer, Microsoft in January agreed to buy Activision for $68.7 billion, in what would be its largest acquisition to date.

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson reiterated that Activision Blizzard had valued Kotick's ""granted"" (but not realized) compensation in 2021 at $826,549. She noted that Kotick had reduced his salary to $62,500 last year, and praised his 31-year tenure for making Activision “one of the most successful global gaming com- panies in the world.”

9. Hock E. Tan, Broadcom: $288 million

Tan was born in Malaysia and attended M.I.T. on a scholarship before entering the business world. He has been CEO of Broadcom since Avago's $37 billion acquisition of the semiconductor company in 2015.

Broadcom, which designs and manufactures a wide range of semiconductor and software products, ranked 128 on this year's Fortune 500. Revenue for the company rose 14.9% in 2021.

Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment.

10. Safra A. Catz, Oracle: $239.5 million

Catz was a banker before she joined Oracle as a Senior Vice President in 1999. She became co-CEO with Mark Hurd in 2014. Hurd stepped down in 2019, citing health issues, and Catz became CEO.

Oracle, which is best known for database software, has struggled in recent years with sluggish revenue growth. The company slid down 11 spots to 91 on the Fortune 500. In December 2021, Oracle announced a $28 billion deal to acquire electronic health records company Cerner; as of May 2022, that deal was still under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe.

Oracle did not respond to a request for comment.

961,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at an All-Time Low,"Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocks

Source: Shutterstock

While this year’s anxiety-fueled downturn has on the flipside generated attractive discounts for speculators, the contrarian opportunity among blue-chip stocks to buy is arguably the most enticing. Indeed, several of the alpha dogs are suffering massive losses — perhaps to an unprecedented degree. Such a circumstance gives patient investors unprecedented access to quality ideas.

Yes, you can always go after the popular names such as the meme trades and other flavors of the week. However, with myriad blue-chip stocks to buy suffering sizable double-digit losses in the year so far, even the most conservative investor should at least consider picking up a few shares. After all, the companies with the biggest market capitalization stats earned the premium through years of business success.

The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for June 2022

Therefore, the concept of picking up blue-chip stocks to buy during these volatile times is less about speculation and more about advantaging what the market is giving you. Don’t get me wrong — nothing in the capital markets is without risk. However, the blue chips have proven themselves and, therefore, you’re acquiring good companies suffering from lean business cycles.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Ticker Company Current Price NVDA Nvidia $186.22 INTU Intuit $417.36 TGT Target $163.99 TTD Trade Desk $50.87 TWLO Twilio $103.92 DPZ Domino’s Pizza $359.83 TSLA Tesla $743.78

Nvidia (NVDA)

One of the biggest names in the broader technology space, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is presently suffering through a sharp reversal of fortune. On a year-to-date basis, NVDA is down nearly 40%. Generally speaking, when an equity unit loses that much value in the market, there’s a reason for it — typically not a good one. Admittedly, the red ink is a major distraction.

As you know, the semiconductor supply crunch has been the poster child of the global supply chain crisis. In addition, the cryptocurrency market has cratered thus far, imposing a headwind on one of Nvidia’s lucrative revenue channels: manufacturing processors geared specifically for crypto-mining operations. Piling on top of this mess is soaring inflation, crimping consumer budgets.

Story continues

Still, inflation, the crypto fallout and the supply chain crisis are temporary issues. That doesn’t mean they’ll go away tomorrow. It may take years to resolve. But at some point, a resolution will likely arrive. But, by then, NVDA could be priced back up to its rightful premium, meaning that it’s possibly one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy now.

Intuit (INTU)

A powerhouse in the business software industry, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is best known for its tax preparation solutions, including popular brands TurboTax and QuickBooks. Now, I understand that for most folks, tax season is over. But that’s no reason why INTU should be down 33% YTD.

One possible explanation for the dramatic red ink is the economic backdrop. With consumer sentiment hitting multi-year lows amid a number of companies announcing layoffs, the financial picture for many households looks bleak. To put it cynically, it might not be necessary for folks to consider buying access to tax software due to the collective erosion of wages and income.

7 Growth Stocks That Are Screaming Buys on Sale

Still, on a more optimistic note, Intuit could rise as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy thanks to the burgeoning gig economy. Projected to be a $455 billion market segment by 2023, Intuit stands poised to serve new customers; bear in mind that independent contractors feature a more complex tax profile than regular employees.

Target (TGT)

Target (NYSE:TGT) is down big, shedding over 29% YTD. Of course, the security wasn’t performing that poorly until recently, when management disclosed its results for the first quarter of 2022. Obviously, the picture stunk.

Although revenue at $25.17 billion exceeded the consensus target of $24.49 billion, Target slipped badly in terms of earnings-per-share, delivering $2.19 adjusted against the estimate of $3.07. Management explained the poor numbers, stating that it struggled against pricey freight costs, higher markdowns and lower-than-anticipated sales from discretionary items.

In other words, the consumer sentiment index isn’t just a wonky statistic. People are feeling the pain and they’re closing their wallets.

Nevertheless, the saving grace for Target is that it has strong appeal, unlike rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has a less-than-ideal image. Plus, Target caters to a wealthier shopper, affording it some insulation in case of a recession.

Trade Desk (TTD)

When social media firm Snap (NYSE:SNAP) warned that it likely would not be able to meet its revenue and profit forecasts for Q2 because of economic deterioration, Wall Street punished SNAP stock to a hideous degree, shedding 43% on the May 24 session. But as Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) demonstrated, it wasn’t the only victim.

While TTD didn’t hurt as much, the pain was quite a conspicuous affair, dropping 18.5% on May 24, translating to an outright hemorrhaging of almost 43% YTD. Although the two are different companies (obviously), Snap’s worrying disclosure imparted negative implications on digital media and advertising. Being a leader in the programmatic advertising space, the potential industry headwind shook up Trade Desk.

7 Best Auto Stocks to Buy in June

Although not taking anything away from the inherent risks, TTD could still make a case for blue-chip stocks to buy because programmatic advertising may be the future of consumer engagement. Experts project that the underlying market could expand at a compound annual growth rate of 13.7%, potentially making TTD an enticing discount.

Twilio (TWLO)

One of the companies I didn’t give much credence to during its ascendency, it looks like I’m batting zero for two regarding Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Previously, I’ve spoken about the contrarian prospects of TWLO. Unfortunately, the equity unit keeps moving in the wrong direction, printing a stunning loss of 60% YTD. I should call it quits, but I’m going to stick my neck out at least one more time.

As a specialist in communications APIs — or interfaces that facilitate the embedding of voice calling, text messages and other forms of communication into a software application or product — Twilio is extraordinarily relevant. With modern societies almost guaranteed to integrate more digitalization and automation protocols, Twilio almost seems like a no-brainer discount.

In addition, I really dig the company’s two-factor authentication (2FA) system, which carries relevance for the crypto investing community. While no safety protocol is 100% guaranteed, 2FA provides significant peace of mind for those worried about cyberbreaches.

Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

In many cases, recessionary pressures help so-called vice stocks because their underlying products provide cheap entertainment or a form of escapism from contemporary troubles. That’s the cynical case for Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ). No, the company isn’t a culinary specialist. Instead, it delivers reasonably priced comfort food to hungry households, making it one of the more interesting blue-chip stocks to buy on discount.

And what a discount it is. Despite Domino’s much-heralded corporate turnaround, DPZ this year isn’t showing much evidence of it, dropping 35% YTD. In my view, the skyrocketing inflation rate is a significant detractor. Because of the associated erosion of purchasing power, financially strapped folks will look for ways to save money. Eating out will be an easy item to cross off the list.

7 Stock Picks That Are Killing It Despite the Dicey Economy

Nevertheless, there’s a question about whether the selloff is a bit too steep. Again, Domino’s has a bit of a vice appeal because of its addictive fast-food business. Therefore, it might be one of the blue-chip stocks to buy for forward-thinking speculators.

Tesla (TSLA)

One of the biggest winners from the doldrums of 2020 — when shares traded in double-digit territory — Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has defied critics, eventually crossing over into four-digit territory. The ride has been nothing short of remarkable. Unfortunately, what goes up must come down. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk is learning, he can buy a lot of things but not control of gravity.

But it’s not just the normal ebb and flow of the market that’s impacting TSLA. Rather, strong questions are rising about the viability of electric vehicles, particularly for the middle-income masses. For one thing, EVs are still incredibly expensive and two, the necessary lithium extraction process that undergirds the industry is environmentally taxing, particularly on global water supplies.

But what I like about Tesla from a cynical perspective is that the products cater to a somewhat exclusive and generally affluent consumer base. I’m beginning to doubt that Tesla will ever be accessible to regular-income folks, but that might be okay. Exclusivity can generate social cachet, which could make TSLA one of the blue-chip stocks to buy on discount.

963,Barbara Corcoran on Elon Musk: 'I’d like to zip him in a Ziploc bag',"Real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran didn't mince words when asked about Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's recent behavior.

""I'd like to zip him in a Ziploc bag and try to get his ego stuffed inside and calm him down,"" the ""Shark Tank"" investor told Yahoo Finance in an interview (video above). ""He's a bit much lately. I liked him better who he was than who he is lately.""

Musk offered to buy Twitter (TWTR) for nearly $44 billion, or $54.20 per share, on April 14. The social media platform agreed to a deal on April 25th.

But on May 13, the world's richest man on paper claimed the deal was ""on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users."" A few days later, Musk responded to a tweet thread from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal with a poop emoji.

Twitter stock lost nearly all gains since the company disclosed Musk's initial 9.2% stake in the company on April 4, and Tesla stock also sunk more than the broader market recently.

Late Wednesday night, Twitter investors — led by Virginia resident William Heresniak — filed a lawsuit against him, alleging the billionaire executive engaged ""in conduct designed to create doubt about the deal and drive Twitter’s stock down substantially in order to create leverage.""

""Twitter has lost $8 billion in valuation since the buyout was announced,"" the suit alleges.

The suit also claims Musk failed to timely disclose his stake in the company under SEC law, and thus ""bought Twitter stock at an artificially low price.""

The lawsuit comes as a new SEC filing revealed Musk is planning to front $33.5 billion of his own wealth to take over the social media company, although many observers aren't convinced the deal will be completed at the initial $44 billion bid, if at all.

Twitter's Agrawal suggested the deal was still moving forward at the company's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday, saying: ""We are working through the transaction process.""

Corcoran previously sung the praises of Musk during a January 2020 interview with Yahoo Finance, describing him as a ""winner.""

Story continues

Musk is ""rough, but let me tell you, any great leader is rough,"" she said at the time. ""Any great leader has a strong opinion and isn't so smooth on the edges and drives it home. ... But that's what you want when you want to reinvent a category, and that's what he's done.""

In the latest interview, Corcoran joked that ""I'm hoping he gets simmered down — he needs a good woman and put him in his place.""

A new prompt — called ""seeds"" — is posted within each community every day, where Somewhere Good users can respond to them individually, snowballing into ""conversations"" branching off between customers from there. This is similar to Twitter's (TWTR) Spaces feature.

However, Austin stressed how her platform will be very different from Twitter and other social media networks where online discord can create toxic digital environments.

AGL Energy Ltd. abandoned a plan to split its retail and power-generation assets -- and said its chief executive officer and chairman will exit -- after pressure from technology tycoon Mike Cannon-Brookes, who became the utility’s largest shareholder this month to hasten efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

The firm’s proposal, which had been scheduled to be voted on within weeks, would have seen Australia’s biggest electricity generator run its coal-fired plants for another two decades, and anticipated the power business would not hit net zero emissions until about 2047.

Cannon-Brookes has argued that the coal plants should be closed far sooner, and that splitting AGL in two would destroy value and give the new companies less ability to pursue a quick transition to cleaner energy. AGL is Australia’s largest emitter of scope-one greenhouse gases.

AGL declined 1.7% in Sydney trading Monday, reflecting concern over the company’s prospects as it seeks new leadership and a fresh plan for the future. The shares have plunged by more than two-thirds from an April 2017 high.

“There is now less certainty as to the future direction of AGL,” said Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments and capital markets at Van Eck Associates Corp., which owns the utility’s shares. “The risk of further downside has increased.”

Read more: How Australia Is Transforming Grids Away From Coal Power

Cannon-Brookes, who has used his wealth and social media following to lobby lawmakers and Elon Musk on climate action, earlier this year joined a failed takeover approach for AGL led by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. He resumed his campaign this month by taking control of about 11% of the Sydney-based utility, plunging the company into new turmoil.

Story continues

CEO Graeme Hunt and Chairman Peter Botten will leave their posts, along with two other board members, AGL said Monday. The company will also launch a strategic review, consult with investors including Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures and listen to “any new approaches from third parties regarding alternative transactions,” it said.

AGL, formed in 1837 as the Australian Gas Light company, also indicated it could accelerate an exit from coal.

Grok will seek board seats and believes AGL’s decision shows investors agree with Cannon-Brookes that the utility “needs to be kept together to take advantage of the economic opportunity presented by decarbonization,” it said in a statement.

The AGL decision highlights renewed attention being given to the pace of climate action in Australia following the vote into power last week of a new government -- and a slew of emissions-focused independent lawmakers -- that has vowed to end decades of inaction by one of the world’s highest per-capita emitters.

It also builds on activist fund Engine No. 1’s surprise success last year in having three climate-conscious directors voted onto the board of Exxon Mobil Corp., and Enkraft Capital’s move to force German energy giant RWE AG to hold a vote on a spinoff of its brown coal operations.

AGL had intended to ask holders to vote next month to approve the creation of AGL Australia, a retailer with more than 4 million energy customers, and Accel Energy, which would operate the aging fleet of coal plants and develop capacity in renewables. The firm expected its final coal plant to close between 2040 and 2045.

“Shareholders are increasingly expecting companies to do more to drive a timely, equitable and orderly transition to a low-carbon future,” said Debby Blakey, CEO of Health Employees Superannuation Trust Australia, one of the country’s largest pension funds and an AGL investor that opposed the demerger.

Cannon-Brookes most famously demonstrated his interest in accelerating clean energy in 2017 when he challenged Tesla Inc.’s Musk to install 100 megawatts of battery power within 100 days to help solve an energy crisis in South Australia. Musk took up the offer, won the bet, and helped spark a rush of giant battery projects.

AGL aims to report to shareholders on its review in September and will provide an update on progress with its next earnings results, it said.

969,FOCUS-How a cheap component could help kill off combustion cars,"By Nick Carey and Christina Amann

LONDON/BERLIN, May 30 (Reuters) - The humble wire harness, a cheap component that bundles cables together, has become an unlikely scourge of the auto industry. Some predict it could hasten the downfall of combustion cars.

Supplies of the auto part were choked by the war in Ukraine, which is home to a significant chunk of the world's production, with wire harnesses made there fitted in hundreds of thousands of new vehicles every year.

These low-tech and low-margin parts - made from wire, plastic and rubber with lots of low-cost manual labour - may not command the kudos of microchips and motors, yet cars can't be built without them.

The supply crunch could accelerate the plans of some legacy auto firms to switch to a new generation of lighter, machine-made harnesses designed for electric vehicles, according to interviews with more than a dozen industry players and experts.

""This is just one more rationale for the industry to make the transition to electric quicker,"" said Sam Fiorani, head of production forecasting firm AutoForecast Solutions.

Gasoline cars still account for the bulk of new car sales globally; EVs doubled to 4 million last year, but still only comprised 6% of vehicle sales, according to data from JATO Dynamics.

Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida told Reuters that supply-chain disruptions such as the Ukraine crisis had prompted his company to talk to suppliers about shifting away from the cheap-labour wire harness model.

In the immediate term, though, automakers and suppliers have shifted harness production to other lower-cost countries.

Mercedes-Benz was able to fly in harnesses from Mexico to plug a brief supply gap, according to a person familiar with its operations. Some Japanese suppliers are adding capacity in Morocco, while others have sought new production lines in countries including Tunisia, Poland, Serbia and Romania.

THE TESLA MODEL

Harnesses for fossil-fuel cars bundle together cables stretching up to 5 km (3.1 miles) in the average vehicle, connecting everything from seat heaters to windows. They are labour-intensive to make, and almost every model's is unique, so shifting production is hard to do quickly.

Story continues

The supply disruptions in Ukraine were a rude awakening for the auto industry. Carmakers and suppliers said that early in the war, plants remained open only thanks to the determination of workers there, who kept a reduced flow of parts moving in the face of power cuts, air-raid warnings and curfews.

Adrian Hallmark, CEO of Bentley, said the British luxury carmaker had initially feared losing 30-40% of its car production for 2022 due to a harness shortage.

""The Ukraine crisis threatened to close our factory fully for several months, much longer than we did for COVID.""

Hallmark said finding alternative production sources was complicated by the fact the conventional harnesses themselves had 10 different parts from 10 different suppliers in Ukraine.

He added that the supply problems had sharpened Bentley's focus and investment on developing a simple harness for EVs that will be run by a central computer. The carmaker, a division of Volkswagen, plans a fully-electric lineup by 2030.

""The Tesla model, which is a completely different concept of wiring, we couldn't change to that overnight,"" Hallmark added. ""It's a fundamental change in the way that we design cars.""

The new generation of wire harnesses, used by electric natives like Tesla, can be made in sections on automated production lines and are lighter, a key factor because reducing an EV's weight is crucial for extending range.

Many of the executives and experts interviewed said fossil-fuel cars, which face looming bans in Europe and China, would not be around long enough to justify redesigns to allow them to use next-generation harnesses.

""I wouldn't put a penny into internal combustion engines now,"" said Michigan-based auto consultant Sandy Munro, who estimates EVs will make up half of global new car sales by 2028.

""The future is coming up awful fast.""

'CHANGE OF PARADIGM'

Walter Glück, head of Leoni's harness business, said the supplier was working with carmakers on new, automated solutions for wire harnesses in EVs.

Leoni is focusing on zonal or modular harnesses, which would be split into six to eight parts, short enough for automation in assembly and reducing complexity.

""It's a change of paradigm,"" Glück said. ""If you want to reduce production time in your car factory, a modular wire harness helps.""

Among automakers, BMW is also looking at using modular wire harnesses, requiring fewer semiconductors and less cable, which would save space and make them lighter, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

The person, who declined to be named as they not authorized to speak publicly, said the new harnesses would also make it easier to upgrade vehicles wirelessly - an area Tesla now dominates.

CelLink, a Californian-based startup, has developed an entirely automated, flat and easy-to-install ""flex harness"", and raised $250 million earlier this year from companies including BMW and auto suppliers Lear Corp and Robert Bosch .

CEO Kevin Coakley would not identify customers but said CelLink's harnesses had been installed in close to a million EVs.

Only Tesla has that scale, but the carmaker did not respond to a request for comment.

Coakley said CelLink's new $125 million factory under construction in Texas will have 25 automated production lines which will be able switch different designs in around 10 minutes because the components are produced from digital files.

The company is working on EVs with a number of carmakers and looking at building another plant in Europe, he said.

While the lead time for changing a conventional wire harness can be up to 26 weeks, Coakley said his company could ship redesigned products in two weeks.

That kind speed is what legacy carmakers are looking for as they go electric, said Dan Ratliff, a principal at Detroit-based venture capital firm Fontinalis Partners, which was founded by Ford Chairman Bill Ford and has invested in CelLink.

For decades, the industry has not needed to move fast to rethink a part like the wire harness, but Tesla has changed that, Ratliff added.

970,Who Is Tech Tycoon-Turned Climate Activist Mike Cannon-Brookes,"(Bloomberg) -- Atlassian Corp. co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes’s day job has catapulted him up the Bloomberg Billionaires Index since the software firm’s US listing in 2015. It’s what he calls his night and weekend work that’s turned him into a climate crusader.

The campaign by Australia’s fourth-richest person to halt the breakup of utility AGL Energy Ltd. is just one of a raft of initiatives and investments he’s launched in recent years intended to speed up action to curb emissions, and aimed at seizing opportunities as the world decarbonizes.

What has his career involved?

The 42-year-old set up Atlassian, a supplier of work-collaboration software, with friend Scott Farquhar after graduating from university, funding it with credit cards, so that -- Cannon-Brookes has claimed -- he’d never have to wear a suit to work. The Sydney-based firm went public in New York in Dec. 2015. Cannon-Brookes remains co-chief executive officer and is chairman of Australian investment firm Blackbird Ventures.

How has he campaigned for climate action?

Cannon-Brookes’s activism came into public view in 2017 when he challenged Elon Musk via Twitter to help fix power failures in South Australia by installing a 100 megawatt Tesla Inc. battery plant -- at the time the world’s largest -- and do it within 100 days, or complete the work for free. The project’s success is seen as having strengthened the case for wider adoption of energy storage batteries.

With iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest, Cannon-Brookes signed up to an early investment round in Sun Cable -- a A$30 billion ($21.9 billion) project which aims to export solar power from Australia’s Outback to Singapore via a 2,600-mile high-voltage undersea cable.

Story continues

He previously tangled with former Prime Minister Scott Morrison over Australia’s commitment to renewables, and also backed plans to create one million jobs in green energy in the nation.

Is AGL his first activist campaign?

In 2019, his personal office Grok Ventures joined other investors in BHP Group in demanding the world’s top miner suspend ties with industry groups seen as hindering climate change goals.

Earlier this year, Grok joined a A$20 billion Brookfield Asset Management-led takeover offer for AGL, which was rejected. The partners planned to quickly replace coal plants with clean energy and storage capacity, enabling the utility to hit net zero emissions by 2035.

Is he likely to go after other companies?

It’s possible, as Australia has other major polluters that have been criticized for a laggard approach on emissions reduction.

Grok has also invested in firms including home energy efficiency company Sealed, plant-based meat alternative producer Fable Food Pty. and solar technology developer SunDrive Solar.

Cannon-Brookes has pledged to give A$1.5 billion directly to climate causes.

What else does he invest in?

He’s bought up luxury real estate across his home state of New South Wales, including multiple waterfront mansions in Sydney.

Other notable corporate investments have been in sporting clubs. Cannon-Brookes is a minority owner of Utah Jazz basketball club and purchased a stake in the South Sydney Rabbitohs, making him one of the rugby league team’s most prominent supporters, alongside actor Russell Crowe and Australia’s new PM Anthony Albanese.

971,Tesla Shanghai plant restores weekly output to 70% of pre-lockdown level -sources,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has restored weekly output at its Shanghai plant to nearly 70% of the level which it had operated at before the city's COVID-19 lockdown, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The U.S. automaker, which added a second shift of workers in the middle of last week, is expected to increase output further this week, said the people, who declined to be named as the matter is private.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bringing production back to pre-lockdown levels has been a challenge for Tesla at the Shanghai plant, known as Gigafactory 3, amid the ongoing lockdown of the Chinese economic hub which forced the factory to shut for 22 days.

While the city government had given Tesla significant help to reopen, the company had battled numerous obstacles such as insufficient workers as well as logistics problems that impacted the supplies of parts, including wire harnesses.

This forced it on many occasions to delay plans to reopen or increase output and even halt most of its production at the plant at one point.

After reopening on April 19, the Tesla factory produced 10,757 vehicles by the end of April, selling 1,512 of them, data released by the China Passenger Car Association showed.

That compared to 65,814 cars sold in March and marked the lowest sales tally since April 2020, four months after the factory started delivering China-made cars.

Shanghai authorities will cancel many conditions for businesses to resume work from Wednesday, a city official said on Sunday, as it looks to start lifting city-wide lockdown that began some two months ago and will also introduce policies to support its battered economy.

Its efforts to spur consumption included adding 40,000 car ownership quotas for the year and subsidising people who exchange their old combustion engine vehicles for battery-powered electric cars.

The move came after Premier Li Keqiang held a key meeting last week during which he urged local authorities to take measures to spur economic growth in the second quarter and stem rising unemployment after the country's stringent zero-COVID movement restrictions disrupted production and damped consumption in many parts of the country.

973,"Tesla's Shanghai factory adds back second shift, restoring manufacturing capacity to level before citywide lockdown: sources","Tesla has put two shifts back into operation at its factory in Shanghai, restoring manufacturing capacity to the level before local authorities imposed a citywide lockdown on April 1 to combat an outbreak of Covid-19.

The Gigafactory 3, also known as Giga Shanghai, is once again able to assemble about 2,600 electric vehicles a day, according to two industry officials with knowledge of the plant's status who declined to be named as they are not authorised to talk with the media.

This follows weeks of single shift ""closed loop"" operations at the factory, whereby workers had to sleep on site to avoid contact with outsiders and be tested daily for possible Covid-19 infection.

The Giga Shanghai has been running with two shifts a day since late last week, according to the people familiar, after the US carmaker secured support from local authorities, the necessary components from its vendors and arranged enough space to quarantine workers before they returned to the factory.

Before it resumed a two-shift operation at the Shanghai factory, Tesla isolated many workers in disused factories and an old military camp to ensure they were free of Covid-19, Bloomberg reported last week.

David Zhang, a researcher at the North China University of Technology, said that while a single shift operation at the Giga Shanghai could churn out up to 1,400 vehicles per day, an additional shift can boost daily output to between 2,600 to 2,800 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles every 24 hours.

""It still depends on how the factory arranges its manpower and facilities,"" said Zhang. ""The plant can be quite efficient in production as long as the supply chain issue is resolved.""

Tesla declined to comment on the matter on Monday.

Story continues

Tesla co-founder and chief executive Elon Musk praised Chinese factory workers for pulling extreme hours during an online interview with the Financial Times earlier this month.

""They won't just be burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3am oil, they won't even leave the factory type of thing, whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all,"" said Musk in the interview.

""I think there will be very strong companies coming out from China. There are a lot of super-talented, hardworking people in China who strongly believe in manufacturing,"" the tech billionaire was quoted as saying.

Tesla has lost about 50,000 vehicles in production due to reduced shifts at Giga Shanghai between March 28 and April 18 amid the Covid-19 outbreak and city lockdowns. Shanghai started a phased lockdown on March 28 by shutting down Pudong, east of the Huangpu River, before it locked down the whole city on April 1.

The factory, located in Pudong's Lingang free-trade zone and connected to Yangshan Deep-Water Port by the Donghai Bridge, could only run a single shift initially due to a shortage of components, which limited output to about 1,000 vehicles a day - only half the plant's normal daily output.

In April, the US carmaker delivered only 1,500 vehicles to mainland customers, about 98 per cent fewer than a month earlier, according to data provided by the China Passenger Car Association.

The boom in electric vehicle stocks is only set to accelerate.

Global leaders want millions of EVs on the road. Major automakers are switching from combustion to electric. Global sales are on the rise. In fact, according to Car and Driver contributor Sebastian Blanco:

American car shoppers seem to have discovered the electric car. After a decade of slow but steady sales growth, electric vehicle registrations in the U.S. shot up 60 percent in the first quarter of 2022 even as overall new car registrations dropped 18 percent. It’s the latest indication that domestic EV acceptance may have turned some important but invisible corner recently.

We also have to remember that President Joe Biden wants at least 50% of all new vehicles to be electric by 2030. To help, the administration is investing $3 billion to spur domestic production of EV batteries.

7 Beaten-Down Growth Stocks That Look Like Big Bargains Right Now

While electric vehicle stocks have pulled back — thanks to a broad market pullback — I’d use weakness as a long-term opportunity. In fact, here are a few you may want to consider today.

Nio (NYSE:NIO) is one of the absolute top electric vehicles stocks to own.

While it’s had its share of issues, including Covid-19, supply chain issues, lower monthly deliveries, and Chinese government lockdowns, don’t write the stock off just yet. Even Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh is still confident in the stock, with a “Buy” rating and a price target of $60. The analyst believes the Nio’s production and supply chain issues are starting to improve, and that the company could be back to pre-shutdown levels by June.

Bank of America analyst Ming Hsun Lee also upgraded the beaten down EV stock to a buy rating, with a price target of $26. All thanks to improving sales and the potential for better margins in the second half of the year. She also says the pullback has “likely priced in all negatives,” as quoted by The Fly.

Even better, the company is now list on three exchanges, including in New York, Hong Kong, and now Singapore.

Weakness in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock may be an opportunity, too. After failing at triple top around $1,200, the EV stock now sits at double bottom support dating back to April. From a current price of $646, I’d eventually like to see TSLA again challenge $1,200 over the long-term. It’s also technically oversold on relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), and Williams’ %R.

Also, even with supply chain challenges, the company still managed to deliver 321,048 EVs in the first quarter of 2022. Granted, deliveries in the current quarter could be low, with China still struggling with the pandemic and lockdowns. But don’t write the stock off. The long-term outlook for TSLA deliveries is still strong.

Even better, there’s a potential stock split nearing. In fact, if shareholders approve the split at the August 2 annual meeting, the stock could take off. The last time the TSLA stock split, “shares rose more than 60% in the two and a half weeks between the announcement and the actual split,” as noted by Barron’s contributor Al Root.

Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI) is another hot EV stock I’d buy on weakness.

Much like NIO, Li Auto could see a strong comeback once the coronavirus, and supply chain issues cool off. The company also just posted stronger than expected earnings, with an earnings per share (EPS) of 3 cents a share on sales of $1.5 billion. The Street was looking for a loss of 7 cents on sales of about $1.4 billion. Plus, gross profit margins were just about flat, quarter over quarter.

Moving forward, Li Auto expects to deliver between 21,000 and 24,000 EVs in the second quarter. It also expects to see sales of about $1 billion for the quarter. In addition, according to Li Auto CEO Xiang Li:

Despite recent pandemic-related bumps on the road, we are forging ahead with our plan to commence the deliveries of our second model, the L9, in the third quarter…

The L9 is a flagship smart SUV for family users based on our new-generation EREV platform, offering best-in-class performance, safety, and intelligence.

About a year ago, General Motors (NYSE:GM) said it would invest $35 billion in electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles through 2025.

In fact, as the company noted in a June 2021 press release:

GM first shared its vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion nearly four years ago. Key factors changing the landscape include strong public reaction to the GMC HUMMER EV and HUMMER EV SUV, the Cadillac LYRIQ and the Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup; GM and dealer investments in the EV customer experience; public and private investment in EV charging infrastructure; and the global policy environment.

One of the best ways to trade the boom in electric vehicle stocks is with an ETF, such as the iShares Self Driving EV and Tech ETF (NYSE: IDRV). Not only does the ETF allow us to diversify with top EV and related technology stocks, it allows us to gain access at less cost.

If I were to buy 100 shares of the IDRV ETF today, it would cost me $3,992, and I’d gain exposure to stocks, such as Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to name a few. If I were to buy 100 shares of just TSLA, it would cost me $64,300. With the ETF, I can own more for less.

Another solid EV ETF to consider is the Global X Autonomous and Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV).

With an expense ratio of 0.68%, this ETF offers exposure to Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to name a few.

Finally, investors may want to consider BYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF).

Backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), the Chinese car and battery company has now shifted to battery electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid EVs. Sales have been impressive, too. In April, the company delivered 57,403 battery EVs, which was p about 270% year over year. It also produced about 57,593 BEVs.

In addition, the company recently said net income jumped 241% year-over-year to $123 million, or 808.4 million yuan. That was at the higher end of guidance for 650 million to 950 million yuan. Sales were up 63% to 66.8 billion yuan.

In its preliminary first-quarter earnings, BYD Company touted its successes:

The sales volume of new energy vehicles of the Group also reached a record high, with market share continuing to increase, achieving rapid year-on-year growth, which led to a significant improvement in profitability and, to a certain extent, offset the profitability pressure brought by the rise in upstream raw material prices

976,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know","Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Shares of this electric car maker have returned -12.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has lost 11.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Tesla is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +46.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.7%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.18 points to a change of +64.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.48 indicates a change of +20.6% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +105.9%.

Story continues

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TSLA _12MonthEPSChartUrl

Revenue Growth Forecast

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

In the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $18.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +55.5%. The $85.77 billion and $113.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +59.4% and +31.8%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Tesla reported revenues of $18.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +80.5%. EPS of $3.22 for the same period compares with $0.93 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.57%. The EPS surprise was +49.77%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Tesla is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

977,Jim Simons’ Portfolio in 2022: Top 10 Stock Picks,"In this article, we discuss the top 10 stock picks of Jim Simons' 2022 portfolio. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Simons' stock picks and hedge fund history, go directly to Jim Simons' Portfolio in 2022: Top 5 Stock Picks.

Jim Simons founded Renaissance Technologies in 1978, and is often referred to as 'the most successful hedge fund manager of all time'. The 84 year old has a long and illustrious career on Wall Street and beyond, initially starting his journey as a mathematics genius. He received a Bachelor's degree from MIT in 1958, and a PhD in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley at the age of 23. His hedge fund utilizes quantitative, mathematical models and algorithms to make investments that benefit from market inefficiencies. It runs three funds that are open to the public, namely the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF), Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equity Fund. But its star performer is the Medallion Fund, which is only open to the fund's employees and their family members. It has averaged net returns of 39.1% from the period between 1988 and 2018, earning over $100 billion in profits.

In January 2022, Bloomberg reported that Renaissance Technologies had seen outflows of nearly $15 billion in the previous 14 months, a trend which started with the fund's poor performance in 2020. This was because the Medallion Fund, not available for public investors, returned 76% in the year, while the three public funds posted losses of 19%, 31%, and 31%. The discrepancy led investors to slowly pull their money out of Simons' fund, and its current portfolio stands at $85.21 billion as of the first quarter of 2022, down from $92 billion as of December 2020. The billionaire recently added 828 new stocks to his portfolio, made additional purchases in 1,564, whilst selling off 656 stocks and reducing stakes in 1,631 equities. The fund's top 10 holdings represent 12.02% of its total portfolio, which includes big names such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), along with others mentioned below.

On April 29, Truist analyst Youssef Squali maintained a 'Buy' rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares, but reduced the price target to $3,500 from $4,000, on the back of emerging cost pressures and normalizing e-commerce demand which the analyst thinks will put the company in a ""rough patch"" in Q2. However, he remains positive on the company shares given the strong growth in Amazon Web Services and Advertising, as well as the prospects for inflationary pressure.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was the most popular stock holding of the 929 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, with 279 bullish bets on the company shares. The combined value of these positions stood at $49.16 billion.

“Jeff Bezos sums up the current market behavior well in his 2000 shareholder letter where he quoted Benjamin Graham’s famous statement that, in the short term, a stock market is a voting machine, while in the long term, it is a weighing machine, saying that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a “company that wants to be weighed, and over time we will be – over the long term, all companies are. In the meantime, we have our heads down working to build a heavier and heavier company.”

We have a lot of conviction that our businesses are doing the same – working to build heavier and heavier companies.”

Artisan Partners, an investment firm, talked about Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) in its Q1 2021 investor letter. Here's what the fund said:

“We concluded our campaigns in Zoom Video Communications. We have been paring our position in Zoom for several quarters, anticipating the reduced need for video conferencing as vaccination rates climb and people return to their workplaces. That said, we believe there is a strong case to be made that the pandemic has prompted a permanent inflection in videoconferencing’s importance—sustainably higher remote work arrangements, more online learning and less business travel. Furthermore, the company’s dramatically expanded user base (up 485% YoY in Q3) positions it well to cross sell additional services, Zoom Phone in particular. The long-term future remains bright, but we decided to end our successful investment campaign in favor of opportunities in our pipeline with more attractive near-term growth prospects.”

“The structural bucket has the shortest investment horizon across the spectrum of growth companies we target in the Strategy. We closely monitor the macro impacts and turnaround progress of these companies and will be disciplined sellers when the thesis for a holding plays out. We also trimmed back workflow software maker Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) after a strong runup in its shares in 2021. Most of our reductions in emerging growth have involved IT or related companies where innovation is a key to their business model. That said, we remain positive on the IT sector and have largely maintained holdings in our highest-conviction ideas.”

Renaissance Technologies' Stake Value: $777.11 millionPercentage of Renaissance Technologies’ 13F Portfolio: 0.91%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69

The California-based semiconductor firm develops processing chips and graphic cards for a range of computer devices around the world. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Reporting its first quarter earnings on May 3, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) posted EPS of $1.13, which was above estimates by $0.20. The company raked in $5.89 billion in revenue for the quarter, which represented an increase of 70.9% over the same period last year, and outperformed estimates by $313.4 million.

“Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) supplies semiconductor chips for central processing units (CPUs) and graphic processing units (GPUs). The firm has been gaining share against its primary competitor in the datacenter server CPU space, as this rival has been unable to match the design and manufacturing capabilities of AMD and its partners. Investors are also looking forward to the closing of the previously announced merger with a semiconductor manufacturer that is another one of the portfolio’s holdings. The merger will increase AMD’s capabilities in the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip space, and the combined company should possess the potential to win additional market share in the datacenter chip market.”

She noted that the firm's latest quarterly results signaled an uptick in demand for its products and services, although uncertainty in China led to increased supply-chain issues.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted EPS of $1.52 for the first quarter, beating consensus estimates by $0.09. The company's revenue for the quarter was recorded at $97.3 billion, and outperformed estimates by $3.3 billion.

ClearBridge Investments, an investment firm, mentioned many stocks in its Q4 2021 investor letter, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them. The fund said:

“Despite these mixed emerging growth results, the ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy outperformed the benchmark due to resilience among our secular and structural growth holdings. The bulk of these contributions came from U.S. mega-cap growth stocks Apple and Microsoft which continued to uniquely act both offensively and defensively as they have through most of the pandemic.”

978,"What Tesla CEO Elon Musk gets wrong about ESG, according to Dave Nadig","The S&P benchmark environmental, social, and governance (ESG) index dropped Tesla (TSLA) recently, leading Elon Musk to tweet that ESG is a ""scam.""

But while Tesla has been a trailblazer in driving electric vehicle adoption, VettaFi's Dave Nadig told Yahoo Finance Live (video above), the company's environmental record may not be enough to bolster its holistic ESG score.

""It's important to remember that ESG has three letters in it, not just one,"" Nadig said. ""And I think his concern was, well, we're getting booted out, and we're supposed to be this environmentally go-forward company that's going to change our electric grid. I think that may all be true, but there's also an S and a G.""

Nadig explained that the ""social part has to do with how you're treating your employees, and the governance part often has to do with how well you're managing your company, what your regulatory environment is, what your lawsuit situation looks like. All of those things have been going the wrong way for Tesla for months."" Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk introduces the falcon wing door on the Model X electric sports-utility vehicles during a presentation in Fremont, California September 29, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam

Margaret Dorn, S&P's head of ESG indices for North America, stated that Tesla's rating was adversely affected by allegations of racial discrimination and poor working conditions in its Fremont, California, factory in addition to the company's handling of an investigation of deaths linked to its autopilot feature, business conduct, and lack of a low-carbon strategy contributed to the company's overall score.

Dorn also noted Tesla's ESG ranking has remained ""fairly stable"" in the last year while the relative strength of the EV maker's rating against global peers in the automotive sector has diminished.

Another important consideration is that the S&P 500 ESG Index doesn't issue its holdings merely on ESG rankings but constructs the index to mimic S&P 500 industry weights while also improving on sustainability and social issues.

To ""reflect the evolving sentiments of a sustainability-minded investor,"" Dorn noted, the index excludes companies with at least moderate exposure to or ownership of controversial weapons, thermal coal, tobacco products, oil sands, small arms, and military contracting.

Top holdings include tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOGL). Exxon Mobil (XOM) also made the list, despite having a high-risk rating due to carbon emissions. S&P did not comment on the ETF's other holdings.

Given the specific criteria of this index, Tesla getting ""kicked out of an ESG ETF makes a lot of sense,"" Nadig said. ""To get kicked out of purely a net-zero impact ETF focused only on the environment, maybe he'd have a point. But ESG funds are not one-size-fits-all. You've got to look under the hood.""

Founder and boss at ARK Investment Management, Cathie Wood has had a difficult start to the year. Last time the global markets faced upheaval during 2020, Wood came out as one of the best performing hedge fund managers and returned 170% in the year. This time around, the negative markers are less unique than a pandemic, with sky-high inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions turning investors away from risky, growth stocks. Her flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) has fallen by more than 53% since the start of the year, and her portfolio size has shrunk from $33.08 billion at the end of December 2021 to $23.95 billion at the end of Q1 2022.

Even while the market sends her stock picks tumbling down, Cathie Wood is doubling up on her bets, stating that these innovative companies are trading in 'deep value territory'. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is down 70% since the start of the year amid collapsing cryptocurrency prices, but Wood recently increased her stake in the crypto platform by 29%. This goes to show that Wood is not giving up on her vision for the future of tech, and this self-belief is continuing to attract investors to her fund. It has recorded inflows of approximately $1.3 billion so far in 2022, and also recently posted four consecutive weeks of positive inflows, including $455.7 million in the week ending May 4. 12 Best ARK Stocks To Buy Now

9. Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U)

ARK Investment Management’s 13 Portfolio: 3.41% ARK Investment Management’s Stake Value (As of the end of Q1): $817.90 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39

Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) is a video game software developer based in California. At the close of Q1 2022, Cathie Wood's stake in the company amounted to 3.41% of her total portfolio, and was worth roughly $818 million. In total, 39 hedge funds were long on Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) shares at the end of March, up from 36 hedge funds in the quarter before.

For the first quarter, Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) reported EPS figures in-line with estimates, coming in at -$0.08. Its revenue for the quarter was registered at $320.1 million, underperforming analysts' forecasts by $1.02 million, but showing a 36.4% jump from the year-ago quarter.

On May 11, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter reiterated an ‘Outperform’ rating on Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) shares, and slashed the price target to $70 from $125.

Investment firm ClearBridge Investments talked about Unity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) and its prospects in a Q1 2022 letter to investors. The fund said:

“We took advantage of a correction in higher-multiple stocks early in the first quarter to purchase shares of Unity Software (NYSE:U), a leading platform to create, run and monetize 3D content. With about 1.6 million monthly active creators versus roughly 15 million potential content creators in gaming alone, we believe the company’s Create Engine is still underpenetrated relative to its core addressable market. We similarly see a long runway for growth in Unity’s Operate Solutions segment given its advertising network commands single-digit share of the $60 billion mobile app install ad market today. Furthermore, we believe Unity is well-positioned to expand its addressable market to include industries beyond gaming, on both the operate and create sides of their business (Exhibit 1). The company is not yet free cash flow positive but given strong net expansion rates and high gross margins, we see a path to improving profitability over time, with management notably targeting positive free cash flow this fiscal year.

8. Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO)

ARK Investment Management’s 13 Portfolio: 3.45% ARK Investment Management’s Stake Value: $827.55 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75

Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) operates a cloud communications platform which enables customers to build customer engagement tools within software. Wood held 5.02 million shares of the firm priced at roughly $827.6 million, representing 3.45% of her total Q1 2022 portfolio.

A detailed review of the 900+ elite hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey found that 75 hedge funds were long Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) at the end of Q1 2022. The aggregate value of these positions was recorded at $3.25 billion. In comparison, 80 hedge funds held stakes in the company at the end of the fourth quarter.

On May 23, Jefferies analyst Samad Samana lowered the firm's price target on Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) to $130 from $175, and maintained a 'Buy' rating on the company shares. The analyst revised the price target for several software companies in his coverage on account of the current volatility in the macro backdrop.

For the first quarter, Twilio Inc.'s (NYSE:TWLO) EPS outperformed estimates by $0.21. The company's quarterly revenue increased 48.37% year-on-year, coming in at $875.4 million which was above forecasts by $11.6 million.

Investment firm RiverPark Funds discussed the performance and prospects of Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here's what the fund said:

“Twilio: TWLO shares were also down sharply to end the year. Just like after 1Q and 2Q, despite another quarterly beat in 3Q, management guidance–which we believe to be conservative– disappointed some investors. Third quarter revenue of $740 million was up 65% year over year, significantly exceeding management’s guidance of 50%-52% revenue growth. Management guided 4Q21 revenue to +40% revenue growth, which was ahead of sell side expectations, but likely below buy side expectations. Investors were also troubled by the departure of COO George Hu, who has been credited with rebuilding Twilio’s sales and marketing teams after arriving from SaleForce.com shortly after the company’s IPO in 2016.

The COVID crisis has accelerated the adoption of the company’s cloud-based, integrated communications platform that allows companies in a wide range of businesses to embed digital communications capabilities (video, chat, voice, SMS, fax, and email) into their customer facing applications without needing to build back-end infrastructure and interfaces. Twilio’s total addressable market is now greater than $40 billion, which should grow by 50% over the next few years, providing a strong secular tailwind for the company. We expect the company’s gross margin to continue to expand from 54% in the second quarter toward management’s long-term goal of 60%-65%, and, as the company grows to scale, we expect its non-GAAP operating margin to expand to 25%.”

7. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)

ARK Investment Management’s 13 Portfolio: 4.11% ARK Investment Management’s Stake Value: $986.39 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 43

Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) operates a video communications platform. It was Cathie Wood's star performer during the Covid pandemic, rising more than 405% in 2020. It lost steam as the world re-opened after the Covid lockdowns, but Cathie Wood still maintains a long-term bullish view on the company shares. She increased her stake in Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) by 23% during the first quarter, owning 8.41 million shares valued at $986 million.

Its revenue for the first quarter stood at $1.07 billion, above market estimates by roughly $526,000. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) posted earnings per share of $1.03 for Q1 2022, outperforming consensus estimates by $0.16.

On May 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall noted that sentiment on Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) was ""overwhelmingly negative"" after its Q1 report. The analyst feels the market is overlooking the company's attractive business model, and the fact that video demand continues to prove durable. She feels that the company ""rebutted concerns"" with its latest quarterly earnings, and gave the stock an 'Overweight' rating with a $140 price target.

43 hedge funds reported bullish bets on Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) at the close of Q1 2022, as compared to 48 hedge funds in the previous quarter. The total value of Q1 holdings stood at $3.16 billion.

Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management was the largest Q1 shareholder of the firm, with a $1 billion stake which consisted of 14.32 million shares.

Baird analyst Catherine Ramsay Schulte in late April gave EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) an 'Outperform' rating, and cut the price target to $90 from $100. The analyst feels the company's core business is well-positioned in the market, and advances in its multi-cancer program could potentially drive shares meaningfully higher over the next 12 months.

The company's EPS figures for the first quarter missed estimates by $0.14. EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) recorded a revenue of $486.6 million for the quarter, outperforming estimates by $26.7 million.

32 hedge funds held combined positions worth $1.53 billion in EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) at the end of March. This is down from 34 hedge funds a quarter ago.

Here is what RiverPark Funds, an investment firm, had to say about EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:

“Exact Sciences: EXAS shares declined on a disappointing recovery in Cologuard screening due to COVID. Despite continued revenue growth from Precision Oncology and COVID testing, and Cologuard screening revenue growth of 30%, COVID restrictions limited access to physicians’ offices for the company’s and its Pfizer Joint Venture sales force as well as causing a severe drop off of in-person wellness visits.

In the last year, Exact has also pivoted the company significantly from its single cancer screening tests (Cologuard for colon cancer and Oncotype for breast cancer) to multi-cancer screening through its Thrive acquisition, and to minimal residual disease and recurrence monitoring through its Ashion and Tardis acquisitions. Through this pivot, Exact has tripled its market opportunity from $20 billion to $60 billion.”

In addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Teladoc Health, Inc (NYSE:TDOC), and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) is a popular stock among hedge funds in 2022.

Elon Musk’s Ultimatum to Tesla Execs: Return to the Office or Get Out One-Third of Americans Making $250,000 Live Paycheck-to-Paycheck, Survey Finds Jamie Dimon Says JPMorgan Is Bracing Itself for Economic ‘Hurricane’ Fed Starts Experiment of Letting $8.9 Trillion Portfolio Shrink Ready to Buy a House? Just Wait a Few Weeks

The value of venture deals in the country tumbled 44% to $24.7 billion in the first four months of the year, compared with a year earlier, according to data from the research firm Preqin. That’s almost twice the rate of decline in the US and nearly four times the pace of the global slide.

A rout is sweeping the entire tech industry this year, which some have argued is well-earned and overdue. After more than a decade of surging valuations, the sector has taken a beating, with prominent stocks like Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. tumbling and venture investors pulling back from high-risk deals.

Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital warned founders and chief executives last week that the good times are over and they need to prepare for a new era with severely constrained access to capital. “Rates are rising, money is no longer free, and that has massive implications for valuations and fundraising,” it said in a presentation for its portfolio companies.

China’s situation has been aggravated by the Communist Party’s crackdown on tech giants and rigid policies for stamping out Covid-19. Lockdowns in cities like Shanghai have hampered all manner of business, from advertising and investments to the production of Tesla automobiles and Apple Inc. iPhones.

“Last year, because of domestic policy, the financing progress was slowed down, while this year many fundraising deals were completely suspended due to the impact of the plunge of the global capital market and the outbreak of the pandemic,” Duane Kuang Ziping, founding managing partner of Qiming Venture Partners, wrote in an article published this month.

Many startups that were seeking financing have been in a difficult situation for more than a year, wrote Kuang. Qiming has made roughly the same amount of investments from January to April this year as the same period a year ago, though many were follow-on deals with its existing projects.

China hit a record of more than $130 billion in venture deals in 2021 despite the government crackdown, according to Preqin. That was more than 50% higher than the year before.

Beijing went after companies that dominated certain spheres in online commerce and content like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and food delivery leader Meituan, and investors bet that smaller players could thrive or escape the worst of the regulatory crackdown. VCs continued to back select players they thought could thrive over the long run as the world’s No. 2 economy moved up the tech ladder.

Indeed, despite the decline in money this year, both deal values and volumes in China from January to April this year have surpassed those during the same period in 2020.

Yi Zheng, partner at Zoo Capital said he is “cautious but still optimistic” about China. There are still lots of opportunities in the country because of its large domestic market and countries around the world are seeking alternatives for localizing supply chains, he said.

“Investors and LPs may not be as desperate as the data showed,” Zheng said. “They are still investing in China but at a different pace and in different ways in the current economic cycle.”

More investments are going into sectors favored by the Communist government, including renewable energy and electric vehicles. Under President Xi Jinping, the Beijing authorities have made a priority of increasing the competitiveness of key industries, including semiconductors and artificial intelligence. The biggest deals so far this year included an $800 million Series B round for a supply chain technology unit of JD.com Inc. driven by Hillhouse Capital and Warburg Pincus, and a 5 billion yuan ($750 million) bet on chipmaker Guangdong Fenghua Advanced Technology Holding Co. from investors including UBS and China Merchants Capital, according to Preqin.

“We see a transition of popular sectors among the investors,” said Helen Lee, an associate of company intelligence at Preqin.

In contrast, China’s consumer tech industry was among those hardest hit by the regulatory shake-ups. The combined value of VC deals in information technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary industries dropped 55% in the first four months of 2022, after a jump of 190% in the previous year. Meanwhile, investment in industrials, energy and utilities as well as raw materials and natural resources are on the rise.

This trend echoes the Chinese government’s repeated call for self-reliance in core technologies. In the first four months of 2022, four out of the five biggest venture capital deals in China were in the new energy, semiconductors and electronic components, all sectors the Chinese government is supporting.

Investors’ attitudes are “mixed” towards China, according to an April report published by Preqin analysts. “Some have hit pause, while others believe that paying attention to China’s long-term strategies and investing in key growth sectors, such as robotics and new energy vehicles, can remain a winning strategy,” the analysts said.

982,"Tesla, VW Keep Shanghai Workers Isolated Even as Lockdown Eases","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. and Volkswagen AG plan to keep workers at their Shanghai factories isolated in so-called closed loop management systems until June 10, according to people familiar with the matter, even as authorities allow most residents to move freely around the city amid falling Covid-19 cases.

Elon Musk’s electric-car maker told the more than 10,000 workers living in Tesla’s “factory bubble” to be prepared to stay in the system until June 10, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the plans are private. While movement restrictions are being lifted for residents in low-risk parts of Shanghai, the company wants to have a 10-day buffer to ensure production stability, they said.

Tesla has gone to great lengths to resume production at the Shanghai plant, which was shut for about three weeks from late March because of the city’s Covid lockdown, costing it around 40,000 units of lost output. Workers brought in to bring the factory back up to speed have been housed in disused factories and an old military camp, with day-shift and night-shift workers sharing beds in makeshift dorms.

VW’s Shanghai factory, operated with local partner SAIC Motor Corp., also told employees that it would keep its closed-loop system in place until June 10, according to an internal notice seen by Bloomberg News. All workers living on site have been asked to stay, while others should remain at home, the memo said. The company will gradually step up to full production between June 13 to June 30, it said.

A representative for Tesla in China didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for VW said: “SAIC-VW is still under a closed-loop production system, and will further adjust production plans based on relevant policies,” without giving out a specific timeframe.

Story continues

With Covid-19 cases easing, Shanghai is relaxing some of the strictest virus controls of the pandemic and moving to stimulate the country’s faltering economy. Residents in low-risks areas will be free to move around the city from June 1, and companies will no longer need to be on a “whitelist” to resume production.

Tested Regularly

First used during the Beijing Winter Olympics as a way of keeping athletes and support staff separate from the wider population, closed loops, or factory bubbles, typically require workers to only go from on-site accommodation to the factory and back, and be tested regularly for Covid. The systems have been promoted by officials as a way to restart industry while limiting virus transmission. The toll on workers, however is significant, with staff constantly tested and separated from outside society.

China’s dogged adherence to stamping out the coronavirus at all costs has slowed everything from consumer spending to manufacturing in the world’s second-largest economy.

Not a single car was sold in Shanghai last month and overall passenger vehicle sales in China tumbled 36% from a year ago to 1.06 million units, the biggest decline since March 2020, China Passenger Car Association data released earlier this month showed.

The country cut the purchase tax on passenger cars by half as part of a raft of measures aimed at stimulating the economy.

992,The creator of Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency says he’s a ‘grifter’ that doesn’t understand coding ‘as well as he made out’,"Elon Musk may love Dogecoin, but the cocreator of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency isn’t fond of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO.

“He’s a grifter. He sells a vision in hopes that he can one day deliver what he’s promising, but he doesn’t know that. He’s just really good at pretending he knows. That’s very evident with the Tesla full-self-driving promise,” Jackson Palmer said of Musk in an interview with Australian news outlet Crikey that published Monday.

Palmer, who is Australian, said he and Musk have an “interesting past,” mentioning the first time he messaged Musk on Twitter years ago.

At the time, Palmer wrote a code script that would detect and automatically report cryptocurrency scams posted on Twitter, he said, adding that he gave the script to Musk and crypto influencers. He said “it became apparent very quickly that [Musk] didn’t understand coding as well as he made out. He asked, ‘How do I run this Python [programming language] script?’”

After that, “I wasn’t a fan of him. My opinion on him and all billionaires is that I don’t care much for them.”

In 2013, Palmer and Billy Markus created Dogecoin as a joke based on the “Doge” meme, which portrays a Shiba Inu dog. Markus and Palmer didn’t intend for Dogecoin to be taken seriously, but to their surprise, the community surrounding Dogecoin grew exponentially. Nonetheless, both left the Dogecoin project in 2015.

Musk has become an adamant supporter of Dogecoin, tweeting and hyping the cryptocurrency consistently over the years. In addition to investing in Dogecoin, Musk has mentioned working with its developers on bettering its network. The billionaire even impacts Dogecoin’s price movement when he tweets or speaks.

The Tesla CEO has a friendly relationship with Markus online, but he doesn’t have the same rapport with Palmer.

“About a year ago when Musk was saying something about crypto, I said Elon Musk was and always will be a grifter but the world loves grifters. They love the idea that they may also be a billionaire one day, and that’s the dream he’s selling,” Palmer said. “When he talks to other users on Twitter, they’re like, ‘Wow, Elon is talking to me! Maybe I can be a friend of his, or even become a billionaire myself.’”

Story continues

In response, Musk tweeted on Tuesday, saying, “You falsely claimed ur lame snippet of Python gets rid of bots. Ok buddy, then share it with the world.

“My kids wrote better code when they were 12 than the nonsense script Jackson sent me,” Musk added. “Like I said, if it’s so great, he should share it with the world and make everyone’s experience with Twitter better. If he does, you will see what I mean. Jackson Palmer is a tool.”

While Palmer is partly responsible for the creation of Dogecoin, he has denounced and criticized the crypto space.

“[I]t’s so easy to grift now through crypto,” he said.

Many speculate that we’re now in “crypto winter,” but Palmer disagrees. “I still see heaps of money being funneled in by crypto promoters. They’re waiting for a fresh batch of fools to come in. This happens in cycles. You wait for a while for the collective memory of the world to forget about how much of a scam it is,” he said.

“Sadly I wish it was the end of crypto, but it’s not. More holistically, in this system of griftonomics, hypercapitalism, rentier capitalism, increasingly people are doing nothing but making money off doing nothing, it’s kind of fucked us all up. It’s given people this weird mental issue that things that five to 10 years ago people would have the common sense to say ‘That’s weird,’ are okay. Now, even if it’s fraudulent, they think, ‘Do I really care?’”

Just Wait a Few Weeks Soros’s Money Manager Warns Recession ‘Inevitable’ But Market Timing Is Off Giant Deep Ocean Turbine Trial Offers Hope of Endless Green Power Chinese Banks Overflow With Cash That Nobody Wants to Borrow Biden Says US Will Provide Ukraine Advanced Rocket Systems

Retail buyers have remained steadfast even as the company’s troubles have mounted since April, sparking a dizzying drop in the electric-vehicle maker’s share price. And after last week’s 14% surge, that loyal following could supercharge a recovery with investors again starting to turn to growth stocks.

“In May, we’ve seen the strongest monthly buying of Tesla shares by retail investors since August 2020, when the company announced its first stock split,” Vanda Research analyst Fabian Birli said. Whatever the reason -- anticipation of another stock split, the army of Musk-fans doubling-down after the Twitter deal or just plain dip-buying -- there has been a “clear uptick in retail sentiment for Tesla since the start of the month,” Birli added.

Net buying of Tesla shares by retail investors in May was $708 million as of Friday, the second most among mega-cap technology stocks, trailing only Apple Inc. Tesla was the top gainer on the NYSE FANG+ Index last week and the third biggest contributor to the S&P 500 Index as it posted its biggest weekly gain since November 2020.

Tesla shares are down 34% since a recent peak on April 4 due to the company’s manufacturing troubles in China and investors’ fears about growth slowing worldwide. The noise from the CEO Elon Musk’s bid for Twitter Inc. also hasn’t helped. But the stock is still hardly cheap compared to Tesla’s peers, as the company’s $786 billion market capitalization is head and shoulders above any other global auto company.

Musk’s retail fans have a lot to do with that strength.

Story continues

“A good way to look at the situation is to compare the cult following that Elon Musk has versus the cult following that Bitcoin and other crytpos had until recently,” said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Musk has produced game changing products in several areas, so confidence level is much higher… and that’s why the stock has been able to bounce nicely now that the broad market has stabilized, while Bitcoin is still languishing,” the strategist said.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The company’s shares closed down 0.2% on Tuesday.

As retail traders’ ability to influence the stock market has increased in recent years, companies have recognized the value in attracting these investors with maneuvers like stock splits, which reduce the price of a share and makes them more appealing to individual investors.

Tech behemoths Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. also recently split their shares in an effort to bring in retail buyers. In fact, Tesla’s own stratospheric rise in its stock price in 2020 was in part fueled by a stock split, and the company on March 28 announced its plan for another via a tweet.

“The loyal retail following for Tesla holds an advantage for long-term shareholders in the company as these investors are willing to look through near-term negatives which softens the drops in the stock and can accelerate any upward trends,” said Gene Munster, former technology analyst who’s now a managing partner at venture-capital firm Loup Ventures.

Tesla is making the push after trying a project that pooled together 64 northern Texas homes outfitted with rooftop solar and Powerwall batteries. The pilot project showed that the setup can tap spare battery capacity and provide grid services within seconds, executives said Tuesday at a grid workshop hosted by Elon Musk’s company.

Tesla is advocating for rule changes with the main Texas grid operator to set terms on how owners of such residential batteries can participate in the power market and be compensated. Households received gift cards for their role in the pilot project. A residential program could be rolled out within a year if the Electric Reliability Council of Texas approves, Arushi Sharma Frank, Tesla’s US energy markets policy lead, said during Ercot’s virtual workshop.

998,DeLorean is back for the future with brand new EV,"The movie ""Back to the Future"" made then-defunct automaker DeLorean Motor Company and its ""gull-wing"" sports car a pop culture icon. Now the automaker is back and trying to renew that status with some electric buzz of its own.

The DeLorean Motor Company, which has been revived with new ownership in San Antonio, Texas, has debuted the next car to bear the DeLorean name: the all-electric Alpha5.

“We have been given the opportunity to re-imagine a brand that has meant so much to so many people from all corners of the globe, for four decades,” Neilo Harris, DeLorean Motor Company VP of Brand & Creative said in a statement. “DeLorean has touched so many lives and set the stage for so many memories… we are now witnessing a new chapter of this amazing story.” The DeLorean Alpha5

Back in the '80s, the original DeLorean Motor Company began developing a sedan that featured two gull-wing doors, but the company went bankrupt before it could be finished and before being featured in the first ""Back to the Future"" movie.

The new DeLorean is keeping the coupe silhouette intact while raising the utility level a tad with additional seating. The Alpha5 incorporates those famous gull-wing doors, which swing up to reveal two rows of seats in the DeLorean sedan. (If only we could see Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown’s wide-eyed expression at this engineering twist.) The DeLorean Alpha5

DeLorean is targeting some pretty impressive stats for its latest creation. The company says the Alpha5 can hit 60 mph in 2.99 seconds (and go from 0 to 88 mph in 4.35 seconds for those in the know) with a top speed of 155 mph. DeLorean says the car will also have a 300-mile range and a battery size of over 100kWh.

Pricing for the Alpha5 has not yet been disclosed, but one thing for certain is that it will be entering a crowded and competitive field. With a name like DeLorean, however, the Alpha5 might catch some “lightning” in a bottle, and for the company’s sake, propel the brand into the future of electric vehicles.

Story continues The DeLorean Alpha5

""The Alpha5 is a representation of the past 40 years of DeLorean,"" Troy Beetz, chief marketing officer of DeLorean Motor Company, said in a statement. ""There was this enormous responsibility to make sure we honored the history of the DeLorean brand, but an even greater responsibility in curating its future...I think we did both with the Alpha5.""

For those interested in seeing the car in person, DeLorean says the Alpha5 will premiere at the Pebble Beach Concours d ‘Elegance in August later this summer. The DeLorean Alpha5
