1,The 7 Best Stocks Under $20 to Buy Now,"Although 2022 hasn’t gotten off to the start bullish investors were hoping for, the red ink does open the door for the best stocks under $20 to buy now. As many prominent financial advisors have mentioned, the silver lining in any bearish cycle is the chance to acquire high-potential companies at a discount, something that may not be available if the equities sector was in a frenzy.

Indeed, the positive to focus on is that the market needed to flush out the toxicities that got baked into the system. With all due respect to some of the frenetic meme trades that dominated the trailing year-and-a-half period, banking on fiscally decrepit companies may not be the recipe for sustained success. However, going after the best stocks under $20 could potentially yield long-term rewards.

7 Stocks to Buy on the Dip

For the purposes of this list, I’m going to focus on more of the lesser-known entities. Whether facing temporary setbacks or not being large enough to generate significant attention, these best stocks under $20 are trading in the background — but that might not last for long. Therefore, here are seven companies to pay attention to:

Despite exhortations from myriad transportation experts that electric vehicles (EVs) are the future, the harsh realty is that the future may be a long ways away. It all comes down to basic economics. According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for an EV this year is about $62,876. Given that the median household income in the U.S. is about $70,000, few families will pay 90% of their earnings on a car.

True, there are EV makers that specialize in ultra-compact cars or electric-powered trikes, but Americans have never embraced such dimensionally challenged rides. This is why I like Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID). Say what you want about the struggles that EV makers face when attempting to knock Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) off its perch. At least with Lucid, it’s not making any pretense about selling to middle-income consumers.

Instead, Lucid is 100% focused — at least for now — on affluent drivers. Frankly, with average EV costs through the roof, it’s the only consumer demographic to focus on. Therefore, if you have the patience, LCID is one of the best stocks under $20 to buy now.

Among North America’s largest energy infrastructure companies, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) represents a vital cog in the broader U.S. national security profile. Kinder Morgan owns an interest in or operates approximately 83,000 miles of pipelines and 141 terminals. Further, per its website, the company’s pipelines transport natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, carbon dioxide and other critical resources.

In addition, Kinder Morgan’s terminals store and handle renewable fuels, petroleum products, chemicals, vegetable oils and other products. Unlike energy firms that are tethered exclusively to exploration projects that are subject to extreme volatility, KMI is tied to everyday energy needs, facilitating relative stability.

What is especially appealing about KMI is that the equity unit suffered some red ink because of recent pressures to the crude oil market. For instance, President Joe Biden’s administration authorized the release of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

7 Dividend Stocks to Buy on the Dip

However, this and other dynamics made KMI one of the best stocks under $20 to buy now. You may want to consider the opportunity before it potentially fades away should demand return.

Best Stocks Under $20: Battalion Oil (BATL) a bunch of oil barrels are stacked high

An independent energy exploration and development firm, Battalion Oil (NYSEAMERICAN:BATL) is downright risky. Health, safety and environmental hazards cloud exploration projects. Additionally, you have the basic risk factor that drilling efforts may end up being unsuccessful. Therefore, conservative investors may be better served with midstream players as opposed to upstream businesses like Battalion.

That said, every investor is different. If you have the personality for risk tolerance, then BATL could very well be one of the best stocks under $20 to buy now. While Battalion swung higher for much of this year due to Russia’s shocking invasion of Ukraine sending energy markets into a panicked frenzy, pressures have started to weigh on the hydrocarbon sector.

Along with the increased supply associated with the strategic petroleum reserve release mentioned earlier, soaring inflation appears to have modified consumer behavior; namely, Americans are driving less (not including under special circumstances, like Memorial Day weekend).

However, all you need for the energy market to bounce back is another catalyst — say the return to the office. Thus, speculators should keep close tabs on BATL stock.

NuScale Power (SMR) clean energy stocks: a nuclear power plant in Belgium

I’ve been talking about NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) for quite some time and for good reason. An innovative take on the nuclear energy argument, NuScale specializes in small modular reactors, which are nuclear-powered facilities that feature the benefit of a much smaller footprint than their traditional counterparts. Theoretically, then, you can deploy small modular reactors (SMRs) in areas previously inaccessible to large nuclear powerplants.

Among the many intriguing applications of SMRs is empowering reverse osmosis desalination processes. While the technology to convert ocean water into drinking water has always existed, the process is very energy intensive. Possibly, NuScale’s SMR technology can help fill the opportunity gap, thus solving multiple future crises with one solution.

7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy on the Dip

To be fair, there are many about nuclear energy and the risks of circumstances going awry. In addition, NuScale entered the public market via a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC). While SMR stock may not be for the faint of heart, it is certainly one of the best stocks under $20 for those willing to ride through some choppy weather.

Best Stocks Under $20: Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN) Patterson-UTI energy logo on a screen.

Providing land drilling and pressure pumping services along with rental equipment, Patterson-UTI Energy (NASDAQ:PTEN) is one of the background players in the energy sector. However, I don’t mean that in the pejorative sense. As hydrocarbons suddenly enjoyed a surge of relevance because of the geopolitical crisis in eastern Europe, more attention is now focused on domestic energy production.

True, Democrats historically have eschewed support for hydrocarbons in favor of green energy infrastructure development. Here’s the reality: green energy will take a while to catch on. In the meantime, there are Americans paying multi-decade highs in gasoline prices. Plus, they’re hurt and angry right before a critical midterm election cycle.

As if to further confirm that PTEN is one of the best stocks under $20 to buy now, Patterson-UTI recently delivered a strong earnings performance for its second quarter, beating consensus targets on the top and bottom lines. Moving forward, economic realities will likely force greater investments in energy development projects, boding cynically well for PTEN stock.

Symbotic (SYM) 3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Should Consider

Among the signature pain points of the coronavirus pandemic and its broader impact on global commerce is the supply chain disruption. Suddenly, everyday people became aware of not only headline problems, but the minutia of disruptive events, such as container shortages and the clashing of economic incentivization; as in, being paid by miles driven versus compensated by the hour.

While I’m not presenting Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) as a panacea to our woes, it may lend a much-needed helping hand. Specializing in cutting-edge robotics and automation technology, Symbotic seeks to improve supply chain efficiencies. As an end-to-end solutions provider, the company has the potential to help enterprise-level clients identify their frictions and address them immediately, thus enhancing the bottom line.

7 Seriously Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy Now

To be clear, Symbotic also entered the public arena via a reverse merger with a SPAC. Given that SPAC-based business combinations have underperformed the benchmark equities index, SYM stock may not be appropriate for everyone. However, if you have some funds lying around for speculation, SYM stock could be one of the best stocks under $20 to buy now.

Best Stocks Under $20: Pennant Group (PNTG) A nurse is helping a older woman. Elder care. Senior care.

Getting old is simply a reality of life that eventually everyone must accept in gracious silence or kicking and screaming. In many cases, professional care may be required, which brings us to Pennant Group (NASDAQ:PNTG). Offering home health and hospice care, PNTG makes for a strong case as one of the best stocks under $20 to buy now based on demographic trends.

As the Pew Research Center stated, the baby boomer generation has always had an outsized presence compared to other age cohorts. Their numbers peaked at 78.8 million in 1999, though millennials finally replaced them as the largest living adult generation in the U.S. in 2019.

However, the reality is that as boomers retire and enter their golden years, they need to live somewhere. In addition, advances in healthcare and medicine means that people are generally living longer (setting aside the deaths of despair crisis). Therefore, PNTG stock is likely to be relevant for a very long time.

2,Tesla Stock: Wildly Expensive After Q2 Earnings Surge,"Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are starting to really heat up again, up more than 30% in July. Fueling the bounce was Tesla's impressive second-quarter beat and the relief rally experienced by the broader tech sector. Though the 57% earnings pop was impressive, the valuation remains incredibly stretched. Further, investors may underestimate the potential for a steep slide as the world economy tilts into a recession.

Not to take away from the incredible efforts of Elon Musk and company, but 12.1 times sales is just too high a price for an automaker that faces a wave of hungry rivals over the coming decade.

Recent comments from the Federal Reserve following another 75 bps rate hike were soothing to investors owning high-multiple growth stocks. While the meeting could spark a relief rally in the most beaten-down names, Tesla's long-term roadmap could prove very bumpy.

Few firms, especially automakers, are immune from the effects of an economic contraction.

Tesla Stock Clocks in Another Impressive Result

Tesla is making beating on earnings a habit. The latest beat was powered by higher average selling prices and strong vehicle deliveries. Demand for Tesla's hot line of EVs doesn't seem to signal that a recession is on the horizon. Whether Tesla's quarterly strength bodes well for the affluent consumer (who's less rattled by inflation) remains to be seen.

In any case, Tesla looks to have the momentum of a freight train as we head into a period of economic sluggishness. Whether Tesla's sales momentum can carry it through this recession is the million-dollar question.

Tesla remains the king of EVs, putting it on the right side of a powerful secular electrification trend that could span many years to come. After such quarterly strength, it certainly seems that secular tailwinds are stronger than economic headwinds.

A strong brand, an impressive lineup of vehicles, and top-of-the-line technologies have been differentiating factors that could act as some sort of moat around the firm's share of economic profits in the red-hot EV market.

Story continues

Revenues and margins seem to be on the uptrend. As Tesla's Superchargers continue rolling out across the nation (and then the world), an increasing number of consumers will be willing to go electric with their next vehicle purchase.

Tesla Stock: Worth the Premium Price Tag?

Despite the powerful secular trends, I do not view Tesla's moat as impenetrable. Tesla may be the EV leader today, but it's uncertain whether Elon Musk's empire can retain the throne 10 years from now. As traditional automakers go electric and become more tech-like, Tesla stock may face a considerable valuation multiple contraction.

Alternatively, the electrifying automakers — think Ford (F) — might be rewarded with a substantial multiple expansion. I'd argue that the former case is more probable. The argument for Tesla's premium multiple has been that the firm is a tech company that makes autos rather than an auto company with cool tech.

Sure, Tesla has intriguing technologies running behind the hood, but are such features and functionality replicable by other automakers who are beckoning in top tech talent? Probably. The playing field is bound to even through the decade, and I'd argue that Tesla may not be able to widen the lead over its competitors.

Tech titan Apple (AAPL) has been rumored to be getting into the auto business for quite some time now. Currently, the rumor mill is pointing to an all-electric and autonomous vehicle that may launch in the latter part of this decade.

As one of the most innovative technology companies on the planet, a move into the auto industry could weigh heavily on Tesla's economic moat. Apple has the brand and tech to outdo almost any rival it chooses to fight over market share.

All it took was one simple change in its iOS operating system to wreak havoc on social media companies. Apple's ad business is relatively small today, but the move may lay the foundation for a bigger push in the future, perhaps once the metaverse goes mainstream.

Apple's entry into auto represents a top threat for Tesla, and I don't think the threat is factored in at current valuations. Sure, Apple's many years away from launching a car, but when it does, Tesla's best days may fall into the rear-view mirror.

Wall Street's Take on Tesla

Turning to Wall Street, Tesla has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys, 6 Holds, and 7 Sells assigned in the past three months. The average Tesla price target of $872.28 implies a modest 3.5% upside potential. Analyst price targets range from a low of $73.00 per share to a high of $1,580 per share. (See TSLA stock forecast on TipRanks)

Takeaway: The Valuation Is Too High Relative to the Risks

Tesla is doing almost everything right these days. As we move into a recession, it may be tougher to continue blowing away the results. Further, competitive threats are poised to increase meaningfully over the next six years. Auto rivals and tech companies could find themselves breathing down Tesla's neck. That doesn't bode well for the rich multiple.

3,"Musk May Keep Selling Tesla, With or Without Twitter: MLIV Pulse","(Bloomberg) -- Investors expect Elon Musk to sell more shares of his electric carmaker Tesla Inc. by the end of 2022, according to the latest MLIV Pulse survey.

Now They Profit Big Shale Profits Finally Blossoming After Decade of Steep Losses

About 75% of 1,562 respondents, who include portfolio managers and retail traders, say Musk won’t end up owning Twitter Inc. -- a deal that led him to offload about $8.5 billion of Tesla shares in April. A third of respondents predict he will settle with the social-media company for more than $1 billion rather than seeing through his $44 billion takeover at $54.20 per share, while 27% think a judge will order him to pay the $1 billion breakup fee.

Musk will likely sell shares regardless of what happens with the Twitter deal,” said Mike Loukas, chief executive officer of TrueMark Investments, echoing the sentiment of 68% of those surveyed. “But if investors read too much into it, they’re likely not seeing the forest through the trees.”

That could signal further pain for Tesla stock, which is down about 16% this year, more than the 13.3% decline in the S&P 500. The Austin-based company has been roiled by supply-chain shortages, Covid-related lockdowns in China, and confusion surrounding Musk’s pursuit of Twitter.

Musk, 51, is the world’s richest person, with a $260 billion fortune derived largely from his stake in Tesla. But he’s been shedding shares as of late: He conducted a Twitter poll in November about selling 10% of his position, then proceeded to sell more than 15 million shares over the next couple of months.

Musk offloaded about 9.4 million Tesla shares in April after his deal to buy Twitter, amounting to $25 billion worth of stock sold in the span of six months. He’s now attempting to back out of the agreement, which will be the subject of a fast-tracked October trial in Delaware Chancery Court.

Story continues

Resolution Relief

Whatever the outcome, investors expect that Tesla shareholders will welcome an end to the matter.

“If his stock sale is accompanied by a definitive agreement that puts the Twitter mess behind him, Tesla could rally,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “A definitive end to Twitter would remove a distraction and theoretically allow Musk to focus more on Tesla.”

Still, survey respondents are less confident in Tesla’s upside relative to four other megacaps in the S&P 500. About a quarter said Microsoft Corp. offered the most potential, roughly the same share as Amazon.com Inc. Alphabet Inc. got 21% of the vote while Apple Inc. received 18%. Tesla came in last, with 12.5%.

The threat of competition for electric vehicles looms large, with most global automakers working on their own EVs. The macro backdrop is also challenging, with the US economy shrinking for two straight quarters.

Those wider concerns were on the minds of the investors who responded to the survey, resulting in a cautious note. They expect value stocks to perform better than growth shares over the next six months, though the largest technology companies are more likely than not to post at least modest gains from here through year-end.

“Any tech monopoly is going to be a flight for safety,” Alex Moazed, the chief executive officer of Applico, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “Investors want to put their money in the less risky places that can still grow.”

As for Musk, his time atop the Bloomberg Billionaires Index may be short-lived. After taking the No. 1 spot last year after Tesla’s huge rally, just over 50% of respondents say he will lose that position by the end of 2023. By comparison, almost 33% say he’ll hold on until 2025 or later.

Grace Capital’s Cate Faddis and Loup Ventures’ Gene Munster will take your questions in our live blog, MLIV Pulse Q&A: Musk, Tesla and Twitter. Tune in on Aug. 2 at 10 a.m. New York time, and send advance questions to TOPLive@bloomberg.net.

Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co. and CNGR Advanced Material Co. signed pricing agreements with the electric-vehicle giant for supplies until the middle of this decade, according to separate stock-exchange statements from the companies. The deals are for ternary precursor materials -- chemical cocktails that are key to storing energy in lithium-ion batteries.

The announcements come as major automakers look to scoop up battery metals in the face of a looming shortage. General Motors Co. unveiled deals to buy inputs ranging from lithium to cathode materials last week, shortly after Ford Motor Co. revealed a list of suppliers with raw materials including Argentinean lithium and Indonesian nickel.

Huayou Cobalt will supply the materials to Tesla from July 1, 2022 to the end of 2025. The miner said the prices of the products will be subject to market prices for nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as refining fees. CNGR will supply the EV automaker between 2023 and 2025.

The transition to cleaner energy is boosting demand for battery ingredients, while supply has been hampered by Covid-related logistical woes and a lack of investment. That’s pushing up the prices of the raw materials and is denting profitability for some carmakers.

Both Huayou and CNGR were among a list of direct suppliers named by Tesla in its 2021 annual impact report. CNGR said in its statement that it supplied Tesla from 2020 until this year.

11,China's CATL reshuffles management as billionaire executive exits,"SHANGHAI, Aug 1 (Reuters) - China's CATL said on Monday its vice chairman and deputy general manager Huang Shilin had resigned and would leave the battery maker to explore business opportunities elsewhere.

The departure of Huang, a billionaire who holds a near 11% stake in CATL, comes amid a broader reshuffle that will also see Chairman Zeng Yuqun take over the general manager role from Zhou Jia, who has been appointed as vice chairman, according to company filings with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange late on Monday.

Huang will explore business opportunities in sectors including solar panels, energy storage and battery charging, CATL said in a separate statement to Reuters.

He will continue promoting the development of new energy industry with potential synergies with CATL in the future, it added.

Huang is currently ranked 79th in Forbes Fortune List with a net worth of more than $20 billion. His stakeholding is second only to Zeng, whose net worth stood at $45.6 billion as of Aug. 1, according to Forbes' calculations.

CATL, whose clients include Tesla Inc and Volkswagen AG, is the world's largest battery maker.

China’s Rebound Remains Fragile as Factories, Property Slump Are We Ready to Start Saying the R-Word? Elon Musk’s Antics Turn Owners and Would-Be Buyers Against Tesla From Profits to Pay, JPMorgan’s Gold Secrets Spill Out in Court

Shares of both Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. have struggled throughout 2022, extending long-standing slumps as they fail to live up to the hopes of optimistic Wall Street analysts. The pair are confronting high inflation and a potential economic downturn that could damp demand. At the same time, aggressive interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve have made unprofitable growth stocks like these very much out of favor.

“We’re seeing a real reckoning across the class of companies that might have good growth prospects, but which aren’t making money,” said David Klink, senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank. “There’s a higher hurdle for owning growth stocks if the growth isn’t profitable, and just because Uber’s valuation looks low, it can still move lower.”

Uber shares fell 0.4% on Monday, while Lyft dropped 2.2%.

Uber reports second-quarter results before the market open on Tuesday. Lyft’s will follow after the market closes Thursday. While Uber’s stock rose 15% in July, that was its first positive month of 2022; it remains down 45% for the year. Lyft has lost nearly 70% of its value this year, while the Russell 1000 Index is down 14% and a gauge of airline stocks, another industry that’s a reopening beneficiary, has fallen 19%.

The comparatively better performance at Uber, investors say, come as it operates internationally, while Lyft is only in the US and Canada. In addition, Uber’s larger scale and auxiliary businesses like Uber Eats provide additional levers for growth. Analysts expect Uber to report a revenue increase of almost 90% in the quarter, compared with less than 30% at Lyft.

“Uber might have somewhat better prospects than Lyft, but only a few companies can really maneuver in this environment, and Uber and Lyft aren’t among them,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management, who said he wouldn’t invest in either.

A driver survey by MKM Partners in July found that increased fuel prices probably were leading drivers to cut down on the number of hours on they were on the road, suggesting potential supply constraints for Uber and Lyft heading into the third quarter.

“GDP is slowing, consumers are tightening their belts, and there’s high gas prices and upward pressure on wages,” Mahoney said. “It’s possible their profitability picture worsens further, and in this environment, investors are really looking at cash flow and wanting quality.”

Unprofitable growth stocks more broadly face challenges such as a rising cost of capital and tightening financial conditions that will limit their potential valuation upside, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategist Ryan Hammond wrote in a report last week.

Despite the headwinds, Wall Street remains positive on Uber. Almost 90% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while only one has a sell rating. The average analyst price target is $46.75, roughly double where the stock is now.

For Lyft, about 60% of analysts recommend buying, while the rest have the equivalent of a hold rating; none advocate selling, and the average analyst price target of $35.67 suggests a return potential of more than 160%.

JPMorgan is among the firms with a positive stance. It has an overweight rating on both Uber and Lyft, and named Uber one of its top picks, behind Amazon.com and Booking Holdings Inc.

Both are emerging as more structurally profitable, and they’re trading at a “March 2020 cash crunch/early pandemic price,” wrote analyst Doug Anmuth. However, he added, the pair remain “show-me stories, especially in challenging macro or a recession.”

Tech Chart of the Day

Technology stocks rallied on the last trading day of July in what became the Nasdaq 100 Index’s biggest monthly gain in more than two years. Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. added about $196 billion in market value on Friday following their quarterly reports. The e-commerce giant notched up its biggest monthly gain since October 2009, while for the iPhone maker it was the largest since August 2020.

Top Tech Stories

Tesla Inc. has signed new long-term deals with two of its existing Chinese battery-materials suppliers, the latest move by automakers to secure supplies amid intensifying competition.

Investors expect Elon Musk to sell more shares of Tesla by the end of 2022, according to the latest MLIV Pulse survey. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. fell on Monday amid escalating concerns that the stock could be booted off US exchanges for failing to comply with disclosure rules. Sony Group Corp. fell as much as 7% after the tech giant trimmed its profit outlook, reflecting the impact of recession fears on the global gaming industry. Japan’s push to turbocharge its startup ecosystem as part of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s New Capitalism agenda will need at least a decade to bear fruit, according to Yo Shibata, a Japanese entrepreneur and angel investor. Indonesia began blocking websites from gaming store Steam to digital wallet PayPal Holdings Inc. over the weekend, making good on promises to bar internet services that don’t register locally and submit to a tightening regulatory regime. Jidu Auto, an autonomous electric vehicle startup backed by Chinese tech giant Baidu Inc., is considering raising about $300 million to $400 million in fresh funds, according to people familiar with the situation.

By Aniruddha Ghosh and Devik Jain

Aug 1 (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 fell in volatile trading on Monday as a strong earnings-driven rally from last week lost steam, with losses in economy-sensitive sectors being countered by gains in shares of Boeing and Tesla.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted their biggest monthly percentage gains since 2020 in July on stronger-than-expected second-quarter results and on hopes the Federal Reserve need not to be as aggressive with interest rate hikes as some had feared.

""The market was a little bit on edge, it's just trying to find its way right now. A lot of people are trying to understand have we seen the bottom and are we going to move higher from here,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management.

Offering support to the Dow and S&P 500, Boeing Co gained 5.4% after a Reuters report the U.S. aviation regulator approved the planemaker's inspection and modification plan to resume deliveries of 787 Dreamliners.

Meanwhile, data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed-less-than-expected in July and there were signs that supply constraints are easing..

The report came on the heels of surveys which showed factories across Asia and Europe struggled for momentum in July as flagging global demand and China's strict COVID-19 curbs slowed production.

That dragged oil prices lower on demand concerns, which in turn weighed on the S&P 500 energy sector. The index fell 2.8% and was the top loser among the 11 sectors.

The factory activity data will be followed by the monthly U.S. jobs report on Friday, which will be parsed for cues for the Fed's next moves.

The U.S. central bank has raised interest rates by 2.25 percentage points so far this year and has vowed to be data-driven in its approach toward future hikes.

Worries about a recession have weighed on stock markets this year, with the benchmark index down 13.4% as investors adjust their expectations on economic growth and corporate profits in the face of tightening financial conditions.

However, the earnings season has showed companies were far more resilient in the second quarter than estimated.

Of the 283 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, 78.1% have topped profit estimates, as per Refinitiv data. The long-term average is 66.1%.

Activision Blizzard, Devon Energy and Simon Property Group are scheduled to report quarterly results later in the day.

At 10:40 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 39.30 points, or 0.12%, at 32,805.83, the S&P 500 was down 5.72 points, or 0.14%, at 4,124.57.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 34.19 points, or 0.28%, at 12,424.88, boosted by 2.7% rise in shares of Tesla Inc

PerkinElmer Inc jumped 9% after the medical diagnostic firm said it will sell some of its businesses along with the brand name to private equity firm New Mountain Capital for up to $2.45 billion in cash.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.50-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 31 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 31 new highs and 70 new lows. (Reporting by Aniruddha Ghosh, Devik Jain and Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru)",2022-08-01T14:58:55+00:00,2022-08-01

The shares jumped as much as 5% to $935.64 on Monday, marking a gain of 49% from the May 24 close of $628.16. They’ve since pared some of of that gain but remain up by about 2%. Tesla is coming off a 32% gain in July, its best month since October 2021.

The Elon Musk-led carmaker will hold its annual general meeting on Aug. 4, where its investors will get to vote on a 3-for-1 stock split plan. If approved, it will be Tesla’s second share-split in less than two years. The company had executed a five-for-one stock split in 2020, a move that led to a 60% surge in the share price from the day of the announcement to the execution date.

The exuberance for Tesla comes amid a broader wave of optimism in the US stock market. The S&P 500 Index rose 9.1% in July for its best month since November 2020, while the Nasdaq 100 Index surged 13% for its best monthly performance since April 2020.

But Tesla’s rally has been even more impressive, helping to wipe out it underperformance against the S&P 500 this year. Both the stock and the broad equities benchmark are down about 13% for 2022.

20,F vs. TSLA: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now?,"Investors with an interest in Automotive - Domestic stocks have likely encountered both Ford Motor Company (F) and Tesla (TSLA). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.

Right now, both Ford Motor Company and Tesla are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.

Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.

F currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.56, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 74.97. We also note that F has a PEG ratio of 0.83. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 2.40.

Another notable valuation metric for F is its P/B ratio of 1.33. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 25.

These are just a few of the metrics contributing to F's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of D.

Both F and TSLA are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that F is the superior value option right now.

Huang, 56, resigned for personal reasons and the move won’t have any negative impact on business operations, Ningde, Fujian-based CATL said in an earlier statement. He will be succeeded by the company’s president, 44-year-old Zhou Jia.

Huang, China’s ninth richest person with a net worth of about $20 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has a stake of about 10.6% in CATL.

In June, CATL denied rumors that Huang cut his stake for cash, saying that he had transferred about 2 million shares to six private funds he owned and there was no change in the size of his holding.

CATL Denies Rumor That Vice Chairman Cut Stake for Cash

CATL, which listed in Shenzhen in 2018, has a dominant position in the world’s EV battery market, supplying companies including Tesla Inc. and Chinese startups Nio Inc. and Xpeng Inc. CATL shares are down 9% this year, but up more than 2,000% since listing.

Kevin Shang, an analyst Wood Mackenzie, said he wasn’t surprised that Huang was leaving to explore opportunities in solar, fast charging and the booming energy storage sector. He said Huang obviously has a passion for those areas, based on his public comments, and that other big names could also leave leading battery companies to set up businesses focused on energy storage.

By Aniruddha Ghosh and Devik Jain

Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes struggled to rise on Monday as an earnings-driven rally from last week faded and economic-sensitive sectors as well as Microsoft fell although gains in Boeing and Tesla limited the losses.

Planemaker Boeing Co gained 6.5% after a Reuters report the U.S. aviation regulator approved its inspection and modification plan to resume deliveries of 787 Dreamliners.

Amid increasing uncertainty in markets, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted in July their biggest monthly percentage gains since 2020 on solid quarterly results and on hopes the Federal Reserve would be less aggressive with interest rate hikes.

The U.S. central bank has raised rates by 2.25 percentage points this year and has vowed to be data-driven in its approach toward future hikes.

""We have two negative GDP reports, a Fed that says the policy rates are now near neutral and yet a number of people think that the Fed has a lot further to go,"" said Chuck Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management.

""It's not like we don't know that growth has slowed a lot and it could be that the economy is bottoming, the circumstance right now is pretty uncertain.""

Data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed-less-than-expected in July and there were signs that supply constraints are easing..

The report came on the heels of surveys that showed factories across Asia and Europe struggled in July as flagging global demand and China's strict COVID-19 curbs slowed production.

We're also watching Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's countersuit against Twitter (TWTR), which he filed Friday as part of his ongoing efforts to walk away from his $44 billion agreement to acquire the social media site.

And after more than a year of delays, Boeing (BA) reportedly has the Federal Aviation Administration's clearance on its plan to repair and resume deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner. Here's more on the three legal stories we're watching this week:

Trial begins over publishing dominance

Penguin Random House, the world's largest book publisher, is scheduled to begin a trial in Washington, DC, on Monday to defend the Justice Department’s federal antitrust lawsuit seeking to stop its $2.2 billion deal to acquire rival Simon & Schuster.

The deal, reached in 2020, would reduce the number of U.S. publishers from five to four.

The Justice Department contends the deal would allow Penguin Random House to control close to half the market for publishing rights acquisitions — leaving consumers with fewer choices. The department also argues that the deal would drive down compensation paid to authors for their work.

Twitter v. Musk adds Musk v. Twitter

Musk struck back against Twitter (TWTR) on Friday in a countersuit as part of his ongoing efforts to avoid going through with his deal to buy the company for $44 billion. The Tesla (TSLA) CEO filed the counterclaim confidentially, hiding it from public view. A counterclaim could frustrate the case’s timeline already set for trial in October, given that time is generally set for the parties to exchange and review documents.

Last week the Delaware Chancery Court’s chief judge granted Twitter an expedited trial to take place over five days in October. The judge also granted Musk’s request for an Oct. 17 start date. Twitter is seeking the fast-paced trial to avoid what it says are irreparable harms of ongoing business disruptions and stock market volatility.

Story continues

Twitter argues in its lawsuit that Musk should be required to go through with the deal because his reasons for terminating it fall outside the contract and are mere cover for buyer’s remorse. Musk, on the other hand, argues that he’s entitled to walk away from the deal because Twitter is supposedly refusing to give him data he wants on the number of fake accounts that operate on its platform.

Boeing 787 Dreamliner gets green light

A regulatory hold-up that has frustrated Boeing’s (BA) commercial aircraft business was lifted in large part Friday when the Federal Aviation Authority approved its plans to repair and resume deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, according to multiple reports. The change will permit the company to start realizing approximately $10 billion in cash that was idled by the stop-down on deliveries, Bloomberg reported.

The FAA halted Boeing Dreamliner deliveries in May 2021 over safety concerns related to the plane's fuselage construction, after Boeing voluntarily stopped delivering the aircraft in late 2020. On Friday, the agency reportedly granted preliminary clearance so that Boeing could begin making the proposed repairs, and resume deliveries as soon as August.

The FAA's requirements for repairs to the Dreamliner compounded Boeing's existing struggles to return its 737 Max aircraft to the skies. Regulators around the globe grounded the aircraft after two separate crashes of its model 8 series killed all 346 passengers and crew on board.

This Is How China Could Hit Back Over Pelosi’s Taiwan Visit You Won’t Like What Comes After Inflation Pelosi Is Expected to Visit Taiwan, Ramping Up US-China Tensions Pelosi Poised to Land in Taiwan as China Rips ‘Provocative’ Trip

This week, everyone working on energy and climate issues in the US is intensely focused on the Inflation Reduction Act, looking for smoke signals as to whether it will pass and if any modifications will be made.

The bill is a potential boon to many sectors of the green economy, including electric vehicles. Here are my team’s takeaways on some of the important EV-related aspects of the bill:

Tax Credit Extension

The revival of the $7,500 tax credit is a big deal, especially for Tesla, General Motors and Toyota. All three have sold at least 200,000 vehicles that were eligible for the incentive as the system is set up now. Once manufacturers cross that threshold, buyers of their cars start to receive reduced credits, and eventually none at all. Ford and Nissan are nearing this point, as well.

The bill would make the full incentive available again starting next year, and importantly, would allow consumers to access the perk at the point of sale instead of during tax season.

Automakers that have had sold fewer EVs might, in theory, be upset to see the 200,000-vehicle cap lifted, since it was bound to give them an advantage in the near term. But in practice, most should be happy to see the additional purchase support, since fuel economy regulations are set to tighten in the years ahead. This change will make it much easier to sell EVs and hit their targets.

While tax credits are important, it’s worth noting that Tesla buyers haven’t been eligible for federal tax credits for well over two years, and that hasn’t stopped the company from dominating the EV segment by accounting for more than 70% of battery-electric models sold in the US last year. Making products that consumers actually want is still more important than making products that qualify for tax credits.

As my Bloomberg News colleagues have pointed out, the requirement that battery materials are sourced locally could be challenging for carmakers to navigate. There’s also a requirement that a share of other components are manufactured in North America.

In auto board rooms across the country this week, there are likely requests flowing down the organization and out to suppliers to determine which models will qualify and how quickly sourcing can be localized. BNEF’s analysis indicates mid-stream refining capacity for battery metals is more likely to be an issue than raw material supply.

A Boost for Commercial EVs

New commercial EV provisions allow vehicles weighing less than 14,000 pounds to claim the $7,500 clean car tax credit. Heavier vehicles can have the lesser of two amounts: 30% of the differential between the clean vehicle and a comparable internal combustion engine vehicle, or a $40,000 incentive.

This would fully cover the cost of a 150 to 250 kilowatt-hour battery pack today, and will do more in the future as prices come down. It would be an immediate and significant boost to the nascent commercial EV market in the US, which lags Europe and China in most segments.

The bill also includes $3 billion to help the US Postal Service decarbonize its fleet and shift to EVs. The Postal Service recently announced it was increasing the portion of its initial 50,000 mail-truck purchase from Wisconsin-based Oshkosh that will be electric to 50%, a major win for activists who fought against the initial decision to go almost exclusively with combustion vehicles.

Loan Programs

The package also includes $2 billion to help automakers retool and convert existing facilities to manufacture clean vehicles, and allows for as much as $20 billion in loans to help auto companies build new clean-vehicle facilities across the country. Ford, GM and Stellantis are likely to benefit from the conversion portion going into a contract-bargaining year with the United Auto Workers union. EV manufacturing in the US is already ramping up quickly, and this provision — which has largely flown under the radar — will further accelerate progress.

Importantly, many plants being built or retooled for EVs are in Republican states. For example, VW invested $800 million in its plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and just announced last week it has started producing the first ID.4 electric sport utility vehicles there. Having a strong EV manufacturing base in red states should help prevent EVs from being a political football as the next federal election cycle rolls around.

Outlook

A sense of scale is important here. The bill would extend EV tax credit availability out to 2032. Over that period, BNEF expects around 175 million light-duty vehicles will be sold in the US. As it stands now, a sizable and growing portion of those will be eligible for a tax credit.

There’s lots more to process — BNEF clients can access our full initial take here — but my initial feeling is that the bill, coupled with the stricter fuel-economy regulations the Biden administration is putting in place, should put the US right back in the race for EV leadership. China is off to a very strong head start, but these are still early days. Don’t count the US out.

This week, everyone working on energy and climate issues in the US is intensely focused on the Inflation Reduction Act, looking for smoke signals as to whether it will pass and if any modifications will be made.

The bill is a potential boon to many sectors of the green economy, including electric vehicles. Here are my team’s takeaways on some of the important EV-related aspects of the bill:

Tax Credit Extension

The revival of the $7,500 tax credit is a big deal, especially for Tesla, General Motors and Toyota. All three have sold at least 200,000 vehicles that were eligible for the incentive as the system is set up now. Once manufacturers cross that threshold, buyers of their cars start to receive reduced credits, and eventually none at all. Ford and Nissan are nearing this point, as well.

The bill would make the full incentive available again starting next year, and importantly, would allow consumers to access the perk at the point of sale instead of during tax season.

Automakers that have had sold fewer EVs might, in theory, be upset to see the 200,000-vehicle cap lifted, since it was bound to give them an advantage in the near term. But in practice, most should be happy to see the additional purchase support, since fuel economy regulations are set to tighten in the years ahead. This change will make it much easier to sell EVs and hit their targets.

While tax credits are important, it’s worth noting that Tesla buyers haven’t been eligible for federal tax credits for well over two years, and that hasn’t stopped the company from dominating the EV segment by accounting for more than 70% of battery-electric models sold in the US last year. Making products that consumers actually want is still more important than making products that qualify for tax credits.

36,5 S&amp;P 500 Behemoths to Buy for Stellar Returns in August,"Wall Street has entered August after an impressive bull run in July. The July rally snapped six months of rigorous market meltdown. The investor community is divided about whether the market has bottomed out or it witnessed a bear market relief rally. Therefore, the market’s movement in August will be an important indicator.

The broad-market S&P 500 Index advanced 9.1% in last month. Despite the fact that the benchmark is still in correction territory, having declined 13.6% year to date, it may gather pace in the second half of 2022.

At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in the U.S. corporate behemoths from the S&P 500 stable. We have selected five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These are - Tesla Inc. TSLA, NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, Visa Inc. V, Chevron Corp. CVX and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM.

Wall Street May Gain Some Pace in 2H 2022

A high dose of interest rate therapy and extremely tight monetary control by the Fed to combat the  record-high inflation might show positive signals. The U.S. economy fell by 0.9% in second-quarter 2022 after declining 1.6% in the first quarter. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that both consumer and business spending dropped owing to mounting pieces for goods and services.

Recently released major economic data such as ISM manufacturing and services indexes, retail sales and industrial production dropped significantly. The housing market — one of the booming sectors during the pandemic — has been declining precipitously since April.

On Jul 27, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank may reduce the magnitude of rate hikes going forward depending on economic data. However, both Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that despite two consecutive quarters of U.S. GDP contraction, the economy is not in recession as major macro-economic variables do not indicate so.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants (market capital >$100 billion) as these companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.

Story continues

These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month. Zacks Investment Research

Tesla has acquired a substantial market share within the electric car segment. Increasing Model 3 delivery, which forms a significant chunk of TSLA’s overall deliveries, is aiding its top line. Along with Model 3, Model Y is contributing to its revenues. The global auto industry is gradually moving toward electric vehicles. Tesla is expected to be the largest beneficiary of this trend.

Despite the chip crisis, Tesla reported strong deliveries of 254,695 units in second-quarter 2022, 27% year over year. Additionally, TSLA’s energy generation and storage revenues are growing, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products.

TSLA has an expected earnings growth rate of 75.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.8% over the last 7 days.

Chevron is one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve a sustainable production ramp-up. CVX’s existing project pipeline is one of the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. The WTI crude oil price is hovering around $100 per barrel. The price is likely to remain elevated as the Russia-Ukraine conflict is yet to be resolved.

Chevron’s Noble Energy takeover has expanded its footprint in the region and the DJ Basin. CVX now has access to Noble Energy’s low-cost, proven reserves along with cash-generating offshore assets in Israel — particularly the flagship Leviathan natural gas project — thereby boosting its footing in the Mediterranean.

CVX has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 3.9% over the last 30 days.

Exxon Mobil made multiple world-class oil discoveries at the Stabroek Block, located off the coast of Guyana. XOM raised the estimate for discovered recoverable resources from the Stabroek Block to approximately 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels. The WTI crude oil price is hovering around $100 per barrel. The price is likely to remain elevated as the Russia-Ukraine clash continues.

Exxon Mobil’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil behemoth expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business. By then, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%.

Exxon Mobil has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 16.8% over the last 30 days.

NextEra Energy is expanding domestic clean energy assets through acquisitions and organic initiatives. NEE has stakes in natural gas pipelines in Texas and gains from an increase in natural gas production.

To enhance flexibility, NextEra Energy completed a few financing agreements to secure funds for acquisition. NEE benefits from declining installation costs and improving renewable technology. It has sufficient liquidity to meet obligations.

NextEra Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 12.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 7 days.

Visa has undertaken mergers and acquisitions, partnerships, and minority investments to achieve growth. V’s investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.

The coronavirus vaccine rollouts and the gradual revival of consumer confidence should keep driving spending, expanding business volumes in turn. Backed by its strong cash position, Visa remains committed to boosting its shareholder value. V’s balance sheet strength is commendable.

Visa has an expected earnings growth rate of 24.4% for the current year (ending September 2022). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.5% over the last 7 days.

This Is How China Could Hit Back Over Pelosi’s Taiwan Visit You Won’t Like What Comes After Inflation Pelosi Is Expected to Visit Taiwan, Ramping Up US-China Tensions Pelosi Poised to Land in Taiwan as China Rips ‘Provocative’ Trip

It was tempting when Democrats announced their surprise climate deal to imagine American auto executives popping champagne bottles. But any bubbly probably ought to stay on ice until Washington finalizes the fine print of the bill that would lift the cap on tax credits for electric vehicles.

Just three months ago, Senator Joe Manchin said it would be “ludicrous” to extend the $7,500 incentive with inflation running hot and automakers struggling to keep up with demand. That comment all but dashed the hopes of car companies that had been lobbying the Biden administration to lift the 200,000-vehicle limit at which the perk begins to wind down. Tesla, GM and Toyota have crossed that threshold; Nissan and Ford are closing in.

While Wednesday’s news represented sweet relief, it’s still unclear just how stingy this bill will be about eligibility. For EVs to qualify, their batteries will need to contain minerals extracted from or processed in a country the US has a free trade agreement with, and a portion of components to be manufactured or assembled in North America.

This would kick in next year, and the content requirements would be made tougher after 2024. This will be tricky, because while automakers and battery manufacturers are spending billions on new North American factories, many of these facilities are still being planned and constructed. China — America’s trade nemesis — accounts for almost three-quarters of manufacturing capacity for lithium-ion batteries and more than half the world’s capacity to refine lithium.

Manchin may have come around, but he’s setting the bar high for carmakers, requiring them to use a domestic supply chain that hasn’t fully materialized yet.

Story continues

“This ties that noose a little tighter,’’ said Jeff Yambrick, a former executive at Chinese battery maker Svolt, who’s now running a startup that sets up cell factories and supply chains for firms operating in the US. “You have to do things in America.”

The legislative text released this week could change before it wins approval by Congress. But it’s clear Beijing is on Washington’s mind. Manchin himself told Bloomberg’s Steve Dennis that the EV credits are designed to keep China from dominating battery components and critical minerals.

While this level of scrutiny on China is no surprise, it could be a headache for Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and its customers. The giant Chinese company has been scouting factory sites in North America and just reached a deal to supply lithium iron phosphate batteries to power Ford’s Mustang Mach-E sport utility vehicles and F-150 Lightning pickups.

Manchin and his fellow China hawks must be careful not to go too far and set content targets that push the auto industry deeper into the arms of Chinese suppliers, said Abigail Wulf, the director of critical minerals strategy at Securing America’s Future Energy, a Washington-based nonprofit that advocates for US energy independence.

“If this isn’t enacted properly, with the right amount of finesse, we’ll be even more beholden to China,” Wulf said in an interview. “We want to make sure this is workable for the auto companies.”

Bloomberg reached out to seven automakers about the bill, most of which said they’re still getting their arms around it. In its current form, it would lift the EV sales cap at the end of this year and extend availability of the credits by a decade.

“If you look at the landscape as it exists today, it's a challenge, but it's doable,” said Joe Britton, the head of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, which advocates for EV adoption. “We can meet these metrics.”

43,"S&amp;P 500 in Wild Swings as Yields Jump on Hawkish Fed Speak, Geopolitical Tensions","By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 swung between gains and losses Tuesday, on rising geopolitical tensions and a surge in U.S. Treasury yields as Federal Reserve members talked down the prospect of a pause on rate hikes.

The S&P 500 fell 0.16%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.68%, or 224 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.20%.

Geopolitical tensions thatched up a notch in intraday after Chinese battery giant CATL reportedly said it would pause plans to invest billions of dollars in a new U.S. battery plant because of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan.

The House Speaker arrived in Taiwan despite Beijing warning of retaliation over the visit.

Big tech, meanwhile, traded mixed after Treasury yields surged following remarks from Fed members playing down the prospect of the Fed pausing or cutting rates next year.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta J. Mester said it would “take a while to get inflation back to that 2 percent,” and shrugged off worries about the slowing economy, stressing that a slowdown is “necessary.”

The comments arrived just hours after San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the Fed’s job to bring inflation down was “far from done.”

Losses in consumer stocks were kept in check by a jump in Tesla and a jump in cruise stocks.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) cut losses to climb more than 1% - adding to its more than 30% gain seen in July - ahead of the electric automaker’s shareholder meeting on Thursday.

The meeting, which will include a vote on the company’s 3-for-1 stock split proposal, will also be closely watched for any updates on Cybertruck, Tesla’s all-electric pickup truck.

Healthcare stocks were helped by a rally in Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) and Zimmer Biomet Holdings (NYSE:ZBH), with the latter up more than 5% after the medical device company raised its outlook on revenue following better-than-expected quarterly results.

Energy stocks, meanwhile, were flat despite an intraday rebound in oil prices amid uncertainty about whether major oil producers will decide to lift production at a meeting on Wednesday.

Commerzbank said that while the outcome of the OPEC+ meeting is “impossible to predict...there is more to suggest that the current production volume will be left unchanged, which should help prices to stabilize.”

On the earnings front, investors digested mostly positive quarterly results, with Uber the standout performer.

Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) reported its maiden positive cash flow and a revenue that topped expectations offsetting a wider than expected loss to send the share price up more than 17%.

Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), however, reported a miss on revenue as the impact of its exit from Russia, higher costs and a stronger dollar weighed on performance. Its shares fell more than 4%.

Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) jumped more than 12% despite quarterly results falling short of Wall Street estimates as activist investor Elliott Management confirmed that it had become the company’s largest shareholder as it looks to forward to helping the company realize its “full potential.""

In other news, Cowen Group (NASDAQ:COWN) climbed nearly 8% after the financial services firm reportedly agreed to be acquired by TD Bank for $1.3 billion.

45,"Inflation Reduction Act would lead to $1,800 in savings for average household, analysis finds","Sweeping climate and health care legislation unveiled by Democrats last week would lead to significant cuts in energy costs for American households, according to a new analysis.

A report by non-profit group Rewiring America found that the tax incentives included as part of the $369 billion dedicated to climate initiatives in the Inflation Reduction Act would save the average household $1,800 per year on energy bills.

“It is a market-tilting level of investment,” Ari Matusiak, the group's co-founder and CEO who was involved with the crafting of the bill, told Yahoo Finance. “The beneficiaries of [this measure] in the long term are going to be all of us on the planet. In the short term, it’s going to be Americans at their kitchen tables realizing savings on a month-to-month basis.”

The new measure sets out to accelerate the transition to renewable energy and dramatically reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions through a slew of tax incentives aimed at reducing the cost of electrification.

While those cost savings are dolled out among more than 100 different programs, Matusiak said the biggest reductions are likely to come from rebate and credit programs that cushion the cost difference between electric appliances and cars, and those that rely on fossil fuels.

Here are some of the biggest cost savings.

Electrifying households

A program dubbed the High Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act (HEERA) sets aside $4.5 billion in direct rebates for low- and moderate-income households that install new, efficient electric appliances.

Under the proposed rebate framework, a low-income household would receive a rebate of up to $8,000 for a new heat pump, $840 for an electric stove or electric dryer, and $2,500 for updated electrical wiring, among other rebates. Matusiak said those incentives will enable 1 million households to go electric.

“The challenge is that these machines are new and they are not ubiquitous in the market yet, so they have not yet achieved industrial scale, which means that their prices off the showroom floor are higher than the fossil fuel machines that they will be replacing,” he said. “So the investments in the Inflation Reduction Act are directly going at bridging the delta between the cost of an off-the-showroom fossil fuel machine versus a clean electric machine.”

Credits for EV purchases

The climate legislation also sets aside new money for a $7500 federal vehicle tax credit, expected to give major car makers like Tesla (TSLA) and GM (GM) an added lift, along with drivers.

While the credit for new electric vehicles is seen as an extension of an existing program, the clean vehicle credit program comes with additional conditions, including a requirement that eligible cars be built with materials sourced and processed in a country that the U.S. has a free trade agreement with. It also requires the battery used to include a large number of components manufactured in North America.

In addition, the legislation sets aside a $4,000 tax credit for used cars for the first time. The income threshold would be capped at $300,000 in adjusted gross income for joint filers or $150,000 for individual filers. Credits would be capped at an income level of $75,000 and $150,000 for used cars. A line of Tesla cars charge on July 17, 2022 in Nephi, Utah. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)

The incentives come as drivers increasingly look toward electric alternatives in the face of historically high gas prices. While the national average for a gallon of gasoline fell to $4.19 on Tuesday, according to AAA, the cost to drive an EV averages out to $1.06 a gallon, Matusiak said.

“41% of the inflation that consumers are experiencing are because their energy bills directly are going up at the pump and at their kitchen table,"" he said. ""And electrifying the machines that we use in our day-to-day lives structures that inflation out of our lives forever. So it is not just about whether you're going to get to that $1,800 number this year, but it's whether you are going to reduce the amount of money that you spend on energy year over year for the next 20 years.”

Matusiak also pointed to additional credits that allow homeowners to deduct up to 30% of the cost of energy efficient upgrades to their homes, as all part of the $1,800 cost savings estimated.

Impact to inflation

Economists remain divided on the impact of the legislation on inflation.

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who has been critical of the impact the Biden administration’s pandemic stimulus has had on inflation, has publicly supported the bill, saying it would fight inflation by reducing the budget deficit significantly over time.

“You’re raising more than $2.00 in revenue for every dollar that you spend,” he told CNN. Skye Weyrauch, her mother Diane, and niece make their way along Larchmont Blvd. in Los Angeles, June 11, 2022. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)

Meanwhile, a study by the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated the legislation would “very slightly increase inflation” until 2024 before pulling back. The report released Friday “indicated low confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation.”

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) said the new measure amounted to the largest deficit reduction bill since 2011, calling it “welcome improvement” with inflation at a 40-year high.

“In the near term, people are going to see their costs go down because lower energy costs and because health premiums aren’t going to rise,” Marc Goldwein, CRFB’s senior director of policy, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “That’s not actually anti-inflationary in itself. But it can be anti-inflationary to the extent that those things are paid for, so they’re not putting more money into the economy, and to the extent that they help with expectation.”

47,5 Best Stocks That Led the Rally in Nasdaq ETF,"The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index logged in the best month since April 2020, rallying 12.3% in July and showing an astounding comeback from the heavy sell-off led by soaring yields. Invesco QQQ QQQ, which serves as a proxy to the index, gained 11.3% last month.

Though most of the stocks in QQQ’s portfolio have risen, information technology and consumer discretionary stocks led the way higher. These include Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Tesla TSLA, KLA Corporation KLAC, Lam Research LRCX and Netflix NFLX.

Better-than-expected results, declining commodity prices, and falling bond yields brought back the lure for the riskier assets. In particular, the tech sector, which was the biggest victim of surging yields, was the outperformer. The 10-year yield dropped to 2.6% from 3% over the past month in the face of deteriorating economic conditions and recession fears.

Through Jul 29, Q2 results from 279 S&P 500 members or 55.8% of the index’s total membership are up 4.7% on 14.1% higher revenues, with 75.6% beating EPS estimates and 65.6% beating revenue estimates, per the latest Earnings Trends. This is faring better than expected and almost in line with the Q1 earnings and revenue growth of 5% and 14.1%, respectively (read: Stocks' Best Month Since 2020: Top ETF Areas of July).

Additionally, the easing of the prospect of aggressive tightening policy has bolstered investor sentiment. The world's largest economy is poised for a technical recession as GDP shrank by 0.9% in the second quarter, followed by a 1.6% decline in the first quarter. This might prompt the Fed to scale back its interest rate hiking cycle in the fall, resulting in risk-on trade.

Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of QQQ.

QQQ in Focus

Invesco QQQ provides exposure to the 102 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq by tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index. Information technology accounts for 50.6% of the assets, while consumer discretionary and communication services make up for a 16.4% and 16% share, respectively.

Invesco QQQ is one of the largest and most-popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $168.7 billion and an average daily volume of around 56 million shares. Invesco QQQ charges investors 20 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.

Below, we have highlighted the above-mentioned five stocks in the ETF with their respective positions in the fund’s basket.

48,"CVS Health, Moderna, Services Activity: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer

Investing.com -- Stocks were weighed down by worries over China-U.S. relations on Tuesday amid House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.

Also weighing on stocks: comments by various Federal Reserve officials that tossed some cold water on the notion that the Fed was close to backing off from its aggressive interest rate hikes.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta J. Mester said it would “take a while"" to get inflation back to the Fed's 2% target and said an economic slowdown was necessary. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the Fed’s job to bring inflation down was “far from done.” The Fed next meets in September.

Corporate earnings continued to pour in, with more set for Wednesday and later this week. In economic data, investors are waiting for the July jobs report on Friday, after job openings data on Tuesday fell short of expectations amid a cooling off in the labor market. Analysts expect Friday's jobs report to show the economy added 250,000 nonfarm jobs in July, which would be down from 372,000 the prior month.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders meet Thursday to vote on the electric vehicle maker's 3-for-1 stock split.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. CVS Health earnings

CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) is expected to report earnings per share of $2.18 on revenue of $76.4 billion.

2. Moderna earnings

Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) is expected to report earnings per share of $4.54 on revenue of $4.07 billion.

3. Services activity

The ISM non-manufacturing business activity reading for July is due out at 10:00 AM ET. Analysts expect it to say 54, which would be down from 56.1 the prior month.

Investing.com -- The Dow fell Tuesday, weighed down by rising geopolitical tensions and a slip in Caterpillar on weaker-than-expected revenue.

You can’t have a list of EV stocks, and not include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

After plunging from about $1,100 to support around $680, the EV stock is starting to accelerate higher. Last trading near $900, I’d like to see it back at $1,100 in the near term.

In its most recent quarter, the numbers allayed some concerns. The company beat on both the top and bottom lines. In fact, according to Wedbush analysts Dan Ives and John Katsingris, “The quarter was better than feared with healthy guidance for 2H by Musk & Co. that look achievable with no margin for error.”

“The electric automaker’s revenue took a significant quarter-over-quarter hit in Q2, falling from $18.76 billion in Q1 2022, but rose year-over-year from $11.95 billion,” reported Yahoo Finance.

Another hot EV stock is Nio (NYSE:NIO).

In recent weeks, Nio fell from about $24 to under $20, where it appears to have caught strong support. From the current price, I’d like to see it again challenge prior resistance around $24 a share.

Helping it toward that goal, in June, the company delivered 12,691 vehicles, up 60.3% over the year-ago quarter. Also, during its full second quarter, it delivered a total of 25,059 vehicles, an increase of over 14%.

In addition, China has rolled out new incentives to improve demand for EVs, including lower loan rates.

NIO also just confirmed its annual general meeting for Aug. 25. Better, the company is still on track to expand into Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark. Plus, the company just forecast second-quarter revenue growth of 10.6% to 19.4% year over year.

Investors may also want to consider Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI).

After rocketing from about $20 to $41, the EV stock pulled back to around $33. While slightly overbought at the moment, I believe the stock could accelerate to higher highs.

In its second quarter, the company said it delivered 28,687 vehicles. That’s 63.2% growth year over year. The company also just unveiled its Li L9 in June, which could boost deliveries in the fourth quarter and through 2023.

Li Auto already has over 30,000 pre-bookings for the L9, according to a recent company press release.

Earnings have been just as impressive. According to the company, vehicle sales came in at $1.47 billion in Q1 2022, an increase of about 168.7% year over year. Vehicle margins came in at 22.3% in Q1 2022, as compared to 16.9% year over year. Total revenues soared 167.5% to $1.51 billion. Gross profits were up about 251% to $341.3 million.

Oversold, shares of Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) appear to have just bottomed out around $24.87. Better, RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R appear to have bottomed out as well. From a current price of $24.87, I’d like to see the XPEV stock again challenge $36.

In recent weeks, the company reported June deliveries of 15,295 Smart EVs – a 133% increase over the same month last year, and a 51% increase month over month. For the second quarter, XPEV delivered 34,422 Smart EVs. Year to date, deliveries ran to 68,983 – a 124% jump year over year.

Even better, the company is quickly expanding in Europe, with locations in Sweden and the Netherlands. In addition, in August, the company will start accepting preorders for its new G9 SUV followed by a launch in September.

One of the best ways to diversify among EV stocks at less cost is with an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, such as the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV). With an expense ratio of 0.68%, or $68 per $10,000 invested annually, this ETF invests in “companies involved in the development of autonomous vehicle technology, electric vehicles (“EVs”), and EV components and materials. This includes companies involved in the development of autonomous vehicle software and hardware, as well as companies that produce EVs, EV components such as lithium batteries, and critical EV materials such as lithium and cobalt,” as noted by Global X.

With this ETF, investors have exposure to EV and autonomous stocks, such as Tesla, Nio, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), for example. It also does so at less cost. For example, if you were to buy 10 shares of every listed stock, it would cost thousands. However, with this ETF you can gain exposure at under $25 a share.

By Aniruddha Ghosh and Devik Jain

Aug 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes fell in choppy trading on Tuesday on rising U.S.-China tensions as House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's support to a democratic Taiwan prompted China to announce ""targeted military operations"".

The latest geopolitical uncertainty comes at a time when financial markets are struggling to grapple with the fallout of the Ukraine war, an energy crisis in Europe, soaring inflation and tightening financial conditions.

Shares of chipmakers with a large exposure to China struggled to gain, while industrial bellwether Caterpillar added to the slide, dropping 4.5% as slowing construction activity in the world's second largest economy added to its supply-chain woes.

""China will retaliate in some way. I don't think we're going to get into a physical war but there's going to be some type of retaliation - it could be on the trade front or on a number of things,"" said Dennis Dick, retail trader at Triple D Trading.

Shares of U.S. defense companies Raytheon Technologies Corp , Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and L3Harris Technologies Inc rose between 1.4% and 2.9%. The United States is Taiwan's main supporter and arms supplier.

""This market just wants an excuse to buy stocks, there's this fear of missing out that is going on right now,"" Dick said.

At 14:06 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 263.12 points, or 0.80%, at 32,535.28, the S&P 500 was down 11.46 points, or 0.28%, at 4,107.17, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.64 points, or 0.01%, at 12,370.62.

The CBOE volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, eased from the day's high of 24.68 points and the Philadelphia SE semiconductor index erased early losses to add 0.4%.

A largely upbeat second-quarter reporting season has supported markets recently, with the benchmark S&P 500 index up more than 13% from lows hit in mid-June.

Uber Technologies Inc jumped 16.8% after the ride-hailing firm reported positive quarterly cash flow for the first time ever and forecast upbeat third-quarter operating profit.

Tesla Inc gained 2.1% after Citigroup hiked its price target on the electric-car maker's stock saying it is constructive on Tesla's leading premium EV position.

Pinterest Inc surged 11.4% as the activist investor Elliott Investment Management become the largest shareholder of the digital pin-board firm.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.12-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 30 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 36 new highs and 60 new lows. (Reporting by Aniruddha Ghosh and Devik Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Arun Koyyur)",2022-08-02T18:11:51+00:00,2022-08-02

56,10 Cryptocurrencies Redditors Will Never Buy Again,"In this article, we discuss the 10 cryptocurrencies Redditors will never buy again. If you want to skip our discussion on the cryptocurrency market, go directly to the 5 Cryptocurrencies Redditors Will Never Buy Again.

The year 2021 saw the cryptocurrency market record historic gains. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies hit a high of about $3 trillion in November 2021. However, only two months later, the market cap dropped by 40%, wiping off more than $1.2 trillion. Market volatility and increased regulatory scrutiny have dimmed cryptocurrencies’ prospects lately. Experts have cautioned that a further decline in the market may be imminent. The co-founder of Absolute Strategy Research, Ian Harnett, believes Bitcoin is likely to touch the $13000 level in 2022, reflecting a decrease of around 40% from the present price. Ian highlighted that Bitcoin follows a trend of declining 80% from its all-time high after each crypto rally. For example, the cryptocurrency plunged to nearly $3,000 in 2018 after peaking at around $20,000 towards the end of 2017.

The cryptocurrency market is tense as investors consider how increasing interest rates would affect assets that thrived during a time of a relaxed monetary policy. In an effort to rein in spiraling inflation without triggering a recession, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points for the second time on July 27. Since the Fed started utilizing the overnight funds rate as its central instrument of monetary policy in the 1990s, the movements in June and July constitute the most rigorous consecutive action taken by the authorities. Prior to the interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, the cryptocurrency market was already in turmoil, with investors alarmed due to the $60 billion crash of the well-known stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token Luna. Fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market send shockwaves across numerous industries as notable companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have significant exposure to the crypto market.

Ponzi Scheme

The increasing number of fraudulent schemes and scams in the crypto market has also contributed to investors having a bearish outlook on many cryptocurrencies. According to the Federal Trade Commission’s report, investors have faced a cumulative loss of more than $1 billion from the start of 2021 to March 2022. Bitcoin accounted for 70% of cryptocurrency-related scams; Tether made up for 10% of the scams, while Ethereum’s contribution stood at 9%. In the most recent instance, 11 people were charged by US authorities for their involvement in a massive cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that deceived retail investors worldwide out of more than $300 million. The accusations, which concern a Ponzi scam named Forsage that has been running for over two years, were made public by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 1. The agency filed charges against a number of marketers and suspected founders of the Ponzi scheme.

There are currently more than 19,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation around the world. The magnitude of this figure can be gauged by the fact that the number of cryptocurrencies in circulation is three times greater than the stocks listed on the markets in the US. For a potential investor, it is nearly impossible to track down the fundamentals and performance of each of the coins. Most investors are only able to keep up with the performance of notable coins like Bitcoin USD (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum USD (CCC:ETH-USD), which makes it very challenging for investors to pinpoint which cryptocurrencies to buy and avoid. This is where the power of the Reddit community and the wisdom of the crowd comes into play.

Our Methodology

With this context in mind, we have curated a list of 10 cryptocurrencies Redditors will never buy again. We will look at the reasons for the investors making this call on these currencies. We have referred to notable subreddits like r/CryptoCurrency, r/CryptoCurrencyTrading, r/CryptoMarkets, and r/altcoin. to shortlist the currencies.

10. Celo USD (CCC:CELO-USD)

Market Capitalization: $472.02 million

Celo USD (CCC:CELO-USD) is a blockchain ecosystem that was launched in April 2020 to increase the adoption of cryptocurrency by smartphone users. The blockchain network uses a telephone number as the public key and allows the user of a smartphone to conduct transactions in cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency platform claims to have the fastest transactions per the second potential of 140,000 transactions. The Reddit community thinks of this claim as comical and a false marketing strategy similar to Solana USD (CCC:SOL-USD). Users think that such claims should be monitored because potential investors and decentralized applications (dApps) look at such numbers and divert their resources towards these platforms accordingly. Redditors have also gone on to say that lawsuits should be filed and damages should be claimed against Celo USD (CCC:CELO-USD) for creating strategies intended to benefit certain groups. The cryptocurrency has an all-time low and high of $0.7955 and $10.66, respectively.

9. Loopring USD (CCC:LRC-USD)

Market Capitalization: $568.09 million

Loopring USD (CCC:LRC-USD) is an audited, non-custodial, and open-sourced platform aimed at creating decentralized crypto exchanges and payment protocols based on the Ethereum blockchain network.

Reddit users claim that there is an absence of proper communication from the management at Loopring to its audience on Reddit and Discord platforms. Furthermore, Loopring USD (CCC:LRC-USD) has failed to deliver on its promises as it was unable to get LRC as a payment method on the NFT marketplace launched by GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) on June 11. Loopring USD (CCC:LRC-USD) also reversed the decision to have an in-house zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) development team. The decision of not having a zkEVM development team in-house has been considered a red flag by the Reddit community. The development team was supposed to be a significant milestone that would have taken Loopring USD (CCC:LRC-USD) a level above all the other level two solutions on the Ethereum blockchain. It would have increased the value of Loopring USD (CCC:LRC-USD) as a token. Since the start of 2022, the cryptocurrency has lost more than 79% of its value.

8. Curve DAO Token USD (CCC:CRV-USD)

Market Capitalization: $696.89 million

Curve DAO Token USD (CCC:CRV-USD) was launched in January 2020 and is used on the Curve DAO platform for governance purposes.

Curve DAO is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that plays the role of an automated market maker (AMM) and provides the best possible exchange rates. DEX is focused on stablecoins like Tether USD (CCC:USDT-USD), USD Coin USD (CCC:USDC-USD), and Binance USD (CCC:BUSD-USD). The values of all these stablecoins are connected to an asset in the real world.

The maximum supply of Curve DAO Token USD (CCC:CRV-USD) is set at 3.3 billion units, and the distribution mechanism is highlighted in the project’s whitepaper. The token is currently trading at around the $1.3327 level. This reflects that the coin has lost over 97% of its value from an all-time high of $60.50 experienced in August 2020. Reddit users think it’s unlikely for Curve DAO Token USD (CCC:CRV-USD) to be able to achieve the same levels again.

7. THORChain USD (CCC:RUNE-USD)

Market Capitalization: $864.43 million

THORChain USD (CCC:RUNE-USD) is the native cryptocurrency on THORChain. It is a decentralized liquidity platform that permits investors to conveniently exchange their cryptocurrency assets through a diversified range of networks without giving up complete custody of the assets during the process.

The Reddit community highlighted that the THORChain platform uses a multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet, which is considered inefficient and very slow based on its transaction speed. To overcome this shortcoming, THORChain funds individual nodes to complete the majority of transactions. This gives the nodes complete control over the funds. If any funds are stolen, THORChain just slashes the amount away without taking into consideration the amount present with them.

Furthermore, THORChain has slip-based pools, and in case of a mass exit, the remaining users would be forced to pay huge slip fees, which would slow down the process of investors exiting their position.

6. Helium USD (CCC:HNT-USD)

Market Capitalization: $1.142 billion

Helium USD (CCC:HNT-USD) is the native cryptocurrency on the Helium Blockchain that is expanding its presence through the People’s Network. The People’s Network is a decentralized wireless infrastructure with a presence through 911,000 hotspots.

The blockchain network has come under attack from famous angel investor Liron Shapira. The CEO and co-founder of Relationship Hero claim that only $6,500 worth of Helium USD (CCC:HNT-USD) was generated monthly for investors who have invested hundreds of millions in the firm. Mr. Shapira claims that users who have spent $400 to $800 on hotspot nodes are complaining about weak returns and are receiving only $20 per month as opposed to anticipated returns of $100 per month. Even out of the $20, the investors are getting only one cent as the remaining $19.99 is diverted towards growing the network by the Helium Blockchain.

On the other hand, Reddit users are claiming that the company behind Helium is receiving 30 million Helium USD (CCC:HNT-USD) tokens annually. As of July 29, the value of these tokens stood at $300 million. It must be noted that these tokens do not have an end-user demand and are thus used by retail speculators. There are over 124.5 million Helium USD (CCC:HNT-USD) coins in supply currently.

The bearish outlook on cryptocurrencies like Helium USD (CCC:HNT-USD) has also been a cause of concern for famous companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to their significant investments in the crypto market.

57,Tesla: The Biggest Winner From Joe Manchin’s Inflation Reduction Act,"In case you haven't heard yet, Senate Democrats are working on a compromise bill aimed at slowing the rise in healthcare costs while at the same time slowing the growth of carbon emissions to the atmosphere -- the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Valued at some $739 billion in new spending, with some tax tweaks to help pay for it, the IRA proposes allocating (among other things) roughly $369 billion to slowing climate change, including by offering expanded $7,500 federal tax credits for purchases of new electric cars (and a brand new program of $4,000 credits for purchases of used electric cars).

There are caveats to the tax credit program: Buyers can only claim them if their individual income is less than $150,000 (for the new electric cars) or less than $75,000 (for used cars), for example. Super-luxury electric vehicles won't get rebates at all. Electric pickups and SUVs have to cost less than $80,000 to qualify for a rebate, for example; electric sedans less than $55,000; and used EVs of any stripe can't cost more than $25,000.

Still, it's a generous program -- with another big caveat of especial interest to investors.

As Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas points out, President Biden was quite clear that he only wants these rebates to be available for cars that are ""made in America."" And this protectionist quirk of the legislation (assuming it passes in its present form) could be especially favorable to EV leader Tesla (TSLA), which boasts ""the highest US-sourced content of any OEM"" automotive manufacturer in the United states at 62% U.S. content in its cars. Honda Motor Company(HMC), believe it or not, is No. 2 with 55% U.S. content, followed by Netherlands-based Stellantis (STLA) at 46%.

For Tesla investors, this story gets even better -- reinforcing Jonas's view that Tesla stock deserves an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating and $1,150 price target. You see, if you focus in on the top 10 best-selling EV models right now (some of which are getting sales boosts from existing government tax credits, in contrast to Tesla, which has run through its quota of tax credits already), neither Honda nor Stellantis even place in that top 10. Instead, in addition to Tesla, car companies ranking in the top 10 for EV sales include:

Story continues

Ford (F), with U.S. content of only 39% in its automobiles. Nissan -- with 24%. Kia -- with 12%. Hyundai -- with 7%. And Audi with ... 1% U.S. domestic content.

What does this imply, you ask? Not to put too fine a point on it, but aside from Tesla, which boasts both popular EV models and huge U.S. content in those models -- which should help its car buyers to claim those tax rebates -- the competition largely comprises either (i) car companies that have significant U.S. content, but don't have popular EVs; or (ii) car companies that have popular EVs, but lack much U.S. content -- and so probably won't qualify for rebates.

Incidentally, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, ""made in the U.S.A."" generally requires more than 50% U.S. content in an automobile. Tesla's got that in the bag -- and Tesla's competitors have their work cut out for them.

There are 31 analyst reviews on record for TSLA, including 18 Buys, 6 Holds, and 7 Sells, giving the stock a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The Tesla bears, though, are having a big impact on the average price target; at $873 and change, the figure implies shares will remain rangebound for the foreseeable future.

59,Pelosi’s Taiwan Trip Spurs Chinese Battery Giant to Pause Plant Debut,"(Bloomberg) -- A giant Chinese supplier of electric-vehicle batteries decided to push back announcing a multibillion-dollar North American plant to supply Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co. due to tensions raised by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan, according to people familiar with the matter.

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s biggest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, has been considering at least two locations in Mexico near the Texas border, as well as sites in the US, for the plant. China’s CATL has been in an advanced stage of site selection and negotiating incentives, in anticipation of announcing its selection in the coming weeks.

CATL now plans to wait until September or October to make the announcement, the people familiar with the process said Tuesday, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The concern is that an announcement could stoke tensions at a sensitive time in US-China ties amid the controversial Pelosi visit to Taiwan, they said.

A representative for CATL didn’t respond to requests for comment. Tesla also didn’t respond to requests for comment. Ford declined to comment.

Shares of Tesla pared an intraday climb as high as 3.6% to close up 1.1% at $901.76 in New York. Ford fell into negative territory after midday gains, declining 1.2% to $15.16.

Pelosi landed in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, on Tuesday evening local time in the face of threats and opposition from China, which regards Taiwan as part of its territory. Pelosi’s trip makes her the highest-ranking US politician to visit the island in 25 years, and Chinese officials have called it “provocative.”

Story continues

CATL’s headquarters are in Fujian, across the Taiwan Strait from the island. China has announced military exercises will take place around the island this week in response to Pelosi’s visit to Taipei.

Bloomberg News reported last month that CATL is considering Ciudad Juarez, in the state of Chihuahua, and Saltillo, in Coahuila, and that the company is contemplating an investment of as much $5 billion in the project. Sites in the US and Mexico are still under active consideration, and there’s no intention to walk away from the plan, the people said.

CATL is also weighing the need to establish a North America site alongside the potential impact of a US legislative package being brokered between Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin, the people said.

This Is How China Could Hit Back Over Pelosi’s Taiwan Visit Pelosi Poised to Land in Taiwan as China Rips ‘Provocative’ Trip World’s Most-Tracked Plane Is Jet That May Be Flying Pelosi They Quit Goldman’s Star Trading Team, Then the Bank Raised Alarms

An extension of the popular $7,500 tax credit available to EV buyers was included in the surprise breakthrough deal reached by Senator Joe Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer last week. Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, has long been a skeptic of the credit, dismissing it as “ludicrous” and arguing that it subsidizes production of Chinese-made batteries.

The extension was a huge win for companies such as General Motors Co. and Tesla Inc. that had reached a 200,000-EV-sales threshold at which the perk begins to phase out. But to win Manchin’s support, the credits also included tough new limits on how much the EVs can cost, how much income their buyers can earn, and where the batteries and vehicles are made. With the Senate seeking to pass the hard-fought compromise bill in coming days, automakers are running out of time to get the tax-credit rules tweaked.

“Unfortunately, after they are implemented, at this point it looks like companies won’t be able to use them in the short run,” Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat who has been instrumental in the negotiations over the credits, said in an interview.

Limiting the credit could hamper President Biden’s ambitious goal of making 50% of new-vehicle sales emission-free by 2030, a move he said was needed to help curb ever-worsening climate change. Anyone seeking big changes to the climate and spending package face long odds because of the momentum among Senate Democrats who have been seeking a deal that Manchin would bless for over year.

Story continues

So far, automakers aren’t making much headway, with senators unwilling to consider any substantial changes that would upset support for the bill, according to people familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified.

Content Restrictions

Among the restrictions of most concern: Requirements that would render EVs made with any battery components manufactured by China and other “foreign entities of concern” ineligible to receive the credit after 2023. And beginning in 2025, that prohibition extends to the use of any critical mineral in a battery that is extracted or processed by those countries.

That could pose a big hurdle to automakers who have a connection to the Chinese supply chain. The processing of critical minerals typically used in EV batteries, such as lithium, nickel cobalt, and manganese, is done almost exclusively in China, Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute at the Colorado School of Mines, said in an interview.

“The processing piece is an enormous issue for all of this,” Bazilian said. “What battery manufacturers need is processed chemicals, not rocks.”

Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Stellantis NV are lobbying for more time to comply with those content requirements, according to people familiar with the matter. The companies are making their case to lawmakers including Manchin, Schumer and Stabenow to extend the start of those requirements by multiple years, the people said.

Other automakers, such as electric car maker Rivian Automotive LLC, are lobbying to extend the transition time before new limits on vehicle price and income for buyers take affect. The Senate spending deal would cap the credit to an income level of $150,000 for a single filing taxpayer and $300,000 for joint filers for new vehicles. It also includes a cap on the suggested retail price of eligible vehicles of $55,000 for new cars and $80,000 for pickups and SUVs.

That effectively excludes many Rivian models, which cross that price point as options to the vehicles are added, James Chen, vice president of public policy for Rivian, said in an interview. The company has sold roughly 7,000 vehicles, far from the existing 200,000 vehicle cap, but the new limits would take affect starting in 2023.

“If the legislation is passed as drafted it pulls the rug out -- it cuts Rivian out entirely,” said Chen. “Congress is throwing up a big stop sign to American-made electric trucks and SUVs.”

Sales Cap

General Motors said it’s eager to remove the 200,000-vehicle limit for individual manufacturers -- a level that both it and Tesla hit in 2018, triggering a phaseout on the credit available to buyers of their EVs. “We remain hopeful that Congress will advance legislation to address energy and economic security that includes a modification to the EV tax credit,” a GM spokesman said in an email.

Discussions about potential tweaks to the credit are ongoing, Senator Gary Peters, another Michigan Democrat, said in an interview. But any changes to the fragile deal could be fraught. Manchin, whose opposition earlier prompted Democrats to ax a proposed $4,500 addition to the credit, has very publicly railed against the incentive, arguing it would subsidize Chinese battery producers.

“We’re making our batteries for our cars to be here, made in America, before you get any credits whatsoever,” Manchin said on CNN Sunday. The deal he eventually agreed to also includes billions in funding for the construction of new clean-vehicle manufacturing facilities and other incentives to help automakers comply.

The underlying legislation, which over all contains some $370 billion in funding for tax credits and other measures to combat climate change, also includes aid to help automakers develop a domestic battery supply chain.

It includes as much as $20 billion in loans for the construction of new clean-vehicle manufacturing facilities, $2 billion in grants to retool existing auto-manufacturing facilities to make clean vehicles and a $10 billion investment tax credit to build clean-technology production sites, according to a summary of the bill by the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

“Nearly every part of the effort to secure our supply chain is getting some level of support in the bill,” Joe Britton, the head of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said in an interview.

Anyone seeking big changes to the climate and spending package face long odds because of the momentum among Senate Democrats who have been seeking a deal that Manchin would bless for over year.

So far, automakers aren’t making much headway, with senators unwilling to consider any substantial changes that would upset support for the bill, according to people familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified.

Content Restrictions

Among the restrictions of most concern: Requirements that would render EVs made with any battery components manufactured by China and other “foreign entities of concern” ineligible to receive the credit after 2023. And beginning in 2025, that prohibition extends to the use of any critical mineral in a battery that is extracted or processed by those countries.

That could pose a big hurdle to automakers who have a connection to the Chinese supply chain. The processing of critical minerals typically used in EV batteries, such as lithium, nickel cobalt, and manganese, is done almost exclusively in China, Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute at the Colorado School of Mines, said in an interview.

“The processing piece is an enormous issue for all of this,” Bazilian said. “What battery manufacturers need is processed chemicals, not rocks.”

Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Stellantis NV are lobbying for more time to comply with those content requirements, according to people familiar with the matter. The companies are making their case to lawmakers including Manchin, Schumer and Stabenow to extend the start of those requirements by multiple years, the people said.

Other automakers, such as electric car maker Rivian Automotive LLC, are lobbying to extend the transition time before new limits on vehicle price and income for buyers take affect. The Senate spending deal would cap the credit to an income level of $150,000 for a single filing taxpayer and $300,000 for joint filers for new vehicles. It also includes a cap on the suggested retail price of eligible vehicles of $55,000 for new cars and $80,000 for pickups and SUVs.

That effectively excludes many Rivian models, which cross that price point as options to the vehicles are added, James Chen, vice president of public policy for Rivian, said in an interview. The company has sold roughly 7,000 vehicles, far from the existing 200,000 vehicle cap, but the new limits would take affect starting in 2023.

“If the legislation is passed as drafted it pulls the rug out -- it cuts Rivian out entirely,” said Chen. “Congress is throwing up a big stop sign to American-made electric trucks and SUVs.”

Sales Cap

General Motors said it’s eager to remove the 200,000-vehicle limit for individual manufacturers -- a level that both it and Tesla hit in 2018, triggering a phaseout on the credit available to buyers of their EVs. “We remain hopeful that Congress will advance legislation to address energy and economic security that includes a modification to the EV tax credit,” a GM spokesman said in an email.

Discussions about potential tweaks to the credit are ongoing, Senator Gary Peters, another Michigan Democrat, said in an interview. But any changes to the fragile deal could be fraught. Manchin, whose opposition earlier prompted Democrats to ax a proposed $4,500 addition to the credit, has very publicly railed against the incentive, arguing it would subsidize Chinese battery producers.

“We’re making our batteries for our cars to be here, made in America, before you get any credits whatsoever,” Manchin said on CNN Sunday. The deal he eventually agreed to also includes billions in funding for the construction of new clean-vehicle manufacturing facilities and other incentives to help automakers comply.

Brookfield’s new venture capital arm put $250 million into Musk’s $7.1 billion equity raise for the deal in May. Twitter’s lawyers want to know about the terms of that investment and the billionaire’s efforts to syndicate the package, according to court filings Tuesday in Delaware.

Twitter demanded information from more than a dozen firms besides Brookfield, including DFJ Growth IV Partners, Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity Management & Research and Andreessen’s AH Capital Management, according to the filings.

The social media company also sought information from investor Key Wealth Advisors on Jason Calacanis, Steve Jurvetson, Joe Lonsdale, Chamath Palihapitiya, Keith Rabois and David Sacks. The Washington Post on Monday reported that subpoenas had gone out seeking information on those investors, some of whom weren’t previously known to have been involved in the deal.

Bloomberg LP, which owns Bloomberg News, has invested in Andreessen Horowitz.

As the agreement between Musk and Twitter was coming together, Calacanis had canvassed his network of wealthy investors to solicit backing for the deal. “We are now collecting interest to invest in Twitter, with Elon Musk’s plan to take it private,” he wrote in a May 11 message seen by Bloomberg with the subject “Twitter interest.” He asked investors to get back to him that night. It’s unclear how much interest he got.

Story continues

The pretrial request for information seeks a wide range of communications and documents about Musk’s bid to acquire Twitter for $54.20 a share, which he is seeking to undo over claims the company failed to provide him with information about spam and bot accounts. Twitter also has hit a list of banks involved in Musk’s financing package with a round of subpoenas about their involvement.

Some decried the effort as overly broad, with Lonsdale calling it “a giant harassing fishing expedition” and complaining of a “YOU ARE HEREBY COMMANDED” notice.

Many of those investors know Musk from his days at PayPal, which he ran until his ouster in 2000. Rabois and Sacks were PayPal executives, and Lonsdale once worked as a PayPal intern. Jurvetson, who has been friends with Musk for years, holds a board seat at SpaceX and previously held one at Tesla Inc., both run by Musk.

Calacanis is also in Musk’s orbit, and hosts a podcast called All-In, with Sacks and Palihapitiya among its hosts. At a recent All-In conference in Miami, Musk dialed in to speak and spent some of the time casting doubt on Twitter’s numbers.

Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick has scheduled a five-day trial starting on Oct. 17 in Wilmington.

The case is Twitter v. Musk, 22-0613, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

The US House Speaker is meeting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Chairman Mark Liu on Wednesday to discuss Congress’ recently passed Chips and Science Act and its $52 billion in subsidies for new chip manufacturing plants on American soil, according to a Washington Post report. It’s a notable stop in an itinerary otherwise packed with government agencies and symbolic photo ops and underscores not just the strategic importance of the island, but its outsized technological weight in the global economy.

Taiwan is home to industry-leading chip factories as well as an industrial base that supplies key components for electronics, medical equipment and sensitive nuclear power and military use. US officials have said that Beijing gaining access to the technology and expertise housed in Taiwan constitutes a security risk. China, which considers Taiwan a region under its jurisdiction, has called the Speaker’s visit to the island “provocative.”

A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment on Pelosi’s trip to the island. The Hsinchu-based chipmaker is the exclusive supplier of Apple Inc.’s Silicon processors for iPhones and Mac PCs as well as the manufacturing partner of other US companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. TSMC is now building a $12 billion fab in Arizona to help boost chip production on US soil, but it still makes the majority of its chips and all of its cutting-edge semiconductors at home.

This Is How China Could Hit Back Over Pelosi’s Taiwan Visit

In response to Pelosi’s visit, Beijing announced four days of live-fire military drills in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The announcement included six exclusion zones encircling Taiwan, blocking ships and aircraft from passing through large swaths of water and airspace and triggering concern that the drills will hamper shipments and exacerbate supply chain issues.

The Taiwan Strait is one of the world’s busiest shipping routes and is the primary path for ships passing from China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to westward destinations. Even a minor disruption can mean critical delays for businesses, hospitals and utilities. Asia-based companies like Sony Group Corp. have battled logistics snarls since the start of the pandemic and any further disruption is liable to impact global distribution of key products.

TSMC and peers like Samsung Electronics Co. have had to strike a balance between the US and China, as Washington’s attempts to thwart Beijing’s technological ambitions escalate. Part of the Chips and Science Act passed this week said that companies receiving funding must promise not to boost production of advanced chips in China.

Following Pelosi’s arrival, China halted natural sand exports -- used to make glass and concrete -- to Taiwan, along with imports of some fish and fruit. Chinese electric-vehicle battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. has also decided to push back its announcement of a North American factory to supply Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co., Bloomberg News reported.

69,GM doubles miles open to its Super Cruise technology,"By Joseph White

DETROIT(Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Wednesday owners of certain vehicles equipped with its Super Cruise assisted driving system will now be able to use it on 400,000 miles (643,740 km) of North American roads, doubling the current operating area as Tesla and other automakers race to deploy hands-free cruising technology.

GM's Super Cruise system, like Tesla Inc's Autopilot system, is a driver assistance system, and does not enable true autonomous driving. Spurred by Tesla's aggressive deployment of Autopilot, and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk's promises of a more advanced ""Full Self Driving"" system, GM, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Mercedes-Benz AG are racing to deploy competing partial automation technology in major markets.

At the same time, safety regulators are showing concern that drivers do not understand that Autopilot and similar systems are not designed to take over driving in every circumstance.

The GM system's sensors and software allow a motorist to cruise with hands off the wheel on highways that have been mapped in detail. But the driver is expected to stay alert and ready to take over the car. GM uses technology to monitor the driver, and Super Cruise will sound alarms or slow the car to a stop if it detects that a driver is not responding.

Starting later this year, GM plans to enable vehicles equipped with Super Cruise and the company's latest vehicle electronic system to operate hands-free on major, undivided highways in the United States and Canada, as well as additional miles of divided, interstate highways. Currently, Super Cruise operates only on interstate, divided highways.

The expansion, enabled by wider digital mapping, will allow owners of properly equipped GM vehicles to cruise hands-free on stretches of Route 66 in the U.S. West or the Trans-Canada highway in Western Canada, GM said.

Many of the new roads GM has mapped are in rural, heartland states where GM pickup trucks are popular. GM plans to offer Super Cruise as an option on its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra large pickups later this year. GM has said previously it intends to offer Super Cruise as an option on 22 models by the end of 2023.

Depending on the model, Super Cruise costs $2,200 to $2,500 to add as an option.

Chicago, IL – August 3, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla Inc. TSLA, NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, Visa Inc. V, Chevron Corp. CVX and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM.

Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:

5 S&P 500 Behemoths to Buy for Stellar Returns in August

Wall Street has entered August after an impressive bull run in July. The July rally snapped six months of rigorous market meltdown. The investor community is divided about whether the market has bottomed out or it witnessed a bear market relief rally. Therefore, the market’s movement in August will be an important indicator.

The broad-market S&P 500 Index advanced 9.1% in last month. Despite the fact that the benchmark is still in correction territory, having declined 13.6% year to date, it may gather pace in the second half of 2022.

At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in the U.S. corporate behemoths from the S&P 500 stable. We have selected five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These are - Tesla Inc., NextEra Energy Inc., Visa Inc., Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp..

Wall Street May Gain Some Pace in 2H 2022

A high dose of interest rate therapy and extremely tight monetary control by the Fed to combat the  record-high inflation might show positive signals. The U.S. economy fell by 0.9% in second-quarter 2022 after declining 1.6% in the first quarter. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that both consumer and business spending dropped owing to mounting pieces for goods and services.

Recently released major economic data such as ISM manufacturing and services indexes, retail sales and industrial production dropped significantly. The housing market — one of the booming sectors during the pandemic — has been declining precipitously since April.

Story continues

On Jul 27, the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank may reduce the magnitude of rate hikes going forward depending on economic data. However, both Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that despite two consecutive quarters of U.S. GDP contraction, the economy is not in recession as major macro-economic variables do not indicate so.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants (market capital >$100 billion) as these companies have a robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.

These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Tesla has acquired a substantial market share within the electric car segment. Increasing Model 3 delivery, which forms a significant chunk of TSLA’s overall deliveries, is aiding its top line. Along with Model 3, Model Y is contributing to its revenues. The global auto industry is gradually moving toward electric vehicles. Tesla is expected to be the largest beneficiary of this trend.

Despite the chip crisis, Tesla reported strong deliveries of 254,695 units in second-quarter 2022, 27% year over year. Additionally, TSLA’s energy generation and storage revenues are growing, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products.

TSLA has an expected earnings growth rate of 75.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.8% over the last 7 days.

Chevron is one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve a sustainable production ramp-up. CVX’s existing project pipeline is one of the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. The WTI crude oil price is hovering around $100 per barrel. The price is likely to remain elevated as the Russia-Ukraine conflict is yet to be resolved.

Chevron’s Noble Energy takeover has expanded its footprint in the region and the DJ Basin. CVX now has access to Noble Energy’s low-cost, proven reserves along with cash-generating offshore assets in Israel — particularly the flagship Leviathan natural gas project — thereby boosting its footing in the Mediterranean.

CVX has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 3.9% over the last 30 days.

Exxon Mobil made multiple world-class oil discoveries at the Stabroek Block, located off the coast of Guyana. XOM raised the estimate for discovered recoverable resources from the Stabroek Block to approximately 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels. The WTI crude oil price is hovering around $100 per barrel. The price is likely to remain elevated as the Russia-Ukraine clash continues.

Exxon Mobil’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil behemoth expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business. By then, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%.

Exxon Mobil has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 16.8% over the last 30 days.

NextEra Energy is expanding domestic clean energy assets through acquisitions and organic initiatives. NEE has stakes in natural gas pipelines in Texas and gains from an increase in natural gas production.

To enhance flexibility, NextEra Energy completed a few financing agreements to secure funds for acquisition. NEE benefits from declining installation costs and improving renewable technology. It has sufficient liquidity to meet obligations.

NextEra Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 12.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 7 days.

Visa has undertaken mergers and acquisitions, partnerships, and minority investments to achieve growth. V’s investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.

The coronavirus vaccine rollouts and the gradual revival of consumer confidence should keep driving spending, expanding business volumes in turn. Backed by its strong cash position, Visa remains committed to boosting its shareholder value. V’s balance sheet strength is commendable.

Visa has an expected earnings growth rate of 24.4% for the current year (ending September 2022). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.5% over the last 7 days.

Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021. Amazingly, they soared +40.3%, +48.2%, +67.6%, +94.4%, and +95.3%. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.

This Is How China Could Hit Back Over Pelosi’s Taiwan Visit Pelosi Poised to Land in Taiwan as China Rips ‘Provocative’ Trip World’s Most-Tracked Plane Is Jet That May Be Flying Pelosi They Quit Goldman’s Star Trading Team, Then the Bank Raised Alarms

Tesla hosts its annual meeting — nay, Cyber Roundup — on Thursday from its new plant in Austin, Texas, where the biggest item on the agenda is a likely shoo-in proposal clearing the way for a 3-for-1 stock split.

Elon Musk is of course famously not one for formality, so there’s bound to be more than the perfunctory discussion of management and shareholder measures and sharing of vote results. The chief executive officer uses these meetings to woo and whip up the retail investors he and the company have cultivated for years. Some die-hards who’ve stuck with the stock through dramatic ups and downs are now Teslanaires.

While Musk’s Q&A may well steal the show, there are lots of proposals worth breaking down beforehand. Here’s a guide of what to watch for during this year’s meeting, which is scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m. New York time:

More Shares to Split

Tesla’s stock surged in late March when the company announced plans to seek investors’ authorization for the company to have more shares outstanding, which would facilitate its second stock split in two years. Bloomberg Opinion columnist Matt Levine explained why the company is taking these steps here and here.

From the acquisition of SolarCity to the unprecedented pay package for Musk, shareholders have followed Tesla’s lead through many controversies. This isn’t another one. The stock soared when the company did a 10-for-1 split in August 2020, so why not try this again?

Directors Staying and Going

This year’s meeting will mark the end of a short directorship for Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle and friend of Musk who joined Tesla’s board in the wake of the settlement the company and its CEO reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late 2018.

Story continues

Ellison won’t be replaced, so Tesla’s board will shrink to seven members. Two of them — venture capitalist Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, another director who joined after Musk’s “funding secured” ordeal — are up for re-election. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended shareholders vote against both, citing continued concern about the amount of borrowing against Tesla stock that Musk and other directors do, which could put investors at risk if they’re forced to meet a margin call.

Barbarians at the Gate?

Another reason ISS opposes Ehrenpreis and Wilson-Thompson has to do with the response to a proposal last year that each of Tesla’s directors be subject to election annually. While this received the support of 57% of votes cast, Tesla has proposed a half measure: to shorten director terms to two years, from three. ISS called this out as unusual, writing that companies typically declassify their boards when a proposal to do so draws majority support.

Tesla has pushed back against ISS’s criticism, arguing that it will be better able to defend itself from “opportunistic corporate raiders” and “special interests that seek only short-term returns” if its directors only face a vote every two years.

Diversity and Disclosure

Another measure shareholders backed last year called for Tesla to produce an annual report on diversity and inclusion efforts. The company provided detailed data on the racial composition of its US workforce in May, selecting a handful of companies to argue its racial representation compares favorably to others in the tech and automotive industries.

This year, shareholders are after more disclosure and diversity efforts:

Proposal 7 calls for Tesla to prepare an annual report on how much money it’s spent on lawsuits and disputes related to abuse, harassment and discrimination, amid state and federal investigations into allegations that racism runs rampant within its workplace. Proposal 8 requests that Tesla report efforts to enhance diversity among its directors. With Ellison’s departure, its board comprises five men, one of whom is Asian, and two women, one of whom is Black. Proposal 9 urges Tesla for the third year in a row to publicly report on its use of mandatory arbitration and how it’s affecting the company’s brand, employees and workplace culture.

The ESG Debate

In the month leading up to this year’s meeting, Musk has loudly criticized environmental, social and governance investing, especially after Tesla lost its spot on the ESG version of the S&P 500 Index.

Proposal 10, which requests that Tesla issue a report on how its lobbying aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming, may invite another swing at ESG from Musk. The company argues this would be a waste of time — its very mission is to speed up the world’s shift to sustainable energy.

But while Tesla’s electric vehicles, solar roofs and battery products make the company an unquestioned leader with respect to the E- in ESG, two measures up for a vote this year speak to some of its social vulnerabilities.

Proposal 12 requests that Tesla report on its progress toward trying to make its batteries cobalt-free in order to eradicate use of child labor in the battery supply chain. The board opposes this and lays out its procurement strategy and supply chain diligence in the company’s proxy statement. Proposal 13 asks that Tesla assess and report how exposed it is to water supply risks, and calls for the company to be more transparent about water use at its facilities, a particularly hot-button issue for the company in Germany.

Collective Bargaining

Finally, a Canadian nonprofit is urging Tesla to adopt a collective-bargaining policy.

The US prohibits anti-union threats or retaliation while allowing companies to campaign aggressively against unionization. Musk has been a vocal critic of the United Auto Workers, and the National Labor Relations Board ruled last year that he and the company repeatedly violated US labor law by firing a union activist, interrogating pro-union employees and threatening staff against organizing.

This has been a source of tension between Musk and the Biden administration, although there are signs this may be blowing over. The White House recently highlighted Tesla’s investments in the US, while Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg credited the company for its EV leadership.

74,"Tesla Investors Boost Stock for Sixth Day, Unfazed by US-China Tensions","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. investors are unfazed by the brewing geopolitical tensions between US and China around Taiwan, as the stock is up for a sixth straight session ahead of the company’s annual meeting on Thursday.

This Is How China Could Hit Back Over Pelosi’s Taiwan Visit Pelosi Poised to Land in Taiwan as China Rips ‘Provocative’ Trip China Warns Airlines to Avoid ‘Danger Zones’ Around Taiwan

The electric-vehicle maker’s stock jumped as much as 3% to $928.65 in New York on Wednesday before paring much of that gain. After surging 17% in less than a week the shares are now up more than 45% from the May 24 closing low of $628.16. Better-than-expected second-quarter results and a climate change bill from the Biden administration are helping fuel the enthusiasm for the stock.

Still, any exuberance may prove short lived as supply chains have yet to normalize, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s lawsuit with Twitter Inc. continues to be an overhang, and the company’s reliance on China remains an issue with Taiwan in focus.

“If the superpowers continue to drift apart, then Tesla’s brand will be damaged in China, impacting sales,” Gene Munster, a former technology analyst who’s now a managing partner at venture-capital firm Loup Ventures, said during a live-blog interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday. “Given production of about 25% of Teslas comes from China, the China government has ways to make it more difficult for Tesla -- like shut downs for Covid or power conservation.”

Tesla will hold its annual general meeting on Thursday, where its investors will get to vote on a 3-for-1 stock-split plan. If approved, it will be Tesla’s second share-split in less than two years.

Stock splits seem to have lost some of their charm this year, but Tesla’s strong retail fan base means it may reap more benefit from the move than some other companies. According to Vanda Research data, retail purchases of Tesla shares are “skyrocketing,” with individual investors seen as most bullish on the company since the summer of 2020.

“Although a stock split shouldn’t have an impact on the stock price, retail investors speculate on the fact that historically stocks rallied after the split announcement,” Vanda’s Marco Iachini and Giacomo Pierantoni wrote in a note to clients. If a split is approved, the shares could go even higher, they added.

79,Analyst: Tesla stock is far overvalued and could plunge more than 50%,"Tesla stock is inflated and could lose more than half of its value, according to Citi analyst Itay Michaeli.

In a note to clients, Michaeli reiterated a sell rating on Tesla's stock on with a $424 price target. Tesla stock traded around at $923 per share on Wednesday.

The basis for Michaeli's bold call involves skepticism related to Tesla’s autonomous driving technology and the view that Tesla's stock — which is trading on a lofty forward P/E ratio of 76 times — is not factoring in a deepening economic slowdown.

""We think the current valuation remains challenging considering that the handful of other companies that previously achieved Tesla’s current market cap did so generating ~$100 billion of gross profit (on average) vs. Tesla’s second half 2022 estimated annualized of ~$30 billion (and $20 billion in the first half,"" Michaeli wrote. ""And, in the current macro situation, we need to be mindful that Tesla is adding sizable Model Y capacity in what are now price-points (>$60k US) where the US market-size is inherently smaller and where other EVs are also ramping.""

Michaeli joined JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman in reiterating a sell equivalent rating on Tesla's stock post second quarter earnings.

Tesla, meanwhile, has made a strong argument to justify the current valuation on its stock — and maybe even a richer one.

Second quarter sales rose 43% from a year ago to $14.6 billion. Operating profits surged 88% from a year ago to $2.5 billion.

""In a nutshell, the [second] quarter was better than feared with healthy guidance for 2H by Musk & Co. that look achievable with no margin for error,"" Webush Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a note. Elon Musk arrives at the In America: An Anthology of Fashion themed Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York, U.S., May 2, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly

The company could also see an earnings tailwind later this year from cooling commodities prices if CEO Elon Musk's prediction comes true.

""If I were to guess — and I would take this with a grain of salt — I think inflation will decline towards the end of this year,"" Musk told analysts on an earnings call. ""We are certainly seeing prices of commodities trending lower.""

82,Twitter subpoenas Binance and a dozen more firms over $44B Musk deal,"Bankers and advisers that backed Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s $44 billion bid for Twitter (TWTR) have been hit with a flood of new subpoenas from the social media site's lawyers. Those lawyers want to know what happened in Musk’s private negotiations leading up to the now-disputed deal.

On Tuesday, Twitter filed more than a dozen subpoenas in its fast-tracked lawsuit to force Musk to go through with the deal. The filings directed to Musk’s advisers and would-be lenders — including Binance, Factorial Funds, Benefit Street, Bandera Partners, Founders Fund Growth II Management — add to several others issued to Musk’s bankers, investors, and associates on Monday. Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX were also served with similar demands.

Notably, the subpoenas demand that Musk’s advisers and backers hand over documents and communications that either support or refute Musk’s suggestion that Twitter has under-reported the number of fake or “spam” accounts on the social media site.

Musk contends he's backing out of the deal because Twitter isn't providing him with data regarding the number of fake accounts, known as bots, that operate on its platform — and in some cases, spread disinformation. According to Musk, Twitter’s public representations about bot prevalence are misleading, and in excess of its estimated less than 5% of mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users.

Twitter, on the other hand, says it has long represented that its estimate could be wrong, and that Musk’s bot issue is a pretext for backing out of the agreement. Twitter adds that Musk also deliberately tried to tank the deal with a series of disparaging tweets.

In separate subpoenas directed to Binance and others, Twitter asks the companies to turn over any documents and communications related to Musk’s May 15 Tweet alleging “some chance” that Twitter’s percentage of bots and/or false or spam accounts “might be over 90% of daily active users.” Twitter post from accounts of @elonmusk and @BLKMDL3 on May 15, 2022

The request goes on to demand any documents concerning another Musk Tweet on May 17 that reads “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher.”

Story continues Twitter post from account of @elonmusk on May 17, 2022

The subpoenas further seek from the companies “drafts or iterations of any plans” relating to Twitter’s false or spam accounts, along with any media communications concerning spam accounts, and documents addressing Twitter’s SEC disclosures about spam.

While Twitter’s lawyers maintain that, under the merger agreement, the company didn't have to hand over the bot data he requested, his lawyers wrote in a July 8 letter to terminate the deal that Musk needed the fake account information for his financing.

The bot information, Musk’s lawyers wrote, is needed to “facilitate Musk’s financing and financial planning for the transaction, and to engage in transition planning for the business…”

For Musk’s part, his lawyers also issued subpoenas seeking information related to Twitter’s end of the transaction. His lawyers issued subpoenas to Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, as well as boutique investment bank Allen & Co.

Twitter’s subpoena requests on Monday sought documents and communications from Musk’s associates and investors, including Silicon Valley investors Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sacks, Joe Lonsdale, Steve Jurvetson, Marc Andreessen, Jason Calacanis, Keith Rabois; and from financial advisors Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.

A Delaware Chancery Court judge granted Twitter a five-day trial in the case, which is slated to begin Oct. 17.

87,The Best Stocks to Strike It Rich in ‘The Great EV Consolidation’,"A new revolution is brewing in the automotive market. And the types of EV stocks you buy will depend entirely on a brand-new, underrated megatrend in the electric car industry: The Great EV Consolidation.

In short, the number of electric vehicle companies will dramatically shrink over the next few years, not unlike that of the gas-powered car boom in the early 1900s. Back then, nearly 500 companies entered the race to capitalize on this technological marvel. But by 1930, less than 50 of them were still in operation. Cherry on the top: Just three automakers made up 80% of the market.

It’s a natural evolution. And the same thing is happening with EVs today.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

That means that there are both fantastic long-terminvestments and short-termtrades to play the Great EV Consolidation. But that’s only if you pick the right stocks.

To prove my point, electric trucking company Nikola (NKLA) just agreed to acquire battery maker Romeo Power (RMO)! We’ve said before that the EV industry is too crowded, and we’re due for a “great consolidation.” Nikola’s buyout of Romeo is just the beginning.

When a new technological paradigm emerges, everybody wants to start a business around it because they see an immense opportunity to strike itrich. But the market isn’t big enough to sustain all those startups. As an industry matures, it consolidates around a few players. Companies left out in the cold either go bankrupt or get acquired.

Guess what? The EV market is maturing. Every time I leave the house, I see a Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 or Model S. I often find myself in a “Tesla sandwich,” flanked by Tesla EVs on the highway.

Indeed, June 2022 saw a record-high number of EV auto sales. The industry has started to become meaningful to the global economy. And I believe that over the next 12 to 36 months, two things will define the EV industry – rapid growth and rapid consolidation.

Story continues

The top players that arise out of the EV boom will differentiate themselves from the pack in terms of some major value-add. (Think cost, design, performance, or branding). Those electric car titans will attract all the consumer demand and reap all the rewards of the EV Revolution. And they’ll squeeze out 90% of the industry.

So, when I look at the EV landscape today, I see a graveyard with a few shining stars.

To make some short-term gains, look for small-cap EV stocks that could be great acquisition targets. And make sure they are not at risk of bankruptcy.

These companies will have an edge over their competitors, plus unrivaled talent and technology.

Investors who buy high-quality small-cap EV stocks that are primed to be bought out by future titans of industry will see tremendous gains over the coming few years.

88,U.S. Congress office sees few tax breaks for EVs under Democratic plan,"By David Shepardson and Joseph White

Aug 3 (Reuters) - A proposal by U.S. Senate Democrats to put income, price and domestic content conditions on electric vehicle tax breaks could initially sharply curtail the number of EVs that qualify, the Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday.

The CBO estimate said the electric vehicle tax credits in a $430 billion climate and energy bill would cost taxpayers only $85 million in 2023, the equivalent of about 11,000 vehicles if all received $7,500 credits.

Automakers and their home states including Michigan are lobbying Senator Joe Manchin to revise proposals that would curtail or eliminate tax subsidies for electric trucks that cost more than $80,000, make households that earn more than $300,000 a year ineligible and tie tax breaks to ambitious and escalating levels of North American battery mineral production and manufacturing.

The proposed domestic content rules are aimed at pushing the EV industry away from reliance on China, and spur North American and U.S. battery mineral and manufacturing investments. The income limits address concerns that current law is a subsidy for the wealthy.

Privately, automaker executives said the measure could hinder EV sales in the short-term. They said they could quickly lose access to tens of thousands of credits that an existing law makes available with few restrictions on the first 200,000 vehicles sold before it phases out. They said this would hit automakers in the bottom line.

So far, Manchin has refused to reconsider his proposals.

""I don't believe that we should be building a transportation mode on the backs of foreign supply chains,."" Manchin said on Tuesday.

The subsidy rules, buried in details of the Senate Democrats' climate and energy plan agreed by Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, complicate what had been a straigthforward tax credit available to buyers most of EVs -- though both General Motors and Tesla previously hit the existing 200,000-vehicle tax break cap and are no longer eligible.

Story continues

Industry officials said it will be nearly impossible to achieve the domestic content rules calling for 50% of battery components to be manufactured in North America before 2024 and 60% by 2024-2025.

For 2022 to 2026, the CBO estimates the government would spend $1.78 billion on subsidies for new EV purchases - suggesting budget scorekeepers expect a total of just 237,000 EVs will qualify in those five years.

GM alone has said it expects to sell 400,000 EVs by the end of 2023. U.S. EV market leader Tesla, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Hyundai, Kia and Mercedes-Benz among others have plans to sell EVs in high volume as well.

Auto dealers are worried they ""will be left trying to explain to consumers why these incentives aren't available to them,"" Cody Lusk, president of the American International Automobile Dealers Association said Wednesday.

The Manchin-Schumer proposal would also create a new $4,000 tax credit for used EVs. The CBO estimates that would cost the government $1.35 billion over 10 years. It would translate to tax breaks for buyers of about 337,500 used EVs over that time.

Democrats are divided over the proposals, even as Republican lawmakers are closing ranks in opposition.

Senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, said Wednesday the domestic content goals ""are aggressive. But we need to be aggressive … about building out that domestic clean energy capacity here in the United States."" Smith said automakers ""should not expect or anticipate that we’re going to reopen this bill in any significant way to make changes to it.""

Michigan Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow said she is still pushing to change the proposals.

""It's a very cumbersome, unworkable credit once the full restrictions set in,"" Stabenow told Reuters. ""There's conversations going on."" (Reporting by David Shepardson, Joseph White and Nichola Groom; Editing by David Gregorio)",2022-08-03T22:57:04+00:00,2022-08-03

Some of the offensive videos cited by Freethinker included pythons attacking puppies. However, the judge noted the group only listed claims involving violations of state and local laws, like the breach of contract and false advertising. “Section 230 clearly states that ‘no cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any state or local law that is inconsistent with this section,’” the judge wrote. Previously Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk-led neurotechnology startup Neuralink refuted animal cruelty claims. The U.S. Department of Agriculture alleged cruel treatment of macaque monkeys who were being used to test Neuralink’s technology.

103,Tesla Set to Shed Junk-Bond Stigma as Wall Street’s Doubts Fade,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc., whose status as a stock-market darling has turned it into the world’s most valuable car company, may soon win over some of Wall Street’s slowest moving skeptics: Bond-rating analysts.

Investors had been expecting Tesla to be upgraded out of junk status as soon as early next year, marking a credit-market milestone for a company that’s risen to dominate the electric-vehicle industry in less than two decades.

But such a boost may come sooner, thanks to the company’s steady stream of profits, according to Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst Joel Levington. Tesla had nearly $19 billion in cash and short-term investments by the end of June, and Levington expects it to generate over $24 billion of additional free cash flow through next year. That would be more than General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. combined and far more than Tesla’s debt load.

“Tesla is still generating a huge amount of cash,” said Levington. “At some point ratings companies will have to act and I wouldn’t be surprised to see an upgrade to investment-grade happen before year-end.”

The yawning gap between Tesla’s stock-market value and its bond rating reflects how slowly S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service are to upgrade relatively young companies such as Tesla, whose first cars were rolled out in 2008.

Since 2020, its stock has rallied and in October Tesla became the first junk-rated company to have a market value of more than $1 trillion. It’s currently the sixth most-valued company globally, worth far more than higher-rated competitors like Toyota Motor Co. and Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and has turned Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk into the world’s richest person.

Still, S&P and Moody’s have steadily ratcheted up Tesla’s grade. In October, S&P upgraded it to BB+, one step below investment grade. Moody’s followed in January, boosting Tesla two steps to the same rank, citing improving profitability and business-scale prospects.

Story continues

Nishit Madlani, the head of North American auto-sector ratings at S&P, in June said that Tesla is likely to be bumped out of junk status this year because of “solid execution” even in the face of supply-chain bottlenecks.

“An upgrade is likely this year,” Madlani said at the Autopalooza 5 virtual event organized by Bloomberg Intelligence on June 16.

Such a move is widely anticipated in credit markets. Tesla’s five-year credit-default swaps -- a type of insurance against a missed payment -- are already trading in line with investment-grade borrowers, according to ICE Data Services.

But an upgrade could provide a boost to Tesla’s shares since some mutual funds are prohibited from investing in junk-rated companies. That may be one reason why Tesla has a smaller percentage of its stock held by institutional investors than Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“Currently many funds cannot own an equity where the debt is rated below investment grade,” said Gary Black, managing partner at The Future Fund. He said an upgrade would give Tesla “blue-chip status.”

Tesla last month reported second-quarter profit that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations and is boosting its capital spending plan over the next two years to increase production.

S&P’s Madlani has said he wants more clarity on what the company’s profit margins will look like as it ramps up its manufacturing facilities and as commodity costs rise. The ratings provider is also weighing Tesla’s software-related business, among other factors.

“We tie all that down to, what does this mean for the company’s market position?” said Madlani.

For Moody’s, key considerations are whether Tesla can broaden its vehicle lineup and maintain its global competitive edge, according to Rene Lipsch, senior credit officer at the rating company. “There’s certainly no indication why they would not be able to do so,” he said at the Autopalooza event.

A sizeable chunk of borrowers in the high-yield market have been shedding their junk ratings this year. Such so-called rising stars have hit a record of $60.9 billion, Deutsche Bank AG credit strategist Karthik Nagalingam wrote in a July 29 note. While businesses are contending with rising rates and mounting signs of an economic slowdown, Deutsche Bank estimates there is still $95 billion of bonds that could move out of junk this year and into the early part of 2023 as long as earnings for some issuers don’t crater.

Tesla could be one of them.

The Chips and Science Act will provide grants and subsidies worth $280 billion to the US technology and semiconductor industry. The National Science Foundation will be provided funding of $81 billion so it can focus more on technology and boost growth and innovation in the country. The bill will allocate $52 billion to amp up the domestic chip making industry, so that the United States is not reliant on Asia for semiconductor chips and related devices. Although the US has leading chip designers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), it lacks domestic chip manufacturers and is largely reliant on China, Taiwan, and South Korea.

The political tensions on rise between China and the US further caused dread in the semiconductor industry, which was facing severe supply constraints already as a result of pandemic-related lockdowns in China. Consequently, several sectors including automobiles, communications, and defense suffered. The US military requires approximately 1.9 billion chips annually for weapons and communications. Similarly, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced that in light of the global chip shortage, it would not roll out new models in 2022.

Due to the mounting tensions between Washington and Beijing, the US government has required companies who receive subsidies from the CHIPS Act to not simultaneously increase their production of advanced chips in China or Russia. The White House supports this measure.

Our Methodology

We selected semiconductor firms that are positioned to benefit from the subsidies from the CHIPS Act. This includes semiconductor manufacturing, equipment, and design firms that will utilize the grant money to expand their operations in the United States. We have mentioned the latest analyst ratings and the hedge fund sentiment around the securities as of the first quarter of 2022.

Stocks That Will Benefit from CHIPS Act

10. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24

GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) was founded in 2009 and is based in Malta, New York. It is a semiconductor foundry that manufactures integrated circuits, microprocessors, mobile application processors, radio frequency modems, microcontrollers, power management units, and microelectromechanical systems. The company also offers wafer fabrication services and technologies.

GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) is increasing its manufacturing capacity in the United States, Singapore, and Germany, which will enable the firm to raise its output by 60% by 2024, compared to its 2020 levels. GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the CHIPS Act, and the company stressed that the government subsidy is essential to give the US semiconductor companies a chance to compete globally and overcome supply bottlenecks.

On July 20, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore reaffirmed a Buy recommendation on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) but lowered the price target on the shares to $55 from $70. The current ""purgatory"" stage of the semiconductor cycle prevails heading into the Q2 earnings season, the analyst told investors. Despite predicting positive activity across most of the semiconductor sector in Q2 and Q3, the analyst said investors seem to be awaiting a ""widespread deck-clearing"" guide-down before jumping back into semi stocks. He is now ""more actively factoring in accelerating macro/sector headwinds"" into his 2023 estimates, and slashing revenue, earnings, and price targets by an average of 4%, 10%, and 14%, respectively.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 24 hedge funds were bullish on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) at the end of Q1 2022, with collective stakes worth $791.2 million, compared to 23 the prior quarter worth $426.2 million. David Goel and Paul Ferri’s Matrix Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 9.17 million shares valued at about $573 million.

Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) is making headlines as the US domestic semiconductor industry has come into focus with the approval of the CHIPS Act.

9. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46

Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) designs and manufactures semiconductors for electronics designers and manufacturers worldwide. The company operates through two segments – Analog and Embedded Processing. On July 27, the company reported Q2 GAAP earnings per share of $2.45, beating market estimates by $0.33. The revenue climbed 13.8% year over year to $5.81 billion, outperforming Street consensus by $560 million. According to its Q3 guidance, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) expects revenue in the range of $4.90 billion to $5.30 billion, versus a $4.65 billion consensus. The company forecasts earnings per share ranging from $2.23 to $2.51, compared to $2.15 per share earnings consensus.

Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) announced in November 2021 that it selected Sherman, Texas as a site to open about four plants worth up to $30 billion. The company started construction in Sherman this May and already got substantial tax cuts from local governments for the project. The CHIPS Act is “gravy on top” for Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), according to CEO Rich Templeton.

On July 27, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore raised the price target on Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) to $165 from $160 and kept a Hold rating on the shares after the Q2 results. The analyst still views Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) as one of the top quality firms in the semiconductor space, but he believes the combination of higher macro/sector-specific demand and supply headwinds will keep the shares comparatively range bound.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 46 hedge funds were long Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) at the end of the first quarter of 2022, compared to 53 funds in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 3.3 million shares worth about $622 million.

Here is what Davis Opportunity Fund has to say about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:

“Within technology and communication services, we own a number of online businesses and semiconductor related companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Intel, Applied Materials and Texas Instruments. Within the realm of high technology, we believe that leadership positions reflect enduring and widening competitive advantages over smaller competitors, with few exceptions. This is because online businesses, as well as semiconductor companies, benefit from economies of scale. An online search and advertising engine will, in general, be more profitable per unit of cost as it grows larger in terms of users and advertising dollars. It is a hub-and-spoke model, in other words, where it is generally not necessary to grow expenses at the same rate that revenues grow beyond a certain threshold. Therefore, returns on capital tend to be higher, the larger and more dominant the online search company is.”

8. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59

Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) designs, manufactures, and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. As the government pours money into the semiconductor industry in the United States, demand for manufacturing and processing equipment will increase locally. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is thus one of the beneficiaries of the CHIPS Act.

On July 27, the company reported its FQ4 results, posting non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.83, exceeding Street estimates by $1.50. The revenue of $4.64 billion jumped 14% on a quarter over quarter basis, beating analysts’ predictions by $430 million. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) guided Q3 2022 above Street consensus, with a revenue of $4.9 billion and earnings per share of $9.50, compared to market estimates of $4.6 billion and $8.73, respectively.

Wells Fargo analyst Joe Quatrochi raised the price target on Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) to $475 from $460 and maintained an Equal Weight rating on the shares on July 28. While Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)’s better-than-anticipated Q4 results/Q1 guide reflect improving supply chain environment and execution, the analyst thinks investors will focus on increasing China export restrictions and WFE commentary.

Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 59 funds were bullish on Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) at the end of Q1 2022, compared to 62 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest shareholder of the company, with 1.90 million shares worth $1.02 billion.

Here is what Artisan Global Value Fund has to say about Lam Research Corporation (NYSE:LRCX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“Lam is one of the world’s largest suppliers of semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE). Manufacturing semiconductors is incredibly complex with tolerances measured in nanometers. Consistent improvements in technology are necessary for manufacturers to improve the cost, functionality and volume of semiconductors. WFE manufacturers such as Lam provide the necessary machines and technology. The WFE industry is highly consolidated with only five global players holding more than two thirds of the market. Because of the value-added nature of the equipment and services, the industry is highly profitable with margins and returns on capital that most CEOs can only dream of.”

7. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a California-based global supplier of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s Q2 2022 EPS of $9.07 and revenue of $8.1 billion topped market consensus estimates by $0.35 and $190 million, respectively. The company guided a Q3 revenue of approximately $8.4 billion, compared to a consensus of $7.97 billion. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also authorized a new share repurchase program to buy back up to $10 billion of common stock through December 31, 2023. As the semiconductor industry gets a financial boost through the CHIPS Act, demand for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s product offerings will increase.

On July 20, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore maintained a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) and lowered the price target on the stock to $635 from $700. The analyst is now ""more actively factoring in accelerating macro/sector headwinds"" into his 2023 estimates, and slashing his revenue, earnings, and price targets on average by 4%, 10%, and 14% accordingly.

According to Insider Monkey’s database, 71 hedge funds were bullish on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) at the end of March 2022, up from 62 funds in the earlier quarter. William Von Mueffling’s Cantillon Capital Management featured as a prominent stakeholder of the company, with more than 1 million shares worth $652.18 million.

Here is what ClearBridge Investments Sustainability Leaders Strategy has to say about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:

“However, ClearBridge portfolio companies are responding by supporting their workforces and showing resilience in adapting and thriving. Semiconductor companies ClearBridge owns and engages with have been successful in advancing vaccinations in their global supply chains. In Malaysia, for example, Broadcom has taken part in PIKAS, a public-private partnership vaccination program focusing on the workforce in critical manufacturing sectors. By the summer of 2021 Broadcom was able to get over 90% of workers in its Penang factory at least one dose of vaccine, and roughly 73% fully vaccinated. Companies in the program also pay the administration cost for vaccinations including cases where the employee is no longer employed by the company before full immunization of the employee.”

6. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74

Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) was incorporated in 1967 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company provides manufacturing equipment, services, and software to the semiconductor industry. As the CHIPS Act increases semiconductor production within the United States, demand for Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)’s equipment and software will rise as a result. Despite missing Q2 consensus estimates for earnings per share and revenue, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) generated $415 million in cash from operations and returned $2.01 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends worth  $1.80 billion and $211 million, respectively.

On July 25, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore reaffirmed an Equal Weight rating on Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and lowered the firm's price target on the stock to $115 from $133. He slashed his calendar year 2023 wafer fabrication equipment estimate to about $83 billion from $90 billion, though he argued that there is ""a fair amount of guesswork in a 2023 WFE estimate at this point"", with demand for equipment dampening, but not enough to put an end to supply constraints in the short-term. He remains optimistic on semi equipment over devices and sees 2023 as a trough, regardless of upcoming headwinds, the analyst added.

Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management held the leading position in Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in Q1 2022, consisting of 4.25 million shares worth $561 million. Overall, 74 hedge funds were bullish on Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) at the end of March 2022, compared to 78 funds a quarter earlier.

Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a notable American semiconductor stock to watch.

Here is what Davis Opportunity Fund has to say about Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:

“Within technology and communication services, we own a number of online businesses and semiconductor related companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Intel, Applied Materials and Texas Instruments. Within the realm of high technology, we believe that leadership positions reflect enduring and widening competitive advantages over smaller competitors, with few exceptions.

111,Electric Cars’ Surging Prices Mean Fewer Buyers Can Use Tax Credit,"(Bloomberg) -- Vehicle-price caps included in a push by US Senate Democrats to expand a popular consumer incentive for electric cars could put pressure on automakers to lower costs of upcoming plug-in models.

A breakthrough deal between Senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin would allow carmakers to keep offering up to $7,500 in tax credits for the purchase of new “clean cars.” The problem comes with Congress’s plan to restrict eligibility for the credits to EVs priced no higher $55,000 for new cars and $80,000 for pickups and SUVs -- one way to ensure the benefit goes to consumers who need them most, instead of the wealthiest.

Limits that may have seemed more reasonable a year ago look tight now that inflation and supply-chain disruptions have already pushed average EV prices beyond the range. To get the maximum benefit, automakers are going to have to expedite plans to build cheaper models, industry watchers say.

“EVs thus far have been purchased by the most affluent consumers and mostly expensive models,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, which conducts market research for dealers. “To proliferate EVs, they need to cost less and be accessible to more consumers, either by price and/or incentives. In the future, automakers are promising less expensive EVs.”

The average transaction price of a new electric car was $66,997 in June, soaring almost 14% from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book. The industrywide average that includes both traditional vehicles and EVs jumped 13%, to $48,043, in the same period.

Options Add Cost

Base models of the two most popular EVs in the US market would easily meet the eligibility limits set for the tax credits. Tesla Inc.’s Model Y SUV, which is currently the top-selling EV in the US, starts at $65,990. The best-selling electric sedan, Tesla’s Model 3, starts at $46,990. But many buyers prefer souped-up versions, prices of which could exceed the proposed limits.

Vehicle price isn’t the only limitation on the tax credits. Under the proposed legislation, a new-vehicle buyer’s eligibility would be capped at income levels of $150,000 for a single filing taxpayer and $300,000 for joint filers. For used-car purchases, the income caps would be $75,000 and $150,000 depending on filing status.

The incentive also is contingent on new conditions that carmakers say will be hard for them to comply with right away: eligible EVs will need to be built with minerals that are extracted or processed in a country with which the US has a free trade agreement. and their batteries must include a large percentage of parts manufactured or assembled in North America.

Some automakers who manufacture higher-end EVs, such as electric car maker Rivian Automotive LLC, are lobbying to extend the transition time before new limits on vehicle price and income for buyers take effect.

“As currently drafted, this legislation will pull the rug out from consumers considering purchase of an American-made electric vehicle,” Rivian said in a statement. The automaker markets an electric pickup and electric SUV with respective starting prices of $67,500 and $72,500 -- meaning both could easily cross the limit once options are added.

Limits ‘Reasonable’

John Bozzella, chief executive officer of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said the Senate’s proposed price caps “are reasonable” and that carmakers are working to introduce more affordable EVs now that battery technology is improving. The battery and mineral requirements, however, should be phased in, he said.

“We see significant entries coming at every price point that will provide an opportunity for Americans at every income level” to experience EVs, said Bozzella, whose alliance represents companies such as Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Stellantis NV, Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. “Average transaction prices are high right now, but that’s partly due to supply chain issues.”

Price has been the No. 1 obstacle to EV adoption cited by consumers in Cox Automotive’s research, Krebs said. “It had risen more as an obstacle since our study a couple years earlier.”

114,S&amp;P 500 Struggles for Direction Ahead of Jobs Report,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 flirted between gains and losses Thursday, as investors digested data pointing to a slowdown in the labor market just a day ahead of a crucial monthly jobs report that will offer clues on the health of the economy.

The S&P 500 fell 0.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.3%, or 87 points, and the Nasdaq was up 0.21%.

The Department of Labor reported Thursday that 260,000 people filed for unemployment insurance in the week ended July 30, up 6,000 from the prior week, but in line with economists’ forecasts.

The data come ahead of Friday’s jobs report that will offer clues on the health of the economy following recent data showing the U.S. economy declined for a second-straight quarter. 

Economists expect that the economy generated about 250,000 jobs in July, compared with 372,000 jobs the prior month.

The jobs report will also serve as a readthrough on the Federal Reserve’s likely path of action on monetary policy as the central bank has highlighted the strength of the labor market as evidence that the economy remains robust and is able to withstand further rate hikes.

Energy was the biggest drag on the broader market, down more than 2% as U.S. oil prices fell below $90 for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine.

 Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) were among the biggest decliners in the sector, with the latter down more than 8%.

Technology, however, cut losses keeping downside in the broader market in check as big tech traded mostly higher.

Elsewhere in tech, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) gained more than 5% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results despite the lockdowns in China holding back growth.

Consumer discretionary stocks were supported by a jump in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as investors look ahead to the latter’s shareholder meeting today. At the meeting, shareholders are expected to back the electric vehicle maker’s 3-for-1 stock split.

MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), meanwhile, jumped more than 3% after reporting quarterly earnings that missed estimates, but revenue topped expectations after more than doubling in the second quarter.

Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), however, fell 2% after reporting mixed quarterly results as earnings beat, but revenue fell short of expectations, sending its share more than 2% lower.

Homebuilders were also in the ascendency, lifting consumer stocks, after data showing mortgage rates fell below 5% to their lowest level since April as investors price in a less hawkish Federal Reserve.

DR Horton (NYSE:DHI), Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM) were up more than 3%.

In other news, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) jumped more than 17% after the cryptocurrency exchange inked a partnership with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to allow the latter’s institutional clients to invest in bitcoin.

On Wednesday, chief executive Peter Rawlinson shocked investors with weak quarterly figures and a surprise cut to the vehicle production forecast in the face of severe problems at its Casa Grande factory near Phoenix.

Rawlinson, former chief engineer of the Tesla Model S, placed blame primarily on the growing pains associated with ramping up production, where parts need to arrive just in time and in the right cadence depending on an individual’s customized order.

“Our revised outlook guidance for the year reflects the logistics challenges as we began scaling, which exposed the immaturity of our logistics processes,” Rawlinson told investors during a call.

Shares in the company slumped more than 10% on Thursday, as Lucid has been considered one of the EV startups outside of China best positioned to survive the industry shake-up along with Amazon-backed Rivian.

That’s because the Lucid Air is arguably the most advanced car in terms of electrification currently on the market, easily beating anything Tesla has to offer.

Not only does it have the longest range at an EPA-rated 517 miles, but it is also the most efficient in terms of stored energy with 4.6 miles per kilowatt hour of battery. It also boasts the fastest recharge speeds thanks to a 900-volt electrical architecture, helping it win Motor Trend’s prestigious Car of the Year award in November.

Quality problems

Realizing investors would be rattled by the news, Rawlinson tried to assuage his shareholders that he was well on top of the situation.

“I do believe we’ve identified the primary bottlenecks and have already taken steps to begin to remedy the situation,” he said, after unveiling $97 million in quarterly revenue. This badly missed a consensus estimate of $145 million, and came amid a $220 million net loss that was even deeper red on an operating level.

Story continues

But the problems do not stop at the slow pace of production due to a mismatch of when parts arrive at its Casa Grande factory. They go much deeper.

Rawlinson conceded that a material number of vehicles built had not been shipped to customers due to quality he felt was subpar for a luxury model like the Air, and pledged to stay behind in Arizona, engaging directly with the staff on the shop floor to iron out the problems.

These related to mainly cosmetic issues like unusually large or uneven gaps in the body panels or surfaces not being flush with others.

While Tesla is famous for getting away with poor build quality, this type of “fit and finish,” as it is called in the industry, remains a hallmark of the German premium brands Mercedes-Benz and BMW and is expected by discriminating buyers who plunk down $100,000 on a new car.

As a result, Rawlinson said many new changes would be overseen by experienced logistics and quality assurance managers that he poached from industry rivals Mercedes and Stellantis.

“Quality simply must take priority over volume as we establish our brand reputation,” he explained.

Waning threat to Tesla

Lucid’s problems mimic the months of “production hell” at Tesla that saw Elon Musk famously sleeping at the factory, when Model 3 midsize sedans were being assembled out in the open air, an absolute no-go for the industry.

Only this time, instead of struggling with its first mass-market car built in the hundreds of thousands, Lucid is already experiencing problems with its premier model, a low-volume luxury sedan positioned at the very pinnacle of the market.

All told, only 679 Lucid Air cars were shipped to customers in the second quarter, prompting Rawlinson to predict just 6,000 to 7,000 would be made during the full year.

This amounts to just half of what it previously promised in May and a sharp decline from its original goal of 20,000 vehicles. That still means a sharp ramp-up in the second half, as so far only about 1,400 Lucid cars have been built.

For Tesla, the news is further welcome proof of its edge over key competitors. Lucid had been considered a threat by CEO Elon Musk, especially with an experienced Tesla engineer running the show.

Just days after Rawlinson debuted the technical specs of its series-production Air sedan in September 2020, Musk followed with the announcement of a Model S that would have a range of over 520 miles, at least three better than the competitor from Lucid.

Popular EV website Elektrek, long notable for its Tesla-friendly coverage, even ran a story about Musk’s newly “unveiled” model with the improved range, suggesting a proof of concept had been built and tested ahead of its 2021 launch. Fans speculated the considerable boost to range over the regular Plaid’s 348 miles must come from using the next-generation 4680 cells designed to cement Tesla’s technological lead.

In the end, the so-called Plaid Plus turned out to be nothing but vaporware, and Tesla is still working out the kinks with its 4680 cells.

Musk first accepted deposits from paying customers and then promptly cancelled on them, automatically switching their orders to the regular Plaid that he argued was just as good.

In the meantime, the tactic may have succeeded in keeping enough Model S owners from switching over to Lucid.

Saudi help

Why was Musk worried? It may have something to do with the bottomless pockets of Lucid’s backers, the Saudis.

As long as Rawlinson can keep the Kingdom convinced he will deliver a return on its investment, up to and including the construction of an assembly plant in the Arabian desert to fulfill a Saudi dream, then he can likely keep the company afloat while other rival startups like Lordstown Motors and Faraday Future flounder.

Lucid recently struck a deal to sell up to 100,000 cars to the Kingdom in addition to the 37,000 current reservations he already has on hand. This should help keep the company paying its bills until well into next year—even longer if management stretches the budget, as finance chief Sherry House claimed on Wednesday.

In the meantime, Rawlinson made a clear signal to another California company, Apple, and any other tech firms, by saying he may be in need of a partner and was open for business—perhaps to hedge his Saudi bet.

The Air and its Gravity SUV sibling due in 2024 are big enough to fit all the necessary sensors and computing power for a future autonomous robotaxi fleet.

“Many of these characteristics and attributes [of our vehicles] would potentially make us a fantastic partner for one of these groups,” he said, with CFO House noting that she was even ""keenly open to discussing partnership options.""

Amid the poor results, Rawlinson made a concerted effort not to further undermine investor confidence in management, suggesting the hiccups were a perfectly normal development that “became more apparent as we started to scale.”

Instead of dwelling on mistakes, he emphasized his pride at what Lucid’s workforce and suppliers could accomplish in the face of adversity and suggested the brand would be around for a long time to come thanks to an upcoming midsize model that will arrive later in the decade.

“But I want to be clear that right now, my relentless focus is with this great team right here in Arizona,” the Lucid CEO said. “I remain confident that we shall overcome these near-term challenges with a relentless tenacity and a steely determination, and in so doing put in place appropriate processes that will serve us well for the future.”

118,Elon Musk accuses Twitter of 'burying' his side of the fight over their $44B deal,"Elon Musk's lawyers are accusing Twitter (TWTR) of ""burying"" his side of the story in their dispute over the Tesla (TSLA) CEO's decision to renege on a $44 billion deal to buy the social media site.

In dueling letters filed in Delaware Chancery Court on Wednesday, Twitter argued that court rules require Musk’s countersuit, now filed under seal, to be blocked from public view for five business days. Meanwhile, Musk accused Twitter of misapplying the rule to conceal his version of events.

“Twitter should not be permitted to continue burying the side of the story it does not want publicly disclosed,” Musk’s attorney, Edward B. Micheletti, wrote in a letter to Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick.

According to Micheletti, Twitter’s lawyers incorrectly interpreted Chancery Rule 5.1, which offers opposing parties time to make document redactions to confidential information. Micheletti said Musk is required to wait only three business days, rather than five.

The shorter timeframe, the lawyer argued, is grounded in “the public's right to know the background and allegations underlying civil actions brought before the courts of this State.”

OnJuly 12, Twitter filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court — the country’s preeminent business dispute forum — asking for one of its chancellors to compel Musk to buy the company, as he promised in his April 25 merger agreement. UKRAINE - 2022/04/26: In this photo illustration, Twitter account of Elon Musk is seen on a smartphone screen and Twitter logo in the background.

Musk’s countersuit was filed under seal on July 29, and Twitter says he must keep it under seal until Aug. 5. Twitter acknowledges the public has an interest in Musk's filing.

“Few cases attract as much public interest as this one, and Twitter is mindful of this Court’s commitment to ensuring maximum public access to its proceedings,” Twitter’s lawyer Kevin Shannon wrote its communication to McCormick.

Confidential information is a hot-button issue in the mega-merger meltdown.

In a matter of weeks from signing the contract to purchase Twitter’s outstanding stock at $44.20 per share, Musk hinted of cold feet and then terminated the deal. Officially, Musk cited Twitter’s supposed refusal to hand over data it says is confidential related to the number of fake accounts, or bots, on its platform. Twitter has reported in securities filings that fake accounts are estimated to make up less than 5% of its monetizable daily active users, but Musk says he suspects the real number is much higher.

Story continues

Twitter contends Musk is using the bot request as a pretext for backing out and that the agreement allows the company to both refuse Musk’s demands and force him to buy the company.

Musk's lawyers, for their part, say he can ditch the agreement entirely because Twitter's refusals qualify as a material breach — and possibly as a ""material adverse effect"" that would void the deal. In a July 8 termination letter, Musk's lawyers called the bot data ""fundamental to Twitter’s business and financial performance"" and necessary to complete the deal.

A hearing before Chancellor McCormick to consider the arguments in these letters is scheduled to take place on Friday. Last month McCormick granted Twitter’s request to set the case on an expedited schedule. A five-day trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 17.

120,Stock Market Today: Dow Wobbles Ahead of Monthly Jobs Report as Energy Loses Steam,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The Dow slipped Thursday, as a slump in energy stocks weighed on the broader market ahead of the eagerly awaited monthly jobs report due Friday that will offer fresh insight into the health of the economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.3%, or 85 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.41%, and the S&P 500 fell about 0.1%.

The Department of Labor reported Thursday that 260,000 people filed for unemployment insurance in the week ended July 30, up 6,000 from the prior week, but roughly in line with economists’ forecasts.

The data come ahead of Friday’s jobs report that will offer clues on the health of the economy following recent data showing the U.S. economy declined for a second-straight quarter. 

Economists expect that the economy generated about 250,000 jobs in July, compared with 372,000 jobs the prior month. But an upside surprise above 300,000 jobs would likely force markets to reassess expectations of a potential slowdown and likely weigh on stocks. 

The jobs report will also serve as a readthrough on the Federal Reserve’s likely path of action on monetary policy as the central bank has highlighted the strength of the labor market as evidence that the economy remains robust and is able to withstand further rate hikes. A much better-than-expected jobs report, with a headline number beyond 300,000 may prove bad news for stocks as it'll likely buoy the central bank to follow through on its plan to frontload rate hikes.

""A very strong headline number, north of 300,000 jobs, will be problematic for markets because it'll certainly give the Fed ammunition to [tighten monetary policy further],"" Chief Strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management Rhys Williams told Investing.com in an interview on Thursday. Average hourly wages will also be closely watched, Rhys added, saying that a surprise fall in wages would ""probably be pretty good for equities because it would show that this work is getting accomplished and they don't need to keep raising rates.""

Energy was the biggest drag on the broader market, down more than 2% as U.S. oil prices fell below $90 for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine.

 Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), and APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) were among the biggest decliners in the sector, with the latter down more than 10%.

Technology, however, cut losses keeping downside in the broader market in check as big tech traded mostly higher.

Elsewhere in tech, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) gained about 2% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results despite the lockdowns in China holding back growth.

Consumer discretionary stocks were supported by a jump in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as investors look ahead to the latter’s shareholder meeting today. At the meeting, shareholders are expected to back the electric vehicle maker’s 3-for-1 stock split.

MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), meanwhile, jumped more than 3% after reporting quarterly earnings that missed estimates, but revenue topped expectations after more than doubling in the second quarter.

Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), however, fell 1% after reporting mixed quarterly results as earnings beat, but revenue fell short of expectations, sending its share more than 2% lower.

Homebuilders were also in the ascendency, lifting consumer stocks, after data showing mortgage rates fell below 5% to their lowest level since April on expectations for a less hawkish Federal Reserve.

DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) and Lennar (NYSE:LEN) were up more than 3%, while PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM) climbed about 2%

In other news, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) jumped more than 10% after the cryptocurrency exchange inked a partnership with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to allow the latter’s institutional clients to invest in bitcoin.

124,7 Cheap Electric Vehicle Stocks to Buy Before They Boom,"Environment consciousness, governmental policy support, and improved charging infrastructure are among the factors that contributed to the strong uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years. More and more countries have suggested that they would phase out internal combustion engine, or ICE, vehicles sooner than later. This shift in market dynamics provides an opportunity for those looking to pick up some cheap electric vehicle stocks before they boom.

EV sales doubled in 2021 to a record 6.6 million units, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency. IEA estimates include both battery EVs and plug-in hybrids. This is a far cry from the mere 120,000 units sold in 2012. And the buoyancy continued into 2022, with EV sales touching 2 million units in the first quarter, up about 75% year-over-year.

EV adoption is only going to accelerate further in the coming years. This bodes well for the entrenched players, startups, and legacy automakers who are transitioning to EVs.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The EV industry faced a setback amid the supply crunch that upset their production plans and also escalated their costs. Left with no option, most preferred to pass through the input cost inflation to consumers. This pushed the already wary consumers on the backfoot.

As these headwinds end, it is likely that pent-up demand unlocks, proving healthy for the EV manufacturers.

Here are a few cheap electric vehicles stocks that you can pick up for bargains before they can really take off:

GOEV  Canoo $3.74 NIO Nio $20.30 WKHS Workhorse $4.06 SEV Sono Group $3.22 RIDE Lordstown $2.93 ARVL Arrival $1.8 F Ford $15.69

Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV) had a strong July, having started the month at $1.86 and ending at $3.46. Don’t jump to conclusions yet. The stock may not have turned the corner. It is still way off its 52-week high of $13.35 reached on Nov. 29, 2021.

Story continues

July’s advance was due to the twin deal the company struck during the month. Retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) agreed to buy 4,500 EVs from Canoo to facilitate last-mile delivery. Incidentally, Canoo said late last year that it is relocating to Bentonville, Arkansas, where Walmart is headquartered. The developer of the Lifestyle brand of EVs and delivery vans also won a U.S. Army contract to supply an EV for analysis and demonstration.

The two contracts came as a welcome relief to Canoo, which sounded out a going concern warning in mid-May. The company had then lamented about its grim cash position, although it expressed confidence that production would start in 2022.

An update on the cash position will come through in Canoo’s second-quarter earnings report, due on August 8. If Canoo can keep up the production timeline and also mobilize enough finances to keep its operations going, this cheap electric vehicle stock could head northward.

Nio (NYSE:NIO) stands out among the U.S.-listed Chinese EV trio in terms of its focused approach and mind share among customers. That said, Nio’s stock has underperformed both XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI).

Granted Nio’s fundamentals faltered a bit amid production disruptions specific to the company in late 2021. The company was later caught in the vortex of broader Covid lockdowns in China and had to leave its manufacturing plants shuttered for about three weeks in April 2022.

The disruption was all the worse because Nio was expected to be up and running in 2022, thanks to the planned launch of at least three new models. Sell-side was getting excited about the volume lift this is going to give. Covid resurgence in China poured cold water on Nio’s well-thought-out plans.

Nio said earlier this month that production of its ET7 sedan and EC6 SUV was constrained by supply-chain issues.

The Shanghai-based company may come up trumps when these issues alleviate. For Nio investors, a logical step could be to accumulate shares, which are currently trading at an attractive valuation.

Workhorse (NYSE:WKHS), a Cincinnati, Ohio-based manufacturer of last-mile delivery EVs, is pushing ahead with a focused approach. The company suffered a setback in early 2021 after it lost out to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) on a $6 billion contract from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).

The company also had to recall its C-1000 delivery van in September 2021, citing safety issues and it suspended deliveries of the model.

Ever since peaking in mid-May 2021, the stock has been on a broader downtrend. It gathered some momentum late last month when USPS suggested that it would buy more EVs than it had originally planned. In May, the company said fleet maintenance company Amerit Fleet Solutions has placed orders for 10 battery EVs. This comes on top of its 2021 maintenance services deal with Amerit.

Workhorse said it would return the C-1000 to the market, starting in August. It also plans to deliver the W750 delivery van and the W4CC cab chassis version later this year. Two more vehicles will drop in by the third quarter of 2023 and 2024.

But with the $167 million cash on hand, can the company fund its way through the development timelines of its products? If it can pull it off, the stock could take off in a big way.

The Sono Group (NASDAQ:SEV) is a Germany-based manufacturer of solar-powered EVs. Its first car in the works — the Sion, is supposed to be a mass market vehicle priced at around $26,000. The cost economics is kept favorable due to the company’s asset-light business model.

Recently, Sono Group unveiled the final production design of Sion, signaling an imminent start of production. The company plans to deliver the vehicle to customers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in the second half of 2023.

Funding could be an issue with the company, as is the case with any EV startup.

The company said in a presentation last month that Sion has raked up more than 19,000 reservations, translating to a potential sales value of about $400 million.

Apart from its car business, the company has other revenue avenues such as solar component sales, solar development sales and transaction share of sharing app.

Lordstown (NASDAQ:RIDE) can put its checkered past behind it, now that it has a viable business plan in place. The company completed an asset-purchase deal with Taiwan’s Foxconn (OTCMKTS:HNHPF) in mid-May that transfers the ownership of the former’s Ohio plant to the latter for about $230 million.

Foxconn has taken a stake in Lordstown, valued at $50 million, providing it with the much-needed financing. The two companies have also negotiated a supply agreement for the former’s Endurance EV pick-up truck, under which the Taiwanese company will take over the manufacturing. The companies expect to start the production of the Endurance truck in the third quarter and begin deliveries by the fourth quarter.

Lordstown and Foxconn have also announced a joint venture agreement to co-develop EVs using the latter’s open-source EV platform.

So, it’s like Lordstown has received a fresh lease of life. The company could not have gotten a better partner than Foxconn, which has years of production experience with Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones.

Luxembourg-based Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL) is another European EV manufacturer that has tapped the public market in the U.S through the Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) route. The company touts a unique and novel method of designing and producing EVs — a concept called “microfactories.”

Founded in 2015, the company functions with the motive of making available affordable EVs produced by local microfactories.

Arrival recently right-sized its operations by announcing a 30% cut in spending across the organization that also includes the elimination of about 30% of jobs. The company rationalized that the move will help preserve cash:

Arrival has proposed plans that include a realignment of the organisation that would enable it to deliver business priorities until late 2023 primarily utilising the $500mn cash on hand.

The European EV maker has expressed confidence in starting production of its EV van in the third quarter.

Ford (NYSE:F) is among the legacy automakers that have cracked the EV code. It has sort of seamlessly transitioned to EV manufacturing. The Dearborn-based company hasn’t been shy to implement changes and have shown dynamism in reacting to the change in consumers’ tastes and preferences.

CEO Jim Farley has proved to be a proactive leader in that respect. He announced the Ford+ plan in May 2021 that would help the company to shift its focus to EVs and related technologies. Earlier this year, the company reorganized itself in a bid to give what it termed “start-up” speed. The reorganization created Ford Model e, focusing on EVs, and Ford Blue that would leverage its ICE business. The Ford Pro is supposed to support commercial and government customers.

Ford targets annual EV production of over 2 million by 2026 and expects EVs to account for half of its volume by 2030.

The U.S. automaker has had a headstart with its F-150 Lightning EV pickup truck, moving in ahead of  EV market titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It is already selling the Mustang Mach-E and the e-transit van. The company also sells a couple of hybrid vehicles.

Executives from Australia’s lithium industry were inundated by bankers and brokers at the Diggers & Dealers Mining Forum in the outback town of Kalgoorlie this week, talking up deals to secure some of the estimated $42 billion worth of investment needed for metal producers to meet their goals. Global automakers have snapped up producers’ shares on the open market, scrapped over supply agreements and even handed over cash for mine expansions.

“The appetite is insatiable,” Dale Henderson, chief executive officer of Pilbara Minerals Ltd., said in an interview. “Any producer in lithium is very popular at the moment.”

With all net growth in car sales last year coming from EVs, demand for the raw materials in batteries has ramped up suddenly. China dominates the lithium supply chain, so Western nations have sought to develop their own production. Miners in Australia -- home to about half the world’s supply, according to the US Geological Survey -- are now being courted by automakers waving checkbooks.

Liontown Resources Ltd. CEO Tony Ottaviano is careful not to boast about his foresight.

“I don’t want us to come across as self-indulgent because we have immense respect for our customers, but the simple fact is it takes five to eight years to bring greenfield supply online in tier-one jurisdictions,” he said.

When the company first went to carmakers and other manufacturers for its first offtake, “it’s safe to say that interest was low.” Ottaviano said. Most were unsure whether they should get too involved in the metal sourcing process, he explained.

“Roll the clock forward and we are seeing a completely different commercial posture,” he said.

In July, Ford Motor Co. announced an agreement with Liontown for nearly a third of the miner’s expected production over the coming years, at an undisclosed value. The deal also saw Ford provide a A$300 million ($210 million) debt facility to Liontown to further expand its Kathleen Valley site.

That transaction followed Liontown’s earlier so-called offtake deals with Tesla Inc. and South Korean battery maker LG Chem Ltd. It also came a week after European automaker Stellantis NV took an equity stake in Australian lithium miner Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd.

Creative Deals

As recently as 2020, few cared for the natural features of Pilgangoora, a remote Pilbara Minerals site where a red flower called Sturt’s Desert Pea and a few cattle sit atop the one of largest hard-rock lithium ore deposits in the world.

Pilbara’s shares traded at 13 Australian cents then, and have since risen to more than A$2.85, giving it a market value of about $5.8 billion. Shares in Liontown have risen about 76 times since early 2019, to a value of around $2.2 billion.

The increase is mirrored in the price of lithium itself, which gained nearly 500% in the past year. The lithium market will be tight and prices will likely remain elevated for the rest of the year, according to BloombergNEF. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has bemoaned the price spike on Twitter, suggesting the automaker may have to get into the mining and refining game.

Globally, the industry will need as much as $42 billion of investment by the end of the decade in order to meet demand, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

“Appetite for critical minerals from quality jurisdictions is currently the strongest we have seen,” said Campbell Cooper of investment bank Greenhill & Co., which advised Liontown on its recent deal with Ford.

“Given the competitive dynamic, deals need to be flexible and creative to succeed.”

126,UPDATE 1-Tesla stock-split proposal to headline annual meeting in Texas,"(Adds details on proposals)

By Akash Sriram

Aug 4 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc will host its annual general meeting on Thursday, with the world's most valuable automaker's proposal for a second stock split in as many years set to take center stage for investors gathered in Austin, Texas.

Also on the agenda are shareholder proposals for corporate governance-related items, including endorsing the right of employees to form a union and asking the company to report its efforts in preventing racial discrimination and sexual harassment annually. (https://bit.ly/3oT7yGU)

The meeting comes as Tesla chief Elon Musk and Twitter Inc are slugging it out in a legal battle after the world's richest person said last month that he was abandoning a $44 billion takeover offer for the company.

Musk owns 15.6% of Tesla, according to data from Refinitiv, after selling millions of shares over much of the last year.

Tesla first announced its plan to seek investor approval to increase its number of shares in March, two years after a five-for-one split helped bring down the price of the high-flying stock within the reach of ordinary investors. Tesla is now proposing a three-for-one split.

Tesla shares, which debuted at $17 apiece in 2010, rose to more than $1,200 late last year after the 2020 stock split, taking the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion.

While a split does not affect a company's fundamentals, it could buoy the share price by making it easier for a wider range of investors to own the stock.

Tech heavyweights Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc have also announced stock splits in the recent past.

Tesla shareholders will also vote on the board's proposals to reduce the term of its directors to two years from three as well as re-elect Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson.

Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) last month recommended Tesla investors to vote against the two nominees.

Story continues

A shareholder proposal, asking the board to enable large and long-term stockholders or groups with at least 3% of the company's shares to put competing director candidates on the company ballot will be put to vote at the meeting.

Tesla in its proxy filing said this may create an opportunity for special interests that seek only short-term returns rather than having the company's long-term interests in mind.

In a board proposal, the company asked shareholders to approve removing some supermajority voting requirements, saying that it would give its ""stockholders a greater voice"".

Proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS recommended stockholders to vote for both proposals.

The annual meeting is due to start at 5.30 pm ET (2130 GMT).

Video Transcript

- I've learned about sport mode. And I think someone who might use sport mode is Elon Musk, front and center today. Tesla's annual meeting today in Texas that's after tonight. We're hearing about some things like some shareholder nominations for stuff, like board members and also that stock split. But mostly, we're talking about things like, are we going to hear about production? That had a record July-- sorry, record June Tesla said. So are they going to show or talk to us more about what's happening there?

The ramps in Berlin, Austin and Shanghai, are they actually coming up? Are they actually making more, are they actually going to hit that 1.4 to 1.5 million vehicles they think they're going to hit this year? Also pricing. Elon Musk talked about-- I think it was Friday-- that he sees pricing coming down on certain components. So is that really happening? Is that an extended, is that a real kind of trend they're seeing right now?

And finally, any new clues on new plants? Next year, they've got to go to 2.1-2.4 million vehicles next year. Are they going to actually build more plants, expand the current ones. So we'll see what they say about that. Product roadmaps, things like that.

- I'm curious how many questions there will be about my upcoming book, Five Days in Delaware, because there were-- according to The Verge, there were 27 separate requests of Tesla about the Twitter subpoena. So there is a lot of crossover. I'm sure Elon Musk wished that was not the case, but 27 separate requests to Tesla about this upcoming trial. That is not the distraction they want.

- Yeah, it'll come up. But of the stuff that's put up for vote right now, it's more about ESG stuff, corporate board member voting, are you going to allow employees to sue in court versus going to arbitration, things like that, that a lot of activist investors have put forward to the board right now.

Story continues

- The stock split going to get a lot of attention, I'm sure, amongst shareholders as well.

- And that'll probably pass pretty easily. I mean, there's a lot of people are riled up about that three for one stock split. Stocks are what, 900 bucks right now? So it's a pretty-- seems like a fair bet that it would pass.

- All right, Yahoo Finances, [INAUDIBLE], thanks so much.",2022-08-04T20:19:57+00:00,2022-08-04
131,Earnings Continue to Win,"The stock market typically grows bumpy in the late summer as the second-quarter earnings season winds down.

The fact is I believe any dip in my fundamentally superior Accelerated Profits stocks is a good buying opportunity – and based on recent action, I’m not the only one.

Our friends at Bespoke recently pointed out that the bull/bear spread has dropped below 20% for only the fifth time since 1990. When the bull/bear has dropped below 20% before, the S&P 500 went on to post median returns of 2.7% in the following month, 9.19% in the next three months, 14.73% in the following six months, and 20.37% a year out.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

This is a very bullish signal. So, while there may be some short-term volatility, stocks are headed higher long term.

In the near term, earnings are working. In other words, companies are beating estimates and that’s propelling their stock higher; and companies that miss expectations are falling.

A couple of weeks ago we highlighted this with Elon Musk’s Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the electric car maker posted better-than-expected earnings.

Tesla reported earnings per share of $2.27, a 57% increase year-over-year, and revenue of $16.9 billion, a 42% increase from last year. Free cash flow rose above estimates of $500 million, to $619 million.

While some China related supply chain issues were noted, all in TSLA impressed analysts. And the stock popped 10% the next day.

At the same time, my Portfolio Grader system was flashing a buy with Tesla spotting an A grade. Had you been following along you might have picked up shares before the big pop.

In today’s Market360, we are going to look at three companies’ earnings that were recently upgraded in Portfolio Grader and see whether it’s time to buy.

Humana, Inc. (NYSE:HUM) – Grade B

Humana saw one of the biggest upgrades this week, going from a D-rating (Sell) to a B-rating (Buy).

The company reported second-quarter earnings last Wednesday that crushed estimates. Humana reported earnings per share of $8.67, up 26% year-over-year, and $1 above analyst estimates. Revenue jumped 15% year-over-year to $27.72 billion, ahead of estimates for revenue of $23.47 billion.

Story continues

The company also raised guidance for the year to earnings per share from $24.50 to $24.75. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $24.65.

As reported by Investor.com:

The company said that lower utilization among its Medicare Advantage members and lack of Covid headwinds to earnings fueled the earnings beat and guidance raise. However, management said guidance assumes that Covid will become a bigger issue in the fall and a 50-cent EPS drag. Humana also plans to use part of its Q2 windfall to boost marketing outlays for Medicare Advantage.

The day following the report, Humana closed up a little over 1%. And over the weekend, Portfolio Grader upped its ranking to a Buy.

Graco, Inc. (NYSE:GGG) – Grade C

Next up we have American manufacturer Graco. The company went from a D-rating (Sell) last week to a C-rating (Hold) over the weekend.

What changed?

Last Wednesday the company reported second-quarter earnings for its fiscal year 2022. Graco reported earnings per share of $0.68, above analyst expectations for $0.67. The company’s revenue rose 8.1% year-over-year to $548.5 million.

Following the company’s earnings beat, Graco shares rose almost 3% the following trading day.

While it’s not time to buy shares of GGG, it’s definitely worth watching as we head into the third quarter.

Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:TMO) – Grade B

Last up is Thermo Fisher. The company was upgraded to a B-rating (Buy) from a C-rating (Hold) last week.

A week ago, the company topped analyst estimates of second-quarter earnings. Thermo Fisher posted revenue of $10.09 billion, up 18% year-over-year and above the $9.84 billion expected. The company also reported earnings per share of $5.51, exceeding the estimate for earnings of $4.92 per share.

Thermo Fisher Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Marc Casper also raised 2022 full-year revenue forecast by $750 million, a 10% increase over 2021 revenue.

While the company continues to face headwinds from the COVID-19 lockdown in China, amongst other things, Casper said during the earnings call, “We will manage through whatever the world throws at us.”

Shares of TMO rose almost 6% Thursday on the news.

This week, Portfolio Grader raised TMO from a hold to a buy.

Trust the System

The fact is, folks, earnings are working; buy companies with growing revenues and strong reports and you will be rewarded.

We just have to be patient through the last month of the summer… arguably my least favorite month of the year.

In the meantime, if you’re looking for stocks that can make you real income quickly, I urge you to check out last week’s Make Cash Now Project event.

The fact is there is only a very select group of stocks that produce massive amounts of income. And these stocks are the best vehicles for drawing safer, consistent income from the stock market.

We identify these stocks as “accelerated-income generators.” They’re little-known stocks that can go on an incredible run in just a short time.

I revealed everything during last Thursday’s event. If you missed it, you still have time to catch the replay here.

And just moments ago, I released a brand-new accelerated-income generator. It’s an oil producer that’s firing on all cylinders. For its second quarter, this company reported triple-digit earnings growth, and analysts are expecting this growth to continue well into the third quarter, which bodes well for the company’s stock.

Sign up now for access to this exciting recommendation.

Sincerely, Louis Navellier

132,Texas’s Abbott Says Californians Coming to State Tend to Be Conservative,"(Bloomberg) -- Texas Governor Greg Abbott told his fellow conservatives that they don’t need to worry about transplants from California and New York turning the state blue ahead of his re-election.

Abbott spoke about the state’s strong job creation and influx of new businesses and residents, in particular from California, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas on Thursday. He also suggested that many of the California newcomers are conservative and that liberal Texans have moved to the west coast.

“We have an exchange program going on,” Abbott said in jest as the crowd cheered. “We’re getting the California conservatives, we’re sending them our liberals.”

Abbott’s remarks highlight the fear of some long-time Texas residents that newcomers from the coastal cities may bring liberal politics from their home states.

Abbott’s popularity has declined over his tenure, and a recent poll showed that 36% of Texans rate him as very unfavorable, compared to 19% who say he is very favorable. The two-term incumbent governor spoke to a half-empty room.

Polling shows that Abbott is expected to defeat Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke, although his lead has narrowed in recent months after events like the Uvalde school shooting and the US Supreme Court overturning the nationwide right to an abortion.

While many transplants to Texas have come from left-leaning places like California and New York, they have proved to be more conservative than thought. Newcomers voted for Republican Ted Cruz in his 2018 Senate re-election bid at a higher rate than those born in the state, according to a CNN exit poll.

Numerous high-profile companies have relocated or planned large expansions in the state in recent years, including Tesla Inc’s new headquarters in Austin, Samsung Electronics Co’s $17 billion chip facility in Taylor and Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s new office tower in Dallas. Many of these company expansions bring in new, high-paying jobs, which ultimately will drive up prices for housing and other living costs in a state that has long used affordability as a draw.

During his appearance at CPAC, Abbott spoke about his efforts to secure the border, which has been one of his top priorities as he campaigns for re-election on Nov. 8 against O’Rourke. He also said that parents should have a say in their children’s education, which has been a policy priority for Texas Republicans as they focus on school choice and prohibiting books that involve gender and identity.

At the state GOP convention in June, the governor opted to speak at a separate event across the street from where most of the activities were taking place. He’s faced opposition within his own party and ran against a handful of candidates in the primary race in March. Many Republicans are unhappy with the governor for his use of executive authority during the pandemic.

CPAC brings together various high-profile conservatives and Republicans to discuss policy at conferences around the country. The group kicked off its four-day conference in Dallas Thursday.

Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Attorney General Ken Paxton, Senator Ted Cruz and US Representative Mayra Flores will also speak at CPAC, joining Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban and former President Donald Trump.

134,Australian Lithium Stocks Skyrocket on BMW Deal,"By Ambar Warrick

Investing.com-- Shares of Australian lithium miners surged on Friday after local miner European Lithium Ltd (ASX:EUR) said it signed a supply agreement with German car maker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (ETR:BMWG), highlighting the growing demand for the metal in automobile manufacturing.

European Lithium led gains among its peers with a 13% jump, which pushed the stock to a three-month high. Mineral Resources Ltd (ASX:MIN), the largest lithium miner in the country by market capital, jumped over 2%.

Other players, including Core Lithium Ltd (ASX:CXO), Liontown Resources Ltd (ASX:LTR) and Pilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX:PLS), jumped between 2.3% to 5.4% after the deal was announced.

European Lithium said in a press release that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with BMW to provide battery-grade lithium hydroxide to the car maker. The firm has granted BMW the first right to produce all of its lithium produced from certain resources.

The deal comes amid a widespread rush by automobile manufacturers to acquire lithium for producing batteries. Growing demand for electric vehicles has largely driven this trend.

Australian miners- which account for about half the world’s supply of lithium, have seen increasing attempts at courtship by major automobile makers, according to a Bloomberg report.

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co recently announced a supply agreement with Liontown for a bulk of the miner’s produce. The car maker also extended a 300 million Australian dollar (A$) loan to Liontown.

The deal follows an earlier supply agreement between Liontown and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), as well as a deal with South Korean Battery maker LG Chem Ltd (KS:051915).

Growing demand for lithium has also pushed up its prices sixfold in the past year- mirroring a similar rise in the valuations of Australian lithium miners. The trend is likely to continue, as demand for electric vehicles increases.

The split will bring Tesla’s shares down to the $300 range, but the Austin, Texas based-company did not immediately specify as of when it will take effect. Tesla had first announced its plan on March 28 via a tweet.

The four-month lag between announcement and vote is proving to be beneficial: A rally in growth stocks has brought the Nasdaq 100 Index up nearly 20% from a June low, with Tesla outperforming both the tech-heavy index and the broad S&P 500 Index with a gain of nearly 50% from a late-May low.

Tesla rose 0.3% in postmarket trading to $928.55 as of 6:34 p.m. in New York. The stock has been on an upswing over the past month, rising 37% since the end of June as of Thursday’s close.

“Tesla’s stock split timing looks impeccable,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin said, noting the shareholder vote is coming at a time when the “market seems to be heading in the right direction.”

Tesla’s recent rebound -- it posted a 32% gain in July for its best month since October -- comes on the back of resilient second-quarter results and a bit of a lift from the climate change bill from the Biden Administration, which aims to boost the use of clean energy through a series of tax incentives.

Most of the risks that weighed on the company earlier this year still linger, with supply-chain disruptions far from sorted, tensions between the US and China rising, and Elon Musk involved in a potentially lengthy and costly legal dispute with Twitter Inc. Moreover, recent high profile stock splits have failed to give a meaningful boost to other giants including Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com this year.

For Tesla, this will be the second share-split in less than two years. The company had a five-for-one stock split in 2020, prompting a 60% surge in the share price from the day of the announcement to the execution date. The company already has a fairly strong retail investor following, often making it the stock with the most buy orders on Fidelity’s retail trading platform.

Even though stock splits do not impact the business model of a company, they bring in a sense of affordability by lowering the price of the shares, especially for mom-and-pop investors, market watchers say.

“Owning the whole share can be less complicated and more empowering, and these companies know that,” said Callie Cox, eToro US investment analyst. “There’s clearly an underlying desire in this market for any company to make its stock as accessible as possible. And so far, investors have responded to that.”

The initiatives to shorten director terms to two years from three and also to shift to a simple majority of votes did not receive support from enough shareholders, Martin Viecha, Tesla’s head of investor relations, said Thursday at the company’s annual meeting, citing preliminary results.

Viecha said more than 97% of investors who did vote approved the two proposals, but that the total number of shareholders who voted was below the two-thirds hurdle needed to pass them.

Tesla’s proposal to reduce director tenures came in response to a shareholder resolution last year calling for board members to face election annually -- which received the support of 57% of votes cast. The company has said longer terms will allow it to better fend off “opportunistic corporate raiders” and “special interests that seek only short-term returns.”

An outside proposal also failed to pass that would have allowed shareholders who’ve held at least 3% of the electric vehicle market leader’s stock for at least three years to place director candidates.

Shareholders did approve a proposed three-for-one stock split and the re-election of two directors — venture capitalist Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson -- as well as the ratification of Tesla’s accounting firm, according to the preliminary data.

Speaking at the electric-vehicle maker’s annual shareholder meeting, Musk said the company’s commodity and component costs are trending downward over the next six months. He also reiterated prior comments that he expects a mild recession to hit that could last 18 months.

“The trend is down, which suggests we are past peak inflation,” Musk said at Tesla’s Austin headquarters and factory. “I think inflation is going to drop rapidly” at some point in the future, he said.

Global central banks have embarked on a path of policy-tightening as inflation pressures consumers and corporate bottom lines. In the US, consumer prices increased by 9.1% in June from a year earlier, and Federal Reserve officials say the price gains have yet to slow. The next print on inflation comes Aug. 10.

“We sort of have some insight in to where prices are headed over time,” Musk said, citing the company’s need to buy raw materials often months in advance of when they will be used.

“The interesting thing that we are seeing now is that most of our commodities, most of the things that go in to a Tesla -- not all, but more than half -- the prices are trending down in six months,” he added.

While Tesla has a global purview on input costs and consumer health, Musk warned on stage that making “macroeconomic prognostications is a recipe for disaster” and said his comments were a “guess” and “total speculation.” The CEO also warned that the trend could change.

Reservation holders and future customers of the upcoming futuristic Cybertruck may fall victim to the impacts of inflation, Musk suggested. The ‘Blade Runner’-inspired pickup was unveiled in 2019 and “a lot has changed” since then, he said. At the time the company started taking reservations, the most basic model was being discussed as a $39,900 vehicle.

“The specs and the pricing will be different,” Musk said. “I hate to give a little bit of bad news. But there is no way to have anticipated the inflation we have seen and various issues.”

China Announces Sanctions on Nancy Pelosi Over Taiwan Trip China Likely Fired Missiles Over Taiwan in Drills, Japan Says Democrats Drop Carried Interest as Sinema Paves Way for Tax Vote

The landmark legislation President Joe Biden is counting on to motivate Americans to vote for Democrats in the upcoming midterm election has put Mary Barra in a somewhat awkward spot.

Significant support for automakers making the switch to electric vehicles and major changes to corporate taxation have pitted the automaker Barra leads against the powerful Washington lobby group she chairs. Fortunately for General Motors and unfortunately for the Business Roundtable, the bill would be such a boon to EVs that coming out clearly in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act was an easy decision.

Barra joined several other CEOs and labor leaders who met virtually with Biden on Thursday and endorsed the bill that would fund clean-energy investments by closing corporate-tax loopholes and making big corporations pay more. On the surface, at least, it appears GM and other automakers supporting the measure are accepting the plan’s 15% floor on their tax rate in exchange for federal help converting their plants, future models and sales to EVs. The bill would revive the $7,500 tax credit for GM, Toyota and Tesla and introduce a new $4,000 perk for consumers purchasing a cleaner used car. Other incentives include tax credits for domestic mineral production and EV battery manufacturing.

The tax portion is less welcome for big corporations, which explains why the Business Roundtable has vocally opposed the bill. GM and Ford are among companies that pay little in federal tax and could end up paying more. GM reported a tax expense of $20 million on almost $10 billion of income last year, and paid less than $100 million in years prior. Ford paid $102 million on almost $18 billion of income in 2021.

Both companies take advantage of legal and legitimate credit systems and loopholes. For GM, paying the full 15% minimum corporate tax on the $9.5 billion they made in the US would come to $1.4 billion.

Story continues

As the bill stands, though, the 15% minimum tax isn’t actually a minimum. Companies can still pay below that because they would be allowed credits for research-and-development spending, defined benefit pension plans, past operating losses and foreign tax credits, according to Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank. Corporate taxes likely will go up for many companies, he said, just not as much as the plan’s headline might suggest.

For GM, a potentially higher tax bill probably would be more than offset by a lot of perks. The company could certainly use EV tax credits to get back on equal footing with automakers that haven’t reached the 200,000-vehicle cap that GM, Tesla and Toyota have, which triggers the phase-out of current incentives. Next year, Barra will roll out electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Equinox and Blazer SUVs that could benefit from support from Uncle Sam.

What remains to be seen is how many models, if any, will be eligible for these credits right away. Automakers will need to hit certain benchmarks for how much of the materials and components in their batteries are sourced locally, or at least not from China and other countries of concern. Carmakers are pressing Congress to ease up on those requirements.

If the bill passes — crucially, Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema is now on board — automakers may end up racing to bring more of their battery supply chain to America, which is exactly what Biden wants. Barra said during Thursday’s roundtable that while “some of the goals cannot be achieved overnight,” GM is confident the significant investments it’s making “will establish the US as a global leader today and in the future.”

If you want to see more stocks that are positioned to be beneficiaries of the Chinese economic slump, click 5 American Stocks That Will Benefit from China's Economic Slowdown.

China has undoubtedly inflicted a lot of economic wounds on itself as of late, and now even the public is protesting the state of the domestic economy. Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, said on August 1 in an interview with Fortune that most of the Chinese public sees the “problems as driven by [the government’s] misguided policies”. Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to preside over a third term, and if he stands by his controversial policies that are damaging China’s economy and giving rise to public dissent, it could make it more difficult for Jinping to execute his vision.

China’s Slow GDP Growth

US-China relations have been strained for quite some time now, yet they remain important strategic trade partners. The United States is already facing recession threats and the latest GDP data shows economic contraction. The Chinese economic slowdown could impact the US, as well as global economies, as China is one of the world’s top exporters. Recently, China posted its Q2 GDP growth of 0.40%, below the market consensus of 1% growth. This was the worst GDP growth recorded by China since the economy shrunk 6.8% in Q1 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

China is one of the largest exporters to the US, supplying electronics and machinery, oilseeds, furniture, steel, and automotive parts and accessories. The supply chain bottlenecks and the zero-Covid policy are hurting the Chinese economy, and on top of that, real estate sales in China could decline by one-third this year. Latest reports suggest that the Chinese government is planning to pump about $44 billion into the real estate sector to give it a boost, and the credit rating agency S&P has predicted that property sales declining will be twice as bad as previous forecasts for 2022.

Story continues

In light of the Chinese crisis of supply constraints, geopolitical tensions, zero-Covid measures, the property slump, and lack of economic growth, domestic American companies are set to benefit from higher demand. As tensions are also skyrocketing between Washington and Beijing amid the Taiwan crisis, exports to the US are likely to be impacted. This makes way for the machinery, agriculture, furniture, automobiles, and electrical equipment companies in the US to fill the supply gap and benefit from China’s economic slowdown. Some of the most prominent American beneficiaries of the Chinese slump could

China is an exporter of fresh fruits and vegetables to the United States, and amid an economic slowdown, Calavo Growers, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVGW) is one of the American stocks positioned to benefit from the situation.

On June 3, Lake Street analyst Ben Klieve observed that Calavo Growers, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVGW)’s Q2 results outperformed market estimates on both the top and bottom line and margins reflected ""real indications of sustained improvement"" in a quarter that he argued ""represents the clearest sign yet that the restructuring efforts are paying off"". The analyst reiterated a Buy rating and a $60 price target on Calavo Growers, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVGW) stock.

Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 12 funds reported owning stakes in Calavo Growers, Inc.

On July 6, Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba maintained an Equal Weight rating on United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) and lowered the price target on the shares to $20 from $27. As per the analyst, steel prices have deteriorated quicker from their March peak than he anticipated and he is marking-to-market his steel and scrap price forecasts for 2022 and 2023, which also led him to cut estimates and price targets across his Americas Steel coverage.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 37 hedge funds were bullish on United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) at the end of Q1 2022, with collective stakes worth $1.6 billion, compared to 39 funds in the last quarter, holding stakes in the company valued at $760.60 million. Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners is the biggest position holder in the company, with 11.6 million shares worth roughly $441 million.

8. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38

Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) is headquartered in San Francisco, California, operating as an omni-channel specialty retailer of home products such as cookware, tools, electronics, cutlery, and furniture under the Williams Sonoma Home brand. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) declared on June 16 a $0.78 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on August 26, to shareholders of record on July 22.

Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Select Equity Group held the largest position in Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) at the conclusion of Q1 2022, comprising 955,342 shares worth $138.5 million. Overall, 38 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of March 2022.

Here is what Voss Capital has to say about Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (NYSE:WSM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“We believe shorting furniture retailers has arguably become a consensus view on the back of widely known tough comps from early 2021 (+26% and +40% SSS Comps for WSM in calendar Q1/Q2 ‘21) and fear of pull forward of demand, which seems to be corroborated by weak credit card data in the category the last few weeks and a poor outlook from furniture e-Commerce giant Wayfair, not to mention a panic-inducing, rambling conference call from the oft colorful CEO of Restoration Hardware. Lazy thematic macro analysis that stops there, however, paints an incomplete picture of what has transpired at many individual companies like WSM that have been deemed COVID beneficiaries that are now at all-time low valuations.

WSM is a furniture and home décor retailer that owns several well-known brands: William Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Rejuvenation, Mark & Graham, and most importantly, west elm. While perhaps thought of as a dying mall-based brick & mortar retailer, WSM derives the vast majority (66%+) of its revenue from e-Commerce and has been a remarkably steady performer, remaining free cash flow positive every year since at least 2007 and achieving positive same store sales comps since 2010, including +17% in 2020, +22% in 2021 with guidance for a further mid-to-high single digit growth again this year. Within the overall positive sales trends, west elm’s consistent growth has been even more impressive, with a 16% average annual same-store sales growth rate since 2012. To little fanfare, by our calculation, WSM has become the single highest quality retailer in public markets with a 58% return on invested capital (ROIC) in 2021 and a 39% ROIC on average over the past 3 years…” (Click here to see the full text)

7. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN)

Like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), smart investors are monitoring Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) amid China’s weakening economic situation.

Here is what Baron Fund has to say about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“Ford (NYSE:F) is another example of typical industrial manufacturing business executive mindsets. The April 18, 2022, Bloomberg Businessweek cover story features Ford CEO Jim Farley behind the wheel of an electrified Ford F-150 Lightning. The article is titled, “Hey Elon, THIS is a truck.” I thought the article was terrific. One idea especially stood out to me. Since the F-150 is such a popular vehicle, it “argued for a gradual approach to electrification. Essentially the company retrofitted an existing F-150 with an electric powertrain rather than develop an entirely new truck.” No all-in financial and operation bet by this company on electrification.”

Germany is the largest economy in Europe by gross domestic product, followed by the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Russia. Germany recorded an annual GDP of $4.22 trillion in 2021, which represents approximately 4.4% of the world's GDP of $96.1 trillion in 2021. Germany recorded year-over-year GDP growth of 7.5% in 2021 but as we entered into 2022, the economy was met with supply chain challenges, inflation, and an energy crisis among other macro pressures.

Russia Cutting Off Gas Supply to Germany

For decades Germany has relied on Russia for oil and natural gas to heat its homes and fuel its industries. On July 25, it was reported that Russia will further cut gas supplies to Germany through Nord Stream 1 because of sanctions and a turbine problem. This cut reduced gas supply to Germany by one-fifth of the pipeline's capacity. Meanwhile, the European Union announced that member states have agreed to cut gas demand by 15% in order to reduce their reliance on Russia.

Inflation In Germany

Inflation in Germany has started to decline. According to data from Germany's Federal Statistics Office, the CPI in Germany was reported at 7.6% in June, down from 7.9% in May 2022. For July, the Federal Statistics Office of Germany expects the consumer price index to fall to 7.5% year over year, registering the second consecutive decline. In June the energy index dipped to 38%, from 38.3% in May, and is forecasted to record a reading of 35.7% for July. While energy spending is declining, the food index is rising. The food index rose to 12.7% in June from 11.1% in May and is expected to record a reading of 14.8% for July.

Investing in German Stocks

While the German economy is faced with macro pressures, it is still the largest economy in Europe and home to some of the industry-leading companies that export products all over the world. Germany is renowned for manufacturing some of the most luxurious automobiles and top-quality electronic products. Investors looking to diversify their portfolios can explore these companies that have promising fundamentals and massive growth potential.

Video Transcript

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS: Well, it wouldn't be Musk if he wasn't doing 15 things at once. So yesterday also, we had the shareholders meeting. And Pras, there, they got the split approved, but there were some other headlines that came out of that shareholder meeting as well.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, that's right, Julie. They passed that three-for-one stocks. But also elected two board-- reelected two board members. But yeah, a lot of it was Musk commentary. And a number of things riffing on production, inflation, and also the Cybertruck want to hit a couple of these things here.

So on production, he said that Tesla passed the three million market in terms of cars produced overall. A pretty big market as 10 years ago, they're only making the Roadster. He says that in the next 10 years, he sees 100 million cars being produced. And that he ideally see that the company will have 12 factories around the world. And hopefully, he did say that the next step he might be in North America, and teased Canada as the next location.

On inflation, he elaborated more on what he had said last week about how he saw prices actually coming down. He says that the car makers has a lot of visibility and pricing for components and things like that. Says the US is likely past peak inflation. And then he said-- broader, he said that the US might be in for a relatively mild recession is what he says. But he says that take these with a grain of salt, because economic prognostications are always fraught with disaster.

Lastly, the Cybertruck, probably one of the most highly anticipated cars that Tesla has ever made. He says that they're on track for 2023 production, midway through the year. But the specs and pricing likely to change. He apologized for that but he said three years ago when the car was introduced, the world is a different place, inflation wasn't necessarily around. So he says that-- and he called it a bit of bad news, but he said that this car-- this truck is still on track for 2023.

BRIAN SOZZI: Pras, this thing is going to be priced at the same price as that new GMC Electric Hummer. Let's get real. The huge production cost to make this happen, but something we will continue to monitor. Alexis, Pras, thanks so much.",2022-08-05T14:49:42+00:00,2022-08-05

163,Tesla urged to build gigafactory in Teesside as Elon Musk plots new plants around the world,"MARCH 22: Newly completed Tesla electric cars at the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 - Getty Images Europe

Elon Musk has been urged to bring a Tesla plant to the North East of England after the electric car company revealed its ambition to build a dozen “gigafactories” across the world.

Ben Houchen, the Conservative Mayor for Tees Valley, wrote to Mr Musk on Friday calling on the Tesla billionaire to bring an electric car plant to the North East.

In a letter seen by The Telegraph, Mr Houchen wrote: “In the UK, where we have an £82bn automobile industry which leads the world in production of high end vehicles, it would surely make sense for Tesla to develop a serious presence, with Teesside being the best possible location to do this.”

The Mayor said Teesside could offer Tesla “hundreds of acres of ideal developable land” while avoiding “the bureaucratic entanglements seen at other sites”.

Tesla has experienced delays getting its Berlin car factory up and running and Mr Musk has bemoaned the red tape involved in opening the German plant. The project has encountered objections from unions and environmental protesters.

Mr Houchen’s letter came after Mr Musk on Thursday night said Tesla planned to open up to a dozen more electric car factories to add to its plants in California, New York, Texas, Berlin and Shanghai. He told investors the company planned to build “at least 10 or 12 gigafactories” and could announce its next site by the end of the year.

The electric car company is currently planning to produce 1.5 million vehicles in 2022, but Mr Musk ultimately wants Tesla to build as many as 20 million cars per year. That would be double the number of Toyota, the world's largest car manufacturer, which sold 9.6 million cars last year.

Mr Houchen said Teesside would be able to offer Tesla access to customs incentives via the Teesside Freeport, which opened in November 2021.

A total of 21,000 new Tesla’s have hit the road in the UK so far this year, according to industry figures. The UK has banned new petrol vehicle sales from 2030.

At Tesla’s shareholders meeting on Thursday, Mr Musk asked investors to shout out where he should build his next factory. He said: “We got a lot of Canada, I am half-Canadian, maybe I should?” Mr Musk was born in South Africa to a Canadian mother.

Story continues

Mr Musk previously told Tesla staff that he was considering other sites in North America for a future factory, including Canada and Mexico.

In 2019, he said Brexit prevented him from picking the UK for a Tesla factory.

“Brexit made it too risky to put a gigafactory in the UK,"" the billionaire said.

He also floated the idea of bringing a factory to Russia while speaking to an audience in Moscow in 2021. However, the billionaire has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine following Russia’s invasion and has provided assistance in the form of satellite connectivity via his Starlink business.

Mr Musk’s factory plans come as electric van start-up Arrival, which has a factory in Oxford, paused work on a planned electric car and electric bus as it seeks to slash costs. Shares in Arrival have fallen nearly 80pc so far this year.

In July, Tesla reported its revenues had fallen for the first time in a quarter after lockdowns in China held up car production.

Tesla shares have rebounded in the last month to around $922, although they remain around 20pc down on the start of the year. Tesla said on Thursday it would conduct a three-to-one stock split on its issued shares.

Sales of electric cars are growing in the UK even as the wider car industry sales suffer. On Thursday, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported a 9pc fall in new registrations for July, although electric vehicles grew their market share to 10pc.",2022-08-05T15:04:00+00:00,2022-08-05
164,S&amp;P 500 Slips as Surging U.S. Yields Dent Tech Amid Blowout Jobs Report,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 eased from its lows Friday, but remained under pressure by a fall in tech after a blowout monthly jobs report stoked expectations for larger rate hikes sending Treasury yields surging higher.

The S&P 500 fell 0.44%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.34%, or 111 points, the Nasdaq was up 1.91%.

The U.S. economy added 528,000 new jobs in July, topping consensus for 250,000 new jobs in June, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 3.5%.

The jobs report also flagged an uptick in wage pressures that will likely keep inflation elevated, and give the Federal Reserve the green light to continue front-loading rate hikes.

Traders are betting the Federal Reserve’s peak interest rates, or the so-called terminal rate, is at 3.6%, but this won’t be enough to stem inflation given the strong labor market, Jefferies said.

“The terminal rate currently priced into the curve looks woefully inadequate. We expect the Fed to keep hiking through Q1’23 until they push the funds rate to 4-4.25%,” Jefferies added.

If the Fed turns more hawkish than expected, “the market will take that as a big negative, because right now it's pricing in a Fed funds rate that is nearer to the end of cycle,” Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.

Two-year U.S. Treasury yields, which are sensitive to Fed rate hikes, jumped to its highest level in nearly two months. The 10-year yield also soared, rising more than 6%.

Growth sectors of the market, which tend to be unattractive in a rising rate environment, were the hardest hit with big tech and consumer discretionary stocks leading the downside.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) led the move lower in consumer stocks, down 7% after shareholders backed the company’s proposed 3-for-1 stock split.

The earnings front, meanwhile, served up mixed quarterly results with LYFT the standout performer on the day following stronger than expected earnings.

LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) jumped 7% after the ride-hailing company reported a surprise quarterly profit as demand jumped to pre-pandemic levels.

AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) reported a slightly wider-than-expected quarterly loss and announced that it would issue dividend to all common shareholders in the form of preferred shares.

The move in effect “creates a two-for-one stock split, with half listed under 'AMC' and half under 'APE' [stock ticker],” Wedbush said.

Block (NYSE:SQ) fell 2% despite delivering quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines as investors digested a 34% slump in its Cash App business.

166,"Tesla: Musk talks production, pricing and Cybertruck at the company's annual meeting","It was business as usual at Tesla’s (TSLA) annual meeting last night, peppered with commentary from CEO Elon Musk across a number of topics like car production, supply chain and pricing, and of course the status of the Cybertruck.

A number of proposals were put to shareholders to vote on, key among them management’s desire for a 3 for 1 stock split, which was approved by shareholders. Based on yesterday’s closing price the new share price would be around $308.

Musk’s presentation to shareholders started with revealing the company had recently just produced its 3 millionth vehicle. Musk also said is attempting to achieve a 2 million vehicle run rate by the end of the year. Elon Musk at Tesla's 2022 annual meeting

Musk also gave his best guess about the future of production. “What about the next 10 years? I’ll be surprised if it’s not over 100 million in 10 years,” Musk said.

Musk also stated that the ideal number of factories would be twelve, meaning the company has a long way to go. Currently it has gigafactories in Fremont, Shanghai, Austin, and Berlin, along with battery and solar operations in Nevada and Buffalo, NY.

As for its next factory, Musk hinted it could be in north of the border. After a number of attendees suggested several locations, Musk said, “We got a lot of Canada. I am half Canadian, maybe I should?” Musk previously had said Tesla was looking at locations in North America for its next factory.

Pricing, supply chain, and the economy

Musk also gave investors more color on his thoughts on pricing, supply chain, and the economy. Last Friday Musk tweeted that he is seeing pricing coming down for certain components. Musk elaborated more on that, claiming that Tesa gets “a fair bit of insight into where prices of things are going over time because when you’re making millions of cars, you have to purchase commodities many months in advance of when they’re needed,” and from that vantage point, he believes the country is “past peak inflation.”

Musk continued with his prognostications, predicting that the U.S. is likely in for a “relatively mild recession.” He did however add a grain of salt to this claim, warning that making predictions about the economy is usually a “recipe for disaster.”

Speaking of pricing and inflation, the question came up of the status of Tesla’s Cybertruck pickup, quite possibly the automaker’s most highly anticipated vehicle. Musk said the CyberTruck was still slated for mid-2023 production at Giga Austin, though he warned things there were some changes.

“Cybertruck pricing, it was unveiled in 2019, and the reservation was $99. A lot has changed since then, so the specs and the pricing will be different,” Musk said, “I hate to give sort of a little bit of bad news, but I think there's no way to sort of have anticipated quite the inflation that we've seen and the various issues.”

Musk did not say what specifications would change for the Cybertruck.

As for a few odds and ends, Musk said Tesla AI Day part 2 was slated for September 30th, that FSD (Full Self Driving) Beta software will hopefully have a widespread release by the end of this year, and that as far as succession plans go, he intends to stay at Tesla so long as he is useful to the company.

Also at the meeting, board members Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson were also re-elected as directors of the board; however, proposals to shorten board member terms to two years instead of three, and to shift board voting from supermajority to a simple majority failed. Martin Viecha, Tesla’s head of investor relations, said these two proposals failed to pass because less than two-thirds of shareholders failed to vote on these measures, which is a required threshold.

Happy birthday, George Jetson!

Over the weekend, memes circulated that July 31 would have marked the birthday of The Jetson’s patriarch.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Perhaps flying cars are next, notes Luke Lango.

And Luke may well be right. Today’s eVTOL makers are advancing so quickly that levitating vehicles could one day be as ordinary as today’s smartphones. (I’m personally waiting on a robot housekeeper).

The same is beginning to happen with electric vehicles (EVs). Last week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin revealed their bill that would give a $7,500 tax credit to any American buying an EV. The deal would also remove the 200,000-vehicle phase-out that currently make General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ineligible for the credit.

A 2023 Chevy Bolt could cost as little as $18,100 if the deal makes it through the Senate.

That would be game-changing for electric vehicle adoption. Only five other car models tracked by U.S. News and World Report have an MSRP under that figure. And that includes the Mitsubishi Mirage, a car so bad that Car and Driver gave it a 2.5/10 rating for its “sloth-like” acceleration and “rudimentary” interiors.

Meanwhile, a Jetson’s-like future beckons. General Motors’ Bolt already earns strong reviews for its “unexpectedly roomy interior” and “peppy response.” A price cut will make it one of the few new cars available for under $20,000. A chart showing MSRP for the Chevy Bolt by model year

Is the Inflation Reduction Act Bad News for TSLA Stock?

The Inflation Reduction Act tax credit, however, will make far less of a difference for TSLA stock and other high-end EV makers. The legislation phases out credits for sedans and wagons at $55,000 and SUVs at $80,000. None of Tesla’s current models would make the cut.

Story continues

Moving down-market will also be a challenge. Toyota (NYSE:TM) and General Motors already produce around 10 million vehicles per year, giving them enormous scale in cheaper vehicles. A tangle of local and state laws in the U.S. also creates barriers for opening new dealerships; new entrants from India’s Tata Group to China’s homegrown SAIC brands have struggled to make inroads into the American market.

These are issues for Tesla’s long-term growth potential, as well as high-end competitors Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID), Faraday Future (NASDAQ:FFIE) and Fisker (NYSE:FSR). Unlike the iPhone, where expensive models still cost less than the average performance laptop, high-end EVs are prohibitively expensive for all but the wealthiest of Americans. Monthly payments for new Model S cars run over $2,000 — a figure that needs between $250,000 to $350,000 annual incomes to comfortably afford, according to financial planning professionals. The tax credit will further widen this divide.

The bill won’t kill off TSLA stock. But it will certainly limit its growth potential by helping lower-priced competitors.

The Winners of the Schumer-Manchin Deal

So, who wins from the Senate’s $350 billion put towards greenifying the American economy?

In one sense, financially stable consumers stand to gain. The Schumer-Manchin deal not only provides a $7,500 tax credit to EV buyers. In its current form, the bill also extends tax credits on solar panels and creates a $4,000 one for used EVs. A deal on drug pricing could also cap Medicare payments to $2,000 out-of-pocket expenses.

But the effect for investors is more complex, especially for electric vehicle makers. (The bill’s critics will note it raises taxes on middle-income families and does little to cut inflation). The 10-year, $10 billion investment tax credit for clean-tech manufacturing facilities will get diluted among dozens of players; General Motors alone generated that figure in profits in 2021. And if every existing player receives a prorated amount from the fund, the tax benefits quickly become a zero-sum game.

It’s why “picks-and-shovels” plays have generally outperformed their vehicle-producing peers. Companies like battery research firm QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) saw their share price rise above $12 for the first time in two months on the announcement. And troubled solar firm Sunrun (NYSE:SUN) would see shares jump almost 40% on the news of the bill.

And that’s where an investment in Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) comes in.

The “Picks-and-Shovels” Play for the EV Industry

Lithium Americas is a winning combination of safety and growth for the Profit & Protection list. Unlike QuantumScape and other emerging-growth companies (i.e., zero-revenue firms), LAC will produce lithium — an ingredient that’s already used in current-day production. As mentioned in Friday’s newsletter, “Lithium Americas is a safer way to play the electric vehicle boom.”

That’s because, no matter which electric vehicle maker comes out ahead, each car will still need anywhere from 5-15kg of lithium metal to produce.

At the same time, LAC still has greater upside than rival Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) and other established lithium miners. LAC is still a startup with three projects in its pipeline and trades at a gaping “uncertainty discount” for that sin. Analysts at Morningstar peg LAC’s fair value at $65, a 160% upside even after factoring in startup risks.

That said, LAC does have some issues. Its Nevada mine at Thacker Pass has been dogged by lawsuits from activists, despite receiving approvals from both the Trump and Biden administrations. And it’s still unclear whether the firm’s Argentinian resources will qualify for the upcoming tax credits for clean-energy production.

Nevertheless, for those seeking startup-style returns, LAC provides far better downside protection thanks to its potentially low-cost production and the world’s insatiable demand for battery materials.

One More “Moonshot” Electric Vehicle Play

Luke Lango has also been taking a close look at the winners of the electric vehicle revolution. And a tiny company has caught his eye.

It’s not Lucid Motors…

Nor is it Tesla…

Even the Jetsons knew that fossil fuels would eventually disappear. Every oil field … every gas project … every fossil fuel reserve has a limited lifespan. Europe’s North Sea oil fields produce less than a third of what they once did in the late 1990s because the fields eventually run out. Even today’s advanced fracking technology will eventually drain America’s Permian basin.

In its place, vehicles will need a source of high-density energy.

Some believe hydrogen fuels are an answer. And the technology will have a place in transportation, especially where constant-use vehicles like forklifts and taxis have no time to recharge.

But for the remaining 90% of electric vehicles, lithium-ion technology reigns supreme. And investors who get in early on companies like Lithium Americas are the ones that stand to gain.

Investing.com -- The Dow racked up gains late into the close to end higher Friday, on a jump in banking and energy stocks, but surging Treasury yields following a blowout jobs report weighed on tech keeping gains in the broader market in check.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.23%, or 76 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.50%, and the S&P 500 fell 0.18%.

The U.S. economy added 528,000 new jobs in July, topping consensus for 250,000 new jobs in June, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 3.5%.

The jobs report also flagged an uptick in wage pressures that will likely keep inflation elevated, and give the Federal Reserve the green light to continue front-loading rate hikes.

Traders are betting the Federal Reserve’s peak interest rates, or the so-called terminal rate, is at 3.6%, but this won’t be enough to stem inflation given the strong labor market, Jefferies said.

“The terminal rate currently priced into the curve looks woefully inadequate. We expect the Fed to keep hiking through Q1’23 until they push the funds rate to 4-4.25%,” Jefferies added.

If the Fed turns more hawkish than expected, “the market will take that as a big negative, because right now it's pricing in a Fed funds rate that is nearer to the end of cycle,” Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.

Two-year U.S. Treasury yields, which are sensitive to Fed rate hikes, jumped to its highest level in nearly two months. The 10-year yield also soared, rising more than 6%.

Growth sectors of the market, which tend to be unattractive in a rising rate environment, were the hardest hit with big tech and consumer discretionary stocks leading the downside.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) led the move lower in consumer stocks, down 6% after shareholders backed the company’s proposed 3-for-1 stock split.

Energy rose 2% to pare some losses from a day earlier as oil prices rebounded as fears about a recession hurting demand eased following the stronger jobs report.

Banking stocks including JPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM), meanwhile, led financials higher as rising rates tend to support lending margins.

The earnings front, meanwhile, served up mixed quarterly results with LYFT the standout performer on the day following stronger than expected earnings.

LYFT (NASDAQ:LYFT) jumped 16% after the ride-hailing company reported a surprise quarterly profit as demand jumped to pre-pandemic levels.

AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) reported a slightly wider-than-expected quarterly loss and announced that it would issue dividend to all common shareholders in the form of preferred shares. Its shares jumped nearly 19%.

The move in effect “creates a two-for-one stock split, with half listed under 'AMC' and half under 'APE' [stock ticker],” Wedbush said.

Block (NYSE:SQ) fell 2% despite delivering quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines as investors digested a 34% slump in its Cash App business.

* Nonfarm payrolls beat expectations in July

* Lyft surges as record earnings overshadow cautious outlook

* Indexes down: S&P 500 -0.40%, Nasdaq -0.76%, Dow +0.01% (Updates with details of afternoon trading)

By Devik Jain and Noel Randewich

Aug 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on Friday, weighed down by Tesla and other technology-related stocks after a solid jobs report torpedoed recent optimism that the Federal Reserve might let up its aggressive campaign to reign in decades-high inflation.

Data showed U.S. employers hired far more workers than expected in July, the 19th straight month of payrolls expansion, with the unemployment rate falling to a pre-pandemic low of 3.5%.

The report added to recent data painting an upbeat picture of the world's largest economy after it contracted in the first half of the year. That deflated investors' expectations that the Fed might let up in its series of rate hikes aimed at cooling the economy.

""This is all about the Fed. A very strong jobs report like we had puts pressure on the Fed to tighten for longer,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments. ""The market is scared the Fed is going to overshoot again. If they tighten too sharply and too long, that's going to cause a hard landing, a deep recession.""

Tesla tumbled 6% and weighed heavily on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Facebook-owner Meta Platforms lost 2.5% and Amazon declined 1.6%.

U.S. Treasury yields climbed as odds increased of a 75-basis-point interest rate hike in September. That helped bank stocks, with JPMorgan rallying about 3%.

Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, eight declined, led lower by consumer discretionary, down 1.93%, followed by a 1.13% loss in communication services.

Focus now shifts to inflation data due next week, with U.S. annual consumer prices expected to jump by 8.7% in July after a 9.1% rise in June.

Several policymakers have this week stuck to an aggressive policy tightening stance until they see strong and long-lasting evidence that inflation was trending toward the Fed's 2% goal.

Surging inflation, the war in Ukraine, Europe's energy crisis and COVID-19 flare-ups in China have rattled investors this year.

A largely upbeat second-quarter earnings season has helped the S&P 500 bounce back by about 13% from its mid-June lows after a rough first-half performance.

In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was down 0.40% at 4,135.24 points.

The Nasdaq declined 0.76% to 12,623.40 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.01% at 32,729.03 points.

Lyft Inc surged almost 16% after the ride-hailing firm forecast an adjusted operating profit of $1 billion for 2024 after posting record quarterly earnings.

Across the U.S. stock market, declining stocks outnumbered rising ones by a 1.3-to-1 ratio.

The California DMV has accused the electric carmaker of false advertising over its self-driving claims. (Getty Images)

The California Department of Motor Vehicles has accused Tesla of false advertising in its promotion of the company’s signature Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies.

The agency alleges the electric carmaker misled customers with advertising language on its website describing Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies as more capable than they actually are.

The company “made or disseminated statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts,” the DMV said in a pair of complaints filed with the state Office of Administrative Hearings on July 28.

The DMV complaints point to the very names of the technologies, as well as other “misleading” language such as the following, which appears on the Tesla's website Autopilot page:

“All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you don't say anything, your car will look at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigating urban streets, complex intersections and freeways.”

The remedies proposed by the DMV if it prevails could be severe, including revocation of the company's licenses to make or sell its cars in California. But actual remedies would likely be much softer.

A DMV spokesperson said Friday via email that if its action succeeds, ""the DMV will ask that Tesla will be required to advertise to consumers and better educate Tesla drivers about the capabilities of its ‘Autopilot’ and ‘Full Self-Driving’ features, including cautionary warnings regarding the limitations of the features, and for other actions as appropriate given the violations.""

In June, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk underlined the importance of Full Self-Driving to the company. Without FSD, Tesla is ""worth basically zero,"" he said.

The Full Self-Driving feature costs $12,000 and purports to automatically pilot the car on freeways, city streets and neighborhood roads; automatically obey traffic signals; and roam a parking lot without a driver to park itself.

Story continues

Despite the name, no car available for purchase by individuals is capable of fully autonomous driving from Tesla or any other company.

Tesla cars never could “and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles,” the DMV claims assert.

The DMV notes that Tesla’s website states that “the currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.”

But, the DMV said, the disclaimer “contradicts the original untrue or misleading labels and claims, which is misleading, and does not cure the violation.”

Tesla’s driver-assisting technologies have been popular features that help the carmaker stand out in an increasingly crowded electric vehicle market. But YouTube videos showing its systems placing cars in dangerous situations have drawn attention, including near head-on collisions with trucks and trains that require a driver to yank the steering wheel to avoid a crash. One video appears to show Tesla’s sensor system confusing the moon for a traffic light stuck on yellow.

Autopilot, a less expensive feature that combines automatic cruise control with automatic steering and automatic lane changes, came under investigation by the National Highway and Traffic Administration when Teslas showed a pattern of plowing into emergency vehicles parked by the roadside.

It’s unclear how many crashes involve Full Self-Driving technology, and if any of those crashes have led to death or injury. Tesla’s onboard computers are capable of communicating that information over the air to Tesla, but the company doesn’t share that data with the public.

Recently, Musk claimed that Full Self-Driving had not been a factor in any Tesla crash, although at least eight crash reports submitted by Tesla owners to federal safety regulators indicate otherwise.

Tesla’s response to the DMV complaints, if any, has not yet been made public. Tesla has no media relations office. Musk did not respond to an invitation to tell Tesla's side of the story.

Video Transcript

DAVE BRIGGS: Speaking of EVs, the king of them, Elon Musk, a faucet of news this week. He talked about a mild, 18-month recession. He says we have seen peak inflation, which is good news.

But he also talked about the Cybertruck. You know I love the Cybertruck. Hinting that the prices might not be under $40,000 after all. What do we know?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, so basically, it came up in the call-- in the actual meeting yesterday, what's the future of the Cybertruck? And Elon confirmed, yes, we're going to make this truck. We're going to start producing in 2023, mid-2023 at the Giga Austin plant. But he said, a bit of bad news-- quote-unquote ""bad news,"" the specs and pricing will change.

Like you noted, Dave, he introduced the truck as a starting point of $39,000. He's saying that because of inflation and things that they couldn't have foreseen, they cannot meet that actual price range. I'm not surprised, by-- the truck has been taking a long time to actually, as they say, industrialize and put into production. So not surprising they wouldn't start at $39,000.

The question is, how high will it go? How will that base model go? And where will that top end model go? I'm guessing over $100,000, but we'll see.

SEANA SMITH: And Pras, we also heard him reiterate his goal here to produce 20 million vehicles per year by 2030. What do you make of that? I mean, is that something that's attainable, do you think, at this point?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, he said at the end of this year, they want to be able to be at two million installed base by the end of 2022. So in 10 years, he wants to have-- [CHUCKLES] what's-- more than 50 times that, around 50 times that.

I wouldn't necessarily count him out, but it's gonna take a number of plants. And Elon said, that they'd like to have 12 plants around the world, you know, putting out cars. And if they can make around two million a year, that's only 24 million, right? So I'm not sure where you intend to get 100 million from.

Story continues

But he did tease at the next plant that's coming could be in Canada. He had already talked about how a plant would come in North America probably at the end of this year. That's their next plant, they announce. And some people are talking about Canada. And he said, yeah, Canada, I'm also half Canadian, how about that? Hahahaha. So it sounds like, at least for now, the short term, the Canadian-- north of the border for the next plant will be.

SEANA SMITH: And Pras, what about the latest when it comes to Twitter and the argument there? Obviously, he's in a legal battle here with Twitter whether or not he should be held responsible for the deal that he did make with the company earlier this year. How big of a worry do you see that being for Tesla shareholders, for Tesla investors in the second half of the year, while this battle continues?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, initially, I would have thought it was just a distraction for Elon, and something that he could actually shake off. But it sounds like Twitter is going all out here. They're not only subpoenaing people who work in the VC world that Elon's friends with, but also Tesla executives.

So I think as this expands, and if more Tesla proper gets sucked into this investigation, it could be a big headache for them. But as of right now, I think it's OK to say that the company will go on just fine with this going on in the background.

DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian, have a great weekend, my friend. Good to see you.",2022-08-05T20:17:29+00:00,2022-08-05

181,Inflation Reduction Act: What's in the (now Sinema approved) bill aimed at lowering costs for Americans,"It’s a deal set that is set to use hundreds of billion dollars over the coming decade to reshape the fight against climate change, how Obamacare works, the price of prescription drugs, and the U.S. tax code's treatment of big corporations.

Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) surprised the world on July 27 when they released their sweeping bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Then on August 4, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) propelled the deal closer to the finish line when she announced she would support the bill after of course making a few tweaks.

The so-called IRA — which still has plenty of hurdles to overcome before it becomes law — is a far cry from some early Democratic ambitions but nonetheless marks a potentially giant win for Biden and Democrats just a few months before November's midterm elections.

The rapid turnaround on the bill has left Democrats celebrating and Republicans shell-shocked. On August 4, Biden said in a statement that Sinema's support was ""another critical step toward reducing inflation and the cost of living for America’s families.""

Republicans are expected to line up en masse against the proposal but it can pass with only the votes of all 50 Democratic senators because of the rule of reconciliation.

The bill has gained the support of figures like former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who notably predicted the Biden administration's post-pandemic stimulus efforts would stoke inflation. He reportedly helped shape this deal and said in a recent Yahoo Finance interview, ""I think that the total effects of this bill could very likely be positive.""

Here's what the IRA will do:

About $390 billion for climate change and energy efforts

The centerpiece of the bill is a giant allocation toward climate change and energy efforts. Schumer has noted repeatedly that this bill “will be the largest action on climate change ever passed by the Congress.”

If enacted, it will spread money all around the green economy, from $9 billion toward a program to retrofit homes to $20 billion to manufacture more electric vehicles. Automakers like GM (GM), Tesla (TSLA), and Toyota (TM) are expected to benefit from the money as well as the expansion of a $7,500 EV tax credit included in the deal.

Story continues

Approximately $385 billion in total will fund clean manufacturing, agriculture efforts, and other sectors.

Advocates for the package say it will reduce U.S. carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030. The news has climate activists, who had largely given up on the chances of action from Washington D.C. this year, ecstatic. As one example, Evergreen Action Executive Director Jamal Raad said in a statement that the bill could “mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, reduce energy costs for working families, and save countless lives.”

The bill also has provisions that would impact the energy industry more widely, including new rules around federal land sales that may lead to oil drilling and a fund to permanently extend the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. That will help many former coal miners in Manchin’s home state of West Virginia. In total, the bill has many provisions that even the oil industry has gotten behind.

Late in the process, according to multiple news reports, Sinema secured an additional $5 billion in the bill to combat droughts around the country. The provision will be welcomed in her home state of Arizona and others in the Southwest that are suffering a drought that, by one measure, is the worst in 12 centuries. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV). and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) on Capitol Hill in Nov. 2021. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)

Changes to the health care system

The bill also makes significant changes to the health care system. One key provision will allow Medicare to negotiate for prescription drug prices. Current law prohibits Medicare from intervening in the talks between drug makers and health plan sponsors. The new rules would allow the government to weigh in to push down prices and save consumers — and the government — billions.

The bill also would add an inflation cap on drug prices to stabilize monthly costs and cap out-of-pocket drug expenses through new rules on rebates. All told, budget experts expect the combined changes will bring $320 billion into the U.S. Treasury in the coming decade.

The IRA also extends subsidies for health insurance costs that began in the 2010 Affordable Care Act for an additional three years. That provision comes with a price tag of about $64 billion. The subsidies had previously been extended in the American Rescue Plan and are currently set to expire this fall. If the bill doesn't pass, millions of Americans could see price increases in the fall.

Over $300 billion for the deficit

A cherry on top for advocates of the package is that the bill will reduce the deficit by over $300 billion over the coming decade through a series of “pay fors” (more on that below).

Manchin made deficit reduction a must-have portion of the bill to earn his support and noted “it is past time for America to begin paying down our $30 trillion national debt” in announcing his support for the deal.

Questions have been raised about the actual inflation-fighting powers of the bill, most notably in the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Their first estimate of the bill and found little inflation impact. It “would very slightly increase inflation until 2024 and decrease inflation thereafter,"" it stated.

During his conversation with Yahoo Finance, Summers cited deficit reduction as the key reason he expects the bill will reduce inflation and push back hard on the Wharton analysis, saying it ""takes no account of lower prescription drug prices [and] takes no account of increased energy supply"" but, even then, he noted ""the Wharton analysis acknowledges that this legislation is doing great things for the environment, great things for health access, great things for fairness, without contributing to inflation.""

Other estimates have found slightly higher inflation impacts, leading to partisan sniping on the issue and whether the bill is misnamed.

New taxes to pay for it

To pay for it all, in addition to health care savings, the bill makes three changes to the tax code.

There is a new minimum corporate tax that would apply to corporations that have made over $1 billion in book profits in recent years. That idea was initially projected to raise $313 billion, but a change from Sinema around rules about depreciation that manufacturers had loudly complained about is expected to lower the returns by about $40 billion.

The deal also will put aside billions to help the IRS chase down tax dodgers.

Finally, the deal would reportedly add a new 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. That provision, another late addition to gain Sinema's support, will reportedly bring in $73 billion to the U.S. Treasury. Removed from the deal was a plan to lessen the so-called “carried interest loophole,” which wealthy money managers can use to pay lower taxes on their capital gains.

Some figures, including the investor Kevin O'Leary, contend that things like the new minimum corporate tax could make the U.S. less competitive. “That’s not a good move because you want to keep our economy competitive,"" he told Yahoo Finance,

But from the perspective of Democrats in Washington, the overall tax effort will ""begin to restore fairness to the tax code,"" as Biden put it recently.

He and others note that the minimum tax would target the biggest companies in America, including the 55 members of the Fortune 500 that paid no federal income tax in 2020.

182,Tesla sets Aug 25 as trading day for three-for-one split shares,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday trading in its three-for-one split shares will start on Aug. 25, after the electric vehicle maker's shareholders approved the proposal during its annual meeting.

Shareholders of the EV maker voted for board recommendations on most issues at the company's annual meeting on Thursday, including re-electing directors, approving a stock split, while rejecting proposals focused on environment and governance.

Chief Executive Elon Musk owns 15.6% of Tesla, according to Refinitiv data, after selling millions of shares last year.

Each stockholder of record on Aug. 17 will get a dividend of two additional shares for each share held, to be distributed after close of trading on Aug. 24, the company said.

The new share split comes two years after a five-for-one split helped bring down the price of the high-flying stock within the reach of ordinary investors.

While a split does not affect a company's fundamentals, it could buoy the share price by making it easier for a wider range of investors to own the stock.

Tesla shares, which debuted at $17 apiece in 2010, rose to more than $1,200 late year after the 2020 stock split, taking the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion.

Tesla shares, which ended 6.6% lower on Friday, are down about 18% this year.

At the Thursday meeting, shareholders narrowly approved an advisory proposal that would increase investors' ability to nominate directors, with 339.2 million votes for the proposal and nearly 319 million votes against it.

Shareholder proposal asking Tesla to report its efforts in preventing racial discrimination and sexual harassment annually was rejected, with 350.7 million votes against it versus 310 million votes for the proposal.

The parents claimed Jones defamed them by claiming they were actors who had never really lost their children in a mass shooting. Depp claimed Heard defamed him by writing a column accusing him of domestic abuse.

Jones’s trial wasn’t actually about whether he defamed the parents or not. He didn’t respond to a number of court filings so he’d already lost by default, and the jury was just deciding how much to make him pay. But if he had contested the claim at trial, he would might have tried to argue he was exercising his free-speech or free-press rights. Opinions, even wild or ill-informed ones, are largely protected by the First Amendment, but wrong or misleading factual statements can be defamatory.

The Supreme Court’s 1964 ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan established the so-called “actual malice” standard for defamation cases by public figures against media outlets: the plaintiff must show the outlet knew a story was false when it published it or recklessly disregarded the possibility that it was false. That’s a tough standard that’s made it very hard to sue the media in the US.

Here are a few recent cases that illustrate the arguments parties put forth in big defamation cases and how they can turn out:Palin v. New York Times Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin sued the Times over a 2017 opinion piece that incorrectly suggested a map published by her political action committee helped incite a 2011 mass shooting in Tuscon, Arizona, in which six people were killed and 14 wounded, including then-US Representative Gabrielle Giffords. The Times corrected the piece within a day and claimed it was an “honest mistake,” but Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, accused the paper of deliberately or recklessly inserting the falsehood to harm her reputation. While the jury was deliberating, the judge announced he was going to dismiss the case because Palin had failed to present evidence that the newspaper’s conduct met the Sullivan standard. Palin is appealing the ruling and has suggested the case could be a vehicle for overturning Sullivan. Some conservative judges and commentators have said they believe that legal protection has fostered liberal bias in the media, and Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have said it’s time to reexamine the standard and possibly make it easier to sue the press.

Dominion Voting Systems Inc. v. Fox NewsSupposedly liberal media outlets aren’t the only ones claiming protection from defamation claims. Fox News is facing a $1.6 billion suit by Dominion Voting Systems filed for broadcasting false claims by allies of then-President Donald Trump that the company’s voting machines were rigged to flip votes for him to Joe Biden. The conservative network claims it was merely reporting the news by interviewing those making the claims, like former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who are also being sued for defamation. Dominion has highlighted evidence suggesting Fox knew the claims were false — including an alleged phone call by Rupert Murdoch a few days after the election in which the Fox Corp. chairman told Trump he had lost. Dominion also recently subpoenaed former Attorney General Bill Barr, who publicly pushed back on Trump’s election fraud claims. In its suit, Dominion suggested Barr’s statements put Fox on notice that the fraud claims were false.

Unsworth v. MuskAmong the more notable times Elon Musk got into trouble on Twitter was his exchange with British cave diver Vernon Unsworth, who participated in the rescue of a youth soccer team that became trapped in cave by floodwaters. Unsworth sued Musk for defamation, seeking $190 million damages, after the billionaire called him a “pedo guy” in a tweet. The tweet had been in response to Unsworth’s criticism of Musk’s proposal to rescue the team using a miniature submarine. After the children were rescued without Musk’s help, Unsworth said on CNN that the Tesla chairman’s proposal was a “PR stunt” and suggested he “stick his submarine where it hurts.” Though Unsworth testified that he felt he had been “branded as a pedophile,” the jury sided with Musk in finding that the insult wasn’t intended to be taken seriously.

Beef Products Inc. v. ABC NewsSouth Dakota-based meat processor Beef Products Inc. sued ABC News in 2012 over news reports that described their “finely textured beef product” as “pink slime.” Beef Products claims the reports led customers to mistakenly believed the product wasn’t meat and wasn’t safe to eat, and sales plummeted from about 5 million pounds per week to less than 2 million pounds after grocery chains around the country said they’d stop carrying products that contained it. Beef Products sought $1.9 billion in damages, but that amount might’ve tripled under a South Dakota law against disparaging agricultural products. The suit went to trial in June 2017, but the Walt Disney Co., the parent company of ABC News, announced it had agreed to pay $177 million to settle the case before the jury rendered a verdict.Carroll v. TrumpNew York advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, said in a 2019 article that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s in a Manhattan department store dressing room. The then-president subsequently told reporters that Carroll’s account wasn’t true and she wasn’t his “type.” Carroll responded by suing him for defamation for calling her a liar. Trump’s lawyers have advanced a series of arguments to stall or dismiss her suit, the most intriguing of which has been the claim that his statements about Carroll fell within his official duties as president and are therefore immune from civil suits. Trump got some surprise backing for this position when President Biden’s Justice Department took up the previous administration’s attempt to end Carroll’s suit. Though Trump’s remarks were “crude and disrespectful,” the Justice Department said in a court filing last June, “speaking to the public and the press on matters of public concern are undoubtedly part of an elected official’s job.” The trial judge rejected that argument but it’s now under appeal.

186,"California regulator claims Tesla falsely advertised Autopilot, Full Self-Driving","By David Shepardson and Jonathan Stempel

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc, the electric car company run by billionaire Elon Musk, has been accused by a California state transportation regulator of falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features as providing autonomous vehicle control.

In complaints filed with the state Office of Administrative Hearings, California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) said Tesla misled prospective customers with advertising that overstated how well its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) worked.

Tesla ""made or disseminated statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts,"" the DMV said in complaints dated July 28 and which it made public on Friday.

Vehicles equipped with Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technology ""could not at the time of those advertisements, and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles,"" the DMV added.

The DMV is seeking remedies that could include suspending Tesla's license to sell vehicles in California and requiring the company to make restitution to drivers.

Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

The Los Angeles Times earlier reported the DMV complaints.

Tesla has said Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" while Full-Self Driving also enables vehicles to obey traffic signals and make lane changes.

According to Tesla's website, both technologies ""require active driver supervision,"" with a ""fully attentive"" driver whose hands are on the wheel, ""and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

But the DMV said Tesla's disclaimer ""contradicts the original untrue or misleading labels and claims, which is misleading, and does not cure the violation.""

California is Tesla's largest U.S. market. The company sold 121,000 vehicles there in 2021, out of an estimated 352,000 sold nationwide.

Story continues

Since 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened 38 special investigations of crashes involving Tesla vehicles where ADAS systems were suspected of being used. Nineteen deaths were reported from those crashes, including a motorcyclist killed last month in Utah.

NHTSA had no immediate comment on the DMV complaints.

National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy in a Reuters interview last year said ""there is zero comparison” between Tesla's Autopilot and the tool used in aviation.

""Some manufacturers are going to do what they want to do to sell a car and it's up the government to rein that in,"" she said.

Here’s 3 stocks she likes right now,"‘We are in a recession’: Long-time bull Cathie Wood is warning investors about the ‘big problem’ in today's economy. Here’s 3 stocks she likes right now

Real GDP in the U.S. declined at an annual rate of 0.9% in Q2 – and that’s after a 1.6% drop in Q1.

While politicians refuse to use the “R” word, plenty of experts – including Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood – are calling for a recession.

In fact, she made the call even before the official data came out.

“We think we are in a recession,” Wood said in a recent CNBC interview. “We think a big problem out there is inventories — the increase of which I’ve never seen this large in my career. I’ve been around for 45 years.”

Based on how markets are doing, sentiment is certainly bearish. The S&P 500 is down 14% year to date. Wood’s flagship fund Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) tumbled by 49% during the same period.

But investors are not giving up. CNBC noted Fact Set data showing that ARKK saw over $180 million in inflows in June.

“I think the inflows are happening because our clients have been diversifying away from broad-based benchmarks like the Nasdaq 100,” says Wood. “We are dedicated completely to disruptive innovation. Innovation solves problems.”

For those who share Wood’s vision, here’s a look at the top three holdings at ARKK.

Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla has long been a staple for growth investors. But now, it’s also a name worth considering for contrarian investors – given how much the stock has pulled back.

Since reaching a closing high of $1,229.91 on Nov. 4, the stock has fallen by 27%.

But business remains on the right track. In Q2, deliveries of the Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y totaled 254,695 vehicles, up 27% year over year.

Ark Invest also sees a gaming-changing product coming for the company — robotaxi.

Story continues

“Tesla’s prospective robotaxi business line is a key driver, contributing 60% of expected value and more than half of expected EBITDA in 2026,” wrote Ark analyst Tasha Keeney in a report in April.

In that report, Ark expects a share price of $4,600 for Tesla by 2026. That represents a potential upside of over 400% from where the stock sits today.

So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Tesla is the largest holding at ARKK with a 9.3% weight.

Zoom Video Communications (ZM)

When meetings and classes moved online due to the pandemic, Zoom’s business flourished.

But as the economy reopened and employees started going back to the office, there have been concerns about the growth potential of this video communications company.

Year to date, Zoom shares have fallen 41%.

But Wood continues to see opportunity in the stock. In fact, Zoom is currently the second-largest holding at ARKK, accounting for 8.5% of the fund’s weight.

In June, Ark Invest released a research report showing how Zoom shares could see a glorious revival in the not-too-distant future.

“According to ARK’s open-source research and model, Zoom’s share price could approach $1,500, compounding at a 76% annual growth rate, in 2026,” Wood’s team wrote.

Since Zoom shares trade at around $109 a piece right now, that price target implies a potential upside of over 1,200%.

Roku (ROKU)

The secular trend of on-demand video streaming has created several winners in the tech space.

Roku is one of them. Since going public in September 2017, the stock has returned more than 200%.

The company’s platform gives users access to streaming services such as Youtube, Netflix, and Disney+. Roku also offers its own ad-supported channels featuring licensed third-party content.

The company added 1.8 million active accounts in Q2, bringing its total active accounts to 63.1 million. Revenue rose 18% year over year to $764 million.

Although Roku’s business is growing, investors have been bailing in rapid fashion. The stock is down a staggering 80% over the past 12 months.

But Ark Invest is not giving up on Roku. In fact, Roku remains the third-largest holding at ARKK, accounting for 7.1% of the fund’s weight.

The provision, opposed by major automakers such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co., includes prohibitions on batteries and critical minerals that are processed in China and other “foreign entities of concern,” which could render the consumer credit largely useless for years to come.

Those stipulations, and other limits on who qualifies for the $7,500 per-vehicle tax credit, were key to gaining the support of Senator Joe Manchin, who has railed against the incentive for months and even dismissed it as ludicrous. Manchin’s support for the overall package is necessary in the 50-50 Senate, in the face of united Republican opposition.

At the behest of Manchin, the legislation would also impose new limits on vehicle price and buyers’ income seen as restricting its use.

The legislation, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, which Senate leaders plan to bring to the floor as soon as today, lifted a 200,000-vehicle per manufacturer cap in a win for automakers such as Tesla Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp., who have reached that limit.

Under Senate rules governing the fast-track budget procedure Democrats are using to advance their climate spending and tax bill policy, provisions that are found to be incidental or extraneous to the federal budget can be challenged. Those that do not must be removed or modified.

A move in the bill to tie the value of clean energy tax credits to criteria such as paying workers prevailing wages had been seen as ripe for a “Byrd Rule” challenge as well, but they also survived, Ashley Schapitl, a spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee spokesman, said.

“We’re moving forward on the clean energy tax package with no Byrd Rule changes,” Schapitl said.

In 2021, electric vehicle (EV) sales doubled from the preceding year to reach a new high of 6.6 million. In 2021, the market share for electric vehicles was 4x what it was in 2019 and there are now over 16.5 million electric vehicles on the road worldwide, which is 3x more than there were in 2018. With 2 million electric vehicles sold in the first quarter of 2022, a 75% increase from the same time in 2021, the market for electric vehicles continues to grow rapidly.

Legacy automakers like Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) are diverting significant resources towards developing new EVs. Meanwhile, established startups like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF) are spearheading the industry. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the biggest auto company in the world in terms of market capitalization.

Analysts anticipate EV sales to account for 48% of new vehicle sales by 2030. Their contribution stood at just 5% as of 2020. Meanwhile, the number of EV charging points stands at 115,000 currently, a figure which is expected to balloon to 120 million by the end of this decade. To help with infrastructure problems, many governments around the world are introducing incentives for building EV chargers. The Biden administration has a plan to build 500,000 public EV charging stations in the U.S by 2030. In Japan, the government declared a target of 150,000 public charging outlets by 2030. Similarly, by 2025, the government of China has set a target to construct enough EV charging stations in the country to power 2 million vehicles.

Global Electric Passenger Vehicle Model Shipments Tracker data shows that EV shipments increased 79% year-over-year during the first quarter of 2022 to reach 1.95 million units. Battery electric cars (BEVs) made up 73% of those units, with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) making up the remainder. In terms of EV shipments, China continued to lead the industry, with Europe and the U.S following as the next two biggest markets. From a mere 0.5 million units in Q1 2021, China’s EV shipments climbed by 126% year-over-year in Q1 2022 to more than 1.14 million units.

197,Here’s What’s in the Senate’s Tax and Energy Bill,"(Bloomberg) -- The Senate passed Democrats’ landmark tax, climate and health-care bill, setting up the legislation for House approval and President Joe Biden’s signature.

After more than a year of stop-and-start negotiations, Democrats on Sunday agreed to a narrow bill to invest in energy initiatives, curb drug prices and reduce the deficit, paid for by new corporate taxes. The legislation is far from the roughly $4 trillion to reshape the American economy that Biden first envisioned when taking office, but the bill still gives Democrats something to show voters ahead of the November mid-term elections.

Here are the highlights of what’s in the deal:

Corporate Minimum Tax

The bill imposes a 15% minimum corporate levy on companies that have traditionally been able to pay little to no taxes because they were eligible for a long list of credits and deductions. This measure is known as the book tax, because it is applied to a company’s book, or financial-statement, earnings -- rather than the income calculation traditionally used for tax purposes. The private equity industry scored a last-minute win when several Democrats voted with Republicans to create a carveout that means fewer companies owned by investment firms will have to pay the tax. The regular, 21% corporate rate is left untouched, maintaining a key part of former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law.

Stock Buyback Tax

The legislation includes a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases set to go into effect at the start of next year. The legislation could cause some companies to opt for issuing dividends over buybacks in 2023, but until then there could be a flurry of share repurchases.

Story continues

IRS Enforcement

The Internal Revenue Service would get $80 billion to add auditors, improve customer service and modernize technology. Democrats hope to pull in $204 billion in tax revenue from cracking down on tax cheats and increasing compliance by rebuilding the IRS. The agency has lost staff and expertise over the past decade because of budget cuts.

Electric Car Credits

The bill includes $4,000 tax credits for lower- and middle-income buyers to use to purchase used electric vehicles, and up to $7,500 tax credit for new vehicles. The inclusion is a win for EV makers including Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Co.

Renewable Energy Credits

The plan has $60 billion in incentives to bring clean energy manufacturing into the US. These include production tax credits to accelerate US manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals processing. The plan also includes investment tax credits to build clean technology manufacturing plants that make EVs, turbines and other products.

Consumer Energy Perks

There would be tax credits for consumers who add renewable energy items to their homes, under the legislation, including efficient heat pumps, rooftop solar, electric HVAC and water heaters. The plan also includes $9 billion for home energy rebate programs for low-income consumers to make their homes more energy efficient and $1 billion in grants for affordable housing energy upgrades.

Drug Prices

The bill would direct the government to negotiate with drugmakers for lower prices on certain medicines, and cap what seniors on Medicare pay for drugs each year at $2,000. The measure also requires pharmaceutical companies to rebate Medicare if they raise the prices of their drugs more than just account for inflation.

Obamacare Premiums

The bill would also extend to 2025 an expansion in Affordable Care Act premium subsidies that’s currently set to end in January 2023. This will lower prices for millions of Americans.

Drought and Water Security

The Senate added, at the request of Senator Kyrsten Sinema, $4 billion for drought relief to help Western states facing historically low water levels. The funding would be used to buy private water rights and help municipalities with conservation projects to increase the level of water in the Colorado River system

The tax and energy bill passed Sunday after a year and half of rocky negotiations that divided the party. It gives Democrats tangible progress on key issues to show voters in the midterm elections this November.

Biden’s popularity nose-dived a year ago in the wake of the haphazard Afghanistan pullout and rising inflation -- and a year of infighting among Democrats over the domestic agenda. That squabbling is in the past and Biden can say a cornerstone of his agenda will become law.

Schumer was slammed last year for failing to unite his caucus behind Biden’s Build Back Better plan. He managed to revive a slimmed version of the deal, navigate last-minute holdups and blindside Republicans hours after they gave up leverage by allowing a bipartisan semiconductor bill to pass.

Here’s who else comes out on top and who takes a hit from the landmark bill:

WINNERS:

The Wealthy

None of the billions of dollars in tax increases Democrats floated a year ago on high-earning Americans made it into the final version of the bill, including proposals to double the capital gains rate, increase taxes on inheritances and levy a surcharge on millionaires. Despite rhetoric from Democrats that they wanted the richest Americans to pay much more, there wasn’t consensus within the party to pass a bill that raises levies on the 1%.

Private Equity

Private equity fund managers were able to dodge a tax increase that Senator Joe Manchin wanted, but fellow moderate Democrat Senator Kyrsten Sinema insisted be taken out of the bill. Manchin had wanted to narrow a tax break known as carried interest, that allows fund managers to pay lower capital gains rates on their earnings. The private equity industry was able to gain an additional win shortly before the final passage of the bill when a handful of Democrats broke with their party to vote on a Republican amendment that created a carveout for private equity-owned companies in the corporate minimum tax.

Story continues

Manchin, Sinema

The entire contents of the bill were essentially cherry-picked by Manchin and then tweaked to fit Sinema’s preferences. The two moderates amassed huge leverage with their willingness to accept no bill at all -- and attacks from progressives -- rather than a bill with provisions they opposed. The pair were also able to score some direct benefits for their states as part of the negotiations: Manchin secured and agreement to permit the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Corp.’s Mountain Valley Pipeline, and Sinema was able to get $4 billion for drought relief in western states.

Electric Carmakers

The deal extends a popular $7,500 per vehicle consumer tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles, a win for EV makers like General Motors Co., Tesla Inc. and Toyota Motor Co. But to win the backing of Manchin, companies will have to comply with tough new battery and critical minerals sourcing requirements that could render the credits useless for years for many manufacturers. Not all manufacturers stand to benefit from the credit. New cars that cost more than $55,000 and $80,000 for pickups and SUVs won’t qualify for the credits.

Renewable Energy

Solar company Sunrun Inc., energy storage and software provider Stem Inc., and hydrogen and fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. stand to benefit from generous tax credits in the bill. Nuclear reactor operators such as Southern Co., Constellation Energy Corp., Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. and Energy Harbor Corp. also could see a boon from a $30 billion production tax credit for nuclear power providers.

Oil Companies

Oil and gas got a boost alongside newer energy sources. The bill, which could mandate more federal oil and gas lease sales and boosts an existing tax credit for carbon capture, won praise from companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. The legislation creates a new 10-year product tax credit for hydrogen production that rises to as much as $3 per kilogram depending on carbon intensity.

Medicare, Obamacare Enrollees

The final bill caps out-of-pocket costs for seniors’ prescription drugs at $2,000 a year and allows Medicare to negotiate the prices on 10 medications four years from now. The bill avoids a large January increase in Obamacare premiums for many middle income people by extending subsidies for three years.

Deficit Hawks

Manchin negotiated $300 billion in deficit reduction into the bill, the first major effort by Congress in 11 years to reduce the difference between how much the country spends versus how much tax revenue it takes in. The deficit cuts are minor compared to the $24 trillion national debt but hawks say it’s a start.

The IRS

The Internal Revenue Service will get an influx of $80 billion over the next decade to expand its audit capability and upgrade technology systems after years of being underfunded.

LOSERS:

Republicans

The GOP was confident they had beaten back Biden’s tax and climate agenda and were stunned in late July when Schumer and Manchin announced a deal. While still the favorites to gain seats in the midterm elections, passage of the bill is a major setback for the GOP’s policy aims. It does, however, give them a new issue to campaign on in the fall campaigns.

Pharmaceutical Companies

The bill allows Medicare for the first time to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, a change that Congress has been discussing for decades with limited success, in part because of the drug lobby’s power. The pharmaceutical industry was able to score a partial victory after the Senate parliamentarian blocked a portion of the bill that would have capped price increases for drugs in the commercial market. Drug-makers will likely offset some of their reduced revenue from Medicare negotiations with higher prices for patients with private insurance.

Tech Companies

Technology companies are set to bear the brunt of the two major tax increases in the proposal -- a 15% minimum tax on financial statement profits and a new levy on stock buybacks. Corporations like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta Inc.’s Facebook have both been able to deftly use the tax code to cut down on the taxes they owe, while still being profitable. The minimum tax is designed to increase levies on companies that report large profits to shareholders, but can claim many deductions and credits to cut their IRS bills.

The SALT Caucus

The legislation does not include an expansion of the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, or SALT. The omission is a blow to residents of high-tax states in the Northeast and West Coast, and Representatives Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Tom Suozzi of New York, who led the effort to increase the size of the write-off.

Bernie Sanders

The $437 billion in spending is a far cry from the $6 trillion that progressives, led by Senator Bernie Sanders, envisioned at the start of Biden’s presidency. The bill excludes all proposals for new social programs, including child care, tuition-free college, housing spending and an expanded-child monthly child tax credit.

200,7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,"With many good stocks beaten down due to unwarranted worries about the Federal Reserve, now is an excellent time to identify stocks to buy and hold for many years.

Importantly, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently indicated that the central bank expects to only raise its key interest rate to about 3.5% at most this year.

Since the Fed’s benchmark rate after its July meeting is 2.25%-2.5%, that means it has only roughly one percentage point of hikes left this year. Many analysts previously thought that the Fed would close out the year with a target rate of around 4%-4.5%.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Now that the market realizes that the Fed is not really as hawkish on inflation as the bears thought, many stocks are likely to jump going forward. Consequently, I believe that August is a good time to buy and hold stocks.

Stocks to Buy and Hold: Best Buy (BBY) Image of Best Buy logo on storefront during daytime. retail stocks

Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) has a few attributes that make it a great pick for many decades to come. First of all, the company is the only widely known retailer that focuses primarily on consumer electronics. And the chain has become famous for the expertise of its salespeople. In an era in which many consumer electronics products are quite complicated and there are a multitude of choices, that reputation is quite valuable. That important competitive advantage should continue indefinitely.

Best Buy’s U.S. comparable sales sank 8.7% in the first quarter of 2022. But, as the firm’s CEO noted, the retailer is facing tough comparisons, as well as consumers’ pent-up demand for experiences. Of course, the latter trend has recently hurt most retailers.

Still, I expect the demand for experiences to dissipate later this year, boosting the financial results of many retailers, including Best Buy.

And with its 4.6% dividend yield, the stock is paying investors to wait for the latter reversal. Also importantly, the forward price-earnings ratio of BBY stock is now a very attractive 8.9.

One of the world’s leading solar module makers, JinkoSolar (NASDAQ:JKS) is benefiting from extremely strong demand for solar energy in Europe and China. Given the rock-solid commitment of both the European Union and Beijing to solar and Jinko’s advanced solar technology, the company should generate very strong profits for many decades.

During the company’s last earnings call, it stated that its powerful business in Europe would offset any challenges that it would encounter in the U.S. (And after President Joe Biden waived the tariffs on solar products from multiple Southeastern Asian countries, JinkoSolar’s problems in the U.S. decreased a great deal. That’s because the company has multiple factories in Southeast Asia).

Corroborating Jinko’s very rosy view on the European solar sector, Enphase (NASDAQ:ENPH) CEO Badri Kothandaraman stated that, “In Europe, the revenue increased 69% sequentially and 89% year-on-year led by strong demand for our microinverters in Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal.”

In China, the combined electrical power of newly installed solar systems jumped an incredible 137% in the first half of 2022, versus the same period a year earlier.

Also worth noting is that JinkoSolar has signed partnerships related to hydrogen and energy storage. Both of these deals can produce tremendous amounts of revenue for Jinko over the long term.

The forward price-earnings ratio of JKS stock is a rather low 15.9.

Stocks to Buy and Hold: EVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station

EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) is partnering with General Motors (NYSE:GM) to create “a coast-to-coast electric vehicle fast charging network.” Given the popularity of GM’s recently launched EVs, including the Hummer and the Cadillac Lyriq, along with the strength of the EV revolution, the deal leaves EVgo well-positioned to thrive for many decades.

Also very positive are EVgo’s partnerships with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Philadelphia and California. Those deals indicate, respectively, that the company is well-respected by corporate America and Democrats. As a result, the company is likely to obtain many more partnerships that will enable it to quickly grow its charging network.

Meanwhile, EVgo will probably benefit in the longer run from Washington’s commitment to develop a comprehensive, national EV charging network.

The $2.5 billion market capitalization of EVGO stock continues to greatly underestimate the company’s long-term potential.

Arrival (ARVL) An electric vehicle charger is seen next to a row of blue electric buses.

The EV maker’s alliances with two giants — United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) — both validate its products and leave it very well-positioned to excel over the long term.

Moreover, Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL) has recruited a management team with very strong backgrounds in the automotive space. For example, its president, Avinash Rugoobur was “the Head of Strategy and M&A for General Motors Cruise” from September 2017 to January 2019. He also “served in multiple engineering and management roles at General Motors, including approximately four years leading advanced technology activities in Silicon Valley.”

Also notable and encouraging is the EU’s decision to grant its certification to the Arrival Van. That news provided yet another validation of the automaker’s technology.

With the market capitalization of ARVL stock still near $1 billion, the market is greatly underestimating the company’s long-term potential.

Stocks to Buy and Hold: Goldman Sachs (GS) The Goldman Sachs logo is displayed on a smartphone in front of a multi-color background.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in good economic times and bad ones, seems to always generate strong financial results. Given its presence in most financial sectors, including M&A, trading and wealth management, it’s very well-positioned to benefit from the strength of the U.S. economy and of the American financial sector over the long term.

Goldman recently reported stronger-than-expected Q2 financial results, as its Q2 EPS came in at $7.73, versus analysts’ average outlook of $6.58. And showing confidence in its outlook, Goldman increased its dividend by 25%.

In the medium term, the bank should benefit from higher interest rates and the recovery of confidence in the U.S. economy. Also noteworthy is the idea that, as an important financial institution, Goldman, in all likelihood, will never be allowed to fail.

Plug Power (PLUG) Image of a man driving a forklift in a warehouse.

As I’ve pointed out in past columns, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has recruited some huge partners for its hydrogen-fuel business. Among these important allies are Walmart (NYSE:WMT), SK, Renault and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY).

Speaking of Airbus, I believe that, within a decade from now, Plug is likely to be selling a significant amount of hydrogen to airplane manufacturers and airlines. Such a development would provide a big boost to Plug Power and to PLUG stock.

Coming back to the present, the company recently reiterated its full-year revenue guidance of $900 million to $925 million. This indicates that its growth outlook remains on track.

Given the company’s strong growth and its tremendous potential, its forward price-revenue ratio of 7.5 is actually very attractive.

Stocks to Buy and Hold: Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) a line of AA batteries to represent battery stocks

In light of the ongoing EV revolution, the demand for batteries and lithium are insatiable, making the long-term outlook of the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT) compelling.

Finding a colorful way to explain the demand for lithium batteries, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk recently said that “Lithium Batteries Are the New Oil.”

Indeed, earlier this year, PBSreported that “Worldwide demand for lithium was about 350,000 tons (317,517 metric tons) in 2020, but industry estimates project demand will be up to six times greater by 2030.”

And with many automakers beginning to launch EVs, the mad scramble for EV batteries is only likely to intensify.

On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in PLUG, LIT, ARVL, JKS and EVGO. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.comPublishing Guidelines.

The vote on the bill was 51 Democrats in favor to 50 Republicans against, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote after an overnight marathon of votes on amendments. It now goes to the House, where the Democratic majority is expected to pass it on Friday.

Democrats called the bill the largest investment in fighting climate change ever made in the US, and it’s projected to help cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 40% from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. They applauded and hugged during the vote on final passage.

“I told my caucus all along, including the most pro environmental people, that we’re going to have to swallow some bad stuff to get good stuff,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote. “But my North star was always 40% reduction in the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere.”

The legislation also aims to prevent large corporations from exploiting tax breaks to pay little if any tax, and it would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time. It’s forecast to make the first substantial cut to budget deficits in more than 10 years.

Biden applauded Senate Democrats for pushing it through to passage.

“It required many compromises. Doing important things almost always does,” Biden said in a statement hailing the vote.

Republicans, united in opposition, argued it wouldn’t stop the historic levels of inflation and would impose taxes that could tip the US economy into recession.

Story continues

Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell argued that “hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes during a recession will kill jobs.”

The Senate vote was the culmination of a year and half of intra-party squabbling among Democrats about the scope of the bill, which Biden had once hoped would be so sweeping as to rival Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal. In the end it came down to two holdout moderate Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, whose votes were essential in the 50-50 Senate and who balked at both larger tax increases and more spending.

The deal that revived the bill was primarily hammered out on Capitol Hill, mainly between Schumer and Manchin, while an administration official Sunday said the president and top White House officials had been involved in keeping the effort alive behind the scenes, including regular contacts with Schumer and Manchin’s offices.

The legislation was passed through reconciliation, a Senate procedure that exempts certain tax and spending measures from a filibuster and requires only a simple majority to pass.

Trimmed from its original $6 trillion price tag to one of around $437 billion, the bill will nonetheless be a cornerstone achievement of Biden’s first term and one Democrats are eager to campaign on before the November midterms where they are fighting to retain control of Congress.

Key elements of the legislation:

Medicare would be allowed to negotiate drug prices, starting with 10 high-priced drugs by the middle of this decade and expanding from there. It would cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors enrolled in Part D at $2,000 per year. The Senate parliamentarian spared drugmakers any penalties for increasing prices in the commercial market. The savings to Medicare will be used to pay for three years of subsidized Obamacare premiums. The bill allows roughly $374 billion in climate and energy spending such as expanded tax credits for renewable energy projects. It ends per-manufacturer limits for the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, a boost for electric vehicle makers like Tesla Inc. But the vehicles will have to be built in North America and carmakers will have to quickly end a reliance on China for the battery supply chain. Some automakers like Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. lobbied to make changes to the credit. Government revenue will be raised from the establishment of a 15% corporate minimum tax on large firms, a 1% excise tax on the value of stock buybacks and an $80 billion boost to the Internal Revenue Service for enforcement. The minimum corporate tax would affect fewer than 150 companies in a given year. Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta Inc.’s Facebook could face the levy. Last-minute changes narrowed its scope in an effort to protect private equity, as well as businesses that invest heavily in equipment and facilities, such as manufacturers. The tax on stock buybacks has largely been shrugged off by Wall Street analysts, though some have noted it could spur corporations to issue dividends over repurchasing shares to juice equity prices. Apple Inc., JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Microsoft Corp. have relied on share repurchases as a strategy to boost stock prices in recent years.

The taxes increases are noteworthy for who isn’t affected. Democrats and Biden ran on reversing former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, including the corporate rate, which remain untouched. High-earners, including millionaires and billionaires, won’t face higher taxes, either.

Sinema demanded that the bill retain the carried interest tax break for private equity. That request irked many of her fellow Democrats who say there is little justification to provide tax benefits to highly paid investment managers.

The bill also doesn’t address two key priorities for many Democrats: implementing a 15% global minimum tax deal that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen negotiated with nearly 140 countries last year and increasing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, or SALT. With Democrats likely to lose a majority in at least one chamber of Congress next year, it’s unclear if either proposal can pass.

Still, Democrats indicated they were satisfied with the outcome. Schumer said the party has been talking about lowering drug prices and curbing climate change for years to little avail.

“This is America’s first real push to fight back in the climate crisis. This is the first time that we have just opened the door for Medicare to be able to negotiate with prescription drug companies,” Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren said after voting. “And this is the first time that we have said billion-dollar-plus corporations are going to have to pay a minimum tax. All three of those are historic.”

205,Indonesia says Tesla strikes $5 billion deal to buy nickel products - media,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker Tesla has signed contracts worth about $5 billion to buy materials for their batteries from nickel processing companies in Indonesia, a senior cabinet minister told CNBC Indonesia.

Southeast Asia's biggest economy has been trying to get Tesla to set up a production facility in the country, which has major nickel reserves. President Joko Widodo met with Tesla founder Elon Musk earlier this year to drum up investment.

""We are still in constant negotiation with Tesla ... but they have started buying two excellent products from Indonesia,"" Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan said in an interview broadcast on Monday.

He said Tesla signed a five-year contract with nickel processing companies operating out of Morowali in Sulawesi island. The nickel materials will be used in Tesla's lithium batteries.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.

Indonesia is keen to develop electric vehicles and batteries industries at home and had stopped exports of nickel ore to ensure supply for investors. The move had successfully attracted investments from Chinese steel giants and South Korean companies like LG and Hyundai.

However, most nickel investment so far have gone to production of crude metal such as nickel pig iron and ferronickel.

The government plans to impose export tax on these metals to boost revenue while encouraging more domestic production of higher-value products, a senior official told Reuters last week.

Blasts to dislodge precious-metal laced rock from the more than two-mile long Super Pit still frequently rattle the main street.

As about 2,700 executives, investment bankers and industry stalwarts gathered in the precious metals hub last week for Australia’s key annual mining forum it was clear where the industry’s focus lies. All attention is on the frantic hunt for battery metals to deliver the world’s shift to electric vehicles.

The most in-demand mining leaders are no longer those who’ve unearthed vast troves of glittering gold, but instead the companies delivering previously shunned projects to yield volumes of lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt.

A rush of recent supply deals led by Ford Motor Co. to add contracts for battery metals from Australian mining companies are drawing new attention to a nation that already provides about three-quarters of Tesla Inc.’s lithium needs, and is aiming to deliver a rapid expansion in the production of a whole suite of raw materials.

There are few better examples of that gold-to-electric-cars transition than IGO Ltd., which has added investments in nickel and lithium while selling off a stake in a underground gold operation. Executives shuttled conference delegates out to see Greenbushes, the largest hard rock lithium mine, and the Kwinana refinery that converts raw materials into specialist battery chemicals.

Hitting global net-zero goals will require a dramatic increase in renewable energy installations and in the adoption of electric vehicles, Peter Bradford, IGO’s managing director, told the conference. “To achieve it we are going to need lots and lots of metal,” he said. IGO and its partners aim to double production capacity at Greenbushes by 2027.

The mining sector’s largest company, Australia-based BHP Group, is also seizing on the outlook for rapidly increasing battery metal demand. BHP said on Monday it had made a takeover approach to add OZ Minerals Ltd., a producer of copper and nickel with mines in Australia and Brazil. Though the proposal has been rejected, analysts see the combination as compelling. OZ Minerals shares advanced 35% in Sydney trading Monday.

BHP forecasts electric models will account for 60% of new car sales by 2030, rising to 90% by 2040, said Jessica Farrell, asset president of the Nickel West unit, a once-unwanted collection of mines, smelters and refineries, including an operation in Kalgoorlie, that’s had its fortunes transformed by EV sector demand. The unit this month added a potential supply agreement with Ford to earlier pacts with Tesla and Toyota Motor Corp.

“We anticipate demand for nickel in the next 30 years will be 200% to 300% more than the previous 30 years,” Farrell told the conference.

Lithium producers remain the most in demand. Liontown Resources Ltd.’s executives used the conference to celebrate recent pacts with Tesla, Ford and LG Chem Ltd., while Core Lithium Ltd. — which also has a tentative deal with Elon Musk’s carmaker — told delegates its project in the Northern Territory is on track to deliver a first shipment before the end of the year.

Pilbara Minerals Ltd., which counts Great Wall Motor Co. and battery producer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. among its partners, this month received a record-equaling bid for its spodumene — a partly-processed form of lithium — at one of its regular auctions.

“What we’re seeing now is record breaking demand and prices,” Pilbara CEO Dale Henderson said in an interview at his company’s Pilgangoora site in a remote region in the north of Western Australia.

208,7 Growth Stocks With Multibagger Potential by 2025,"While the latest positive rumblings in the stock market are encouraging, it’s still not lost on investors that the S&P 500 is still down over 13% on a year-to-date basis. At the same time, opportunists can leverage this moment and position themselves in growth stocks with multibagger potential by 2025.

To be fair, no one can honestly predict every fluctuation in the market. That’s why you want to spread your bets as widely as possible. While some of these names could pan out, others could flounder. Therefore, the growth stocks with multibagger potential cover a wide variety of relevant industries.

Further, while no one enjoys watching their portfolio succumb to a sea of red ink, usually the best chance for generating significant gains is acquiring high-potential shares while they’re down, not while they’re up in the stratosphere. It’s silly to say, but you can turn that frown upside down with these growth stocks with multibagger potential by 2025.

Emblematic of the giveth-and-taketh-away dynamic of the new normal, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) soared following the spring doldrums of 2020. With its core digital payment processing business, PayPal was a benefactor of the global health crisis. People didn’t want to be near each other, but they still wanted to conduct commerce.

PayPal helped fill the gap, thus bolstering PYPL stock. Unfortunately, the sentiment didn’t last as long as management would have liked, with shares giving up most of their pandemic-fueled gains. Sure, PYPL has skyrocketed 30% over the trailing month, but even with this robust move, it’s down 50% YTD.

Nevertheless, PYPL is one of the growth stocks with multibagger potential by 2025. First, while competition concerns are problematic, PayPal is one of the top-ranked companies in the world. Second, the core business plays very well into the gig economy. Per data from Statista.com, the segment is expected to generate gross volume of $455.2 billion by 2023.

Thus, it’s possible that PYPL could move ahead of schedule.

WeWork (WE) Image of WeWork logo on the side of a glass building.

One of the more controversial companies to launch an initial public offering in recent memory, shared office space provider WeWork (NYSE:WE) was finally able to overcome the scandals and enter the public arena. Even so, the company couldn’t escape the troubles. Since the start of this year, WE stock finds itself down 45%. Near-term momentum provides little encouragement, with shares down a few basis points below breakeven on a trailing-month basis.

Still, there could be a glimmer of hope for WE being one of the growth stocks with multibagger potential by 2025. According to the Wall Street Journal, WeWork is attempting to boost its sagging share price by expanding into office software, specifically “selling apps, data tools and other software to landlords and office tenants trying to adjust to the new world of hybrid workplaces.”

What might end up being the saving grace for WeWork is a broader transition to hybrid work solutions if it can’t get a full return. Though remote operations helped many firms get through the pandemic, telecommuting has its own challenges and inefficiencies. Further, the New York Times reported that work from home interferes with developing new generations of corporate employees.

Multibagger Growth Stocks: Fiverr (FVRR) The Fiverr website displayed on a mobile phone screen.

Somewhat of a hedge against WeWork, Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR) presents an intriguing alternative. During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, FVRR stock was an undisputed winner, connecting companies with freelance workers. Unfortunately, the gradual acclimatization to Covid-19 and the steady return to normal has done a number on FVRR.

On a YTD basis, shares have plunged 65%, giving up a majority of its pandemic-fueled bonanza. Recent sessions don’t provide much optimism either.

However, FVRR may rise substantially over the long run because of the gig economy. With many employees not wanting to go back to the office, if push comes to shove, at least some will consider the freelance lifestyle.

As well, freelancing may be the future of work. For instance, the impact of globalization means that India may eventually be home to the biggest country for English speakers. Therefore, Fiverr can provide a platform for a job ecosystem that will likely become incredibly competitive.

While forward-thinking analysts love pounding the table and declaring that electric vehicles are the future, the burgeoning industry won’t advance much if charging infrastructure isn’t available. While 63% of occupied housing units have a garage or carport, that still leaves quite a few people without access to home charging. Therefore, Volta (NYSE:VLTA) may help fill the need.

Admittedly, though, the EV charging business is a tough one, being a victim of the classic chicken-or-egg dilemma. Long story short, EV manufacturers must pump out more vehicles to justify infrastructural investments, but they also need infrastructural investments to justify increased production. As well, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) agreeing to open up its Supercharger network to non-Tesla vehicles presents competition.

Therefore, VLTA is down 70% YTD. However, over the trailing month, it’s up almost 55%. Part of the reason could be its distinct business model, providing EV charging posts near major businesses where foot traffic is high. Combine that with an advertisement-driven ecosystem and VLTA could be one of the growth stocks with multibagger potential by 2025.

Multibagger Growth Stocks: NuScale Power (SMR) A hand in silhouette holds up a phone displaying the logo for Nuscale in front of a display showing the company's website.

Should the EV rollout prove successful, then another form of infrastructure – the power grid – must be ramped up to accommodate the power demand surge. While renewable solutions such as wind and solar certainly play their roles, their intermittent nature presents reliability issues. And that’s where nuclear energy comes into play.

According to the Office of Nuclear Energy, nuclear power has the highest capacity factor at 92.5%, far above any other power source. What this means is that it has minimal downtime needs, essentially always providing power when people need it. NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR), a specialist in small modular reactors, could easily be one of the growth stocks with multibagger potential by 2025.

Requiring a smaller physical footprint while presenting a safer operational profile than traditional nuclear powerplants, SMRs could be a gamechanger. In fact, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently certified its first SMR – and of course, that would be NuScale.

Plus, with energy resources becoming scarcer due to geopolitical tensions, the U.S. can no longer ignore the nuclear solution. But with NuScale, the solution just got a lot smarter (and smaller).

Although you don’t need to look far to find evidence of the devastation of the Covid-19 crisis, the worst impacts were focused on social interactions. While the pandemic was tough on everyone, it was especially difficult for singles, according to a report by the New York Times.

Further, just as people became acclimated to the crisis – and as government agencies loosened Covid-19 restrictions – another outbreak has sprouted, this time monkeypox. That doesn’t bode well for dating platform Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH).

However, at some point, even the monkeypox situation will fade. Further, the epidemiological challenges of the day present opportunities for MTCH being one of the growth stocks with multibagger potential by 2025.

With pent-up demand sparking phenomena such as retail revenge and revenge travel, it’s not out of the question for the singles scene to encounter its own version of this narrative.

While I’m a long-term supporter of cryptocurrencies, I acknowledge harsh realities. The most important in my opinion is that digital assets have their bullish and bearish cycles. Trying to fight the tape in either one will likely yield very painful results.

Therefore, I wouldn’t bet too heavily on cryptos nor on blockchain mining operations like Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT). Back when things were good in the underlying market, RIOT shares jumped from single-digit levels to near three digits. While it didn’t quite get to a Benjamin, the possibilities were certainly dancing in speculators’ heads. What will happen when cryptos rise again?

For right now, the costs of mining premium cryptos are too expensive and the rewards too small. Therefore, it’s quite possible that RIOT has some more market value to give up. But if you anticipate a resurgence in the sector, RIOT may be one of the speculative growth stocks with multibagger potential by 2025.

The push toward electric vehicles and incentives for buyers has brought the EV industry to the center stage. Electric cars will continue to gain popularity, and the demand for charging stations will increase in the years ahead.

To make the most of the current situation, investors should not only focus on EV stocks but also on EV charging stocks. This includes companies engaged in building charging stations, electric motors and batteries. Here are the top four most undervalued EV charging stocks to buy.

At the top of the list is Wallbox (NYSE:WBX). A very attractive EV charging stock with massive long-term potential, it is a smart EV charging and energy management provider that manufactures and distributes EV charging technologies. The company offers a range of charging solutions for commercial and residential use.

Wallbox is in the growth stage and has reported impressive revenue growth of 192% in the first quarter of this year. Its revenue stood at 28.3 million euros and it expects top-line growth in the range of 145% to 190%. It also achieved gross margins of over 40%, which is nothing but impressive.

What makes WBX attractive is the consistent expansion in global presence. The company has its products being sold in more than 100 countries and it is constantly expanding. Considering the massive addressable market, Wallbox has a long way to go and the growth trajectory will remain robust. WBX stock is down 40% over the year to date and is trading at $9.78 today, much lower than the 52-week high of $27.50. If the company manages to expand the product line, there is no looking back.

One cannot talk about EV charging without mentioning ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT). The company has the largest online network of EV stations and operates across 14 countries. It creates technology that is used to power the network and monitors and maintains the charging stations as part of its subscription-based product line. CHPT stock is trading at about $16 a share and has a market cap of $5 billion.

Interestingly, the company has recently signed an agreement to see the installation of hundreds of charging stations at condominiums and apartment complexes across California. It will bring close to $4.5 million for ChargePoint.

You can power your Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at a ChargePoint location if you have a Tesla adapter. The company allows you to power up your car wherever and whenever you go. Its fundamentals are impressive and the company managed to more than double revenue year over year to hit $81.6 million. With the high penetration of EVs in the country, there will be a rise in the demand for charging stations and this is where ChargePoint Holdings will make all the difference.

The company operates more than 30,000 charging ports and is steadily expanding. You can charge the batteries anywhere in the world at Blink Charging stations.

However, the fundamentals are proof that Blink Charging has a long way to go.

For the first quarter, it reported a revenue of $9.8 million, a whopping 339% rise year over year. The momentum will continue throughout 2022 and BLNK will be able to report stellar numbers again. There is more than one reason to bet your money on BLNK stock and the company’s massive growth potential is proof that you will not regret the decision.

EVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station

EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) is not as big as the other companies mentioned on this list but it is still worth watching.

EVgo has a network that is powered by renewable electricity through renewable energy certificates.

It reported first-quarter results in May and hit revenue of $7.7 million, an 86% rise year over year. The revenue is driven by fleet charging and retail charging. It already has plans to develop new EV charging stations across the U.S. in the coming years and the growth of the company is evident considering the popularity of EVs. It recently entered into an agreement to put charging stations at Pilot and Flying J travel centers.

EVGO stock is trading close to $9 today, significantly lower than the all-time high of $19.59, and is one of the most undervalued EV charging stocks to buy. Grab it while it is trading at a discount.

215,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know","Tesla (TSLA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this electric car maker have returned +14.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +8.3% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has gained 22.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post earnings of $2.74 per share, indicating a change of +47.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.7% over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $11.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +74.6%. This estimate has changed +4% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.44 indicates a change of +30.4% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +9.5%.

Story continues

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Tesla.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TSLA _12MonthEPSChartUrl

Revenue Growth Forecast

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +67%. For the current and next fiscal years, $85.14 billion and $120.2 billion estimates indicate +58.2% and +41.2% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Tesla reported revenues of $16.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +41.6%. EPS of $2.27 for the same period compares with $1.45 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.98%. The EPS surprise was +24.73%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Tesla is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Tesla Inc. shares charged ahead, rising as much as 5.3% and on pace to wipe off most of its losses from Friday, while smaller EV makers including Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. and Detroit-based traditional automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. also jumping higher.

Some of the strength in Tesla also came after news that it has struck a deal worth about $5 billion to secure nickel supplies from Indonesia over the next five years.

The Elon Musk-led company’s shares were the biggest contributors to the gains in the S&P 500 Index on Monday.

The climate bill extends a popular $7,500 per vehicle consumer tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles, though new cars that cost more than $55,000 for pickups and $80,000 for SUVs won’t qualify for these credits.

Renewable energy companies also stand to benefit from generous tax credits, sending shares of solar energy firms First Solar Inc., ReneSola Ltd. and SunRun Inc. higher. Meanwhile, hydrogen and fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. also advanced.

The clean energy sector has had a choppy ride over the past year. But it's been all bullish news in recent days.

On Sunday, the Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act. Considering that the $433 billion spending package – called the Inflation Reduction Act – consists of around $370 billion on climate and energy programs, it's no surprise that clean energy stocks are buzzing Monday.

Electric vehicle giants Tesla (TSLA), Rivian (RIVN), and Lucid Group (LCID) are all up about 5% in early trading. Meanwhile, ETFs that focus on the sector including the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN), SPDR Kensho Clean Power ETF (CNRG), and the iShares S&P Global Clean Energy Index ETF (ICLN) are all rallying nicely.

The bill also allows the Medicare programme for older and disabled Americans to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies for the first time. Pharmaceutical giants Pfizer (PFE), Sanofi (SNY), and Eli Lilly (LLY) are all down slightly.

Senators voted along party lines: all 50 Senate Democrats voted for the legislation while all 50 Republicans voted against it. Vice President Kamala Harris provided the tie-breaking vote.

This marks a big step forward for President Joe Biden’s environmental agenda.

Next, the bill will head to the house.

“The House will return and move swiftly to send this bill to the President’s desk — proudly building a healthier, cleaner, fairer future for all Americans,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Not smooth sailing, but could be a winning investment theme

Renewable energy stocks have garnered a lot of attention lately, but performance has been unstable.

In a 50-50 Senate with a united Republican opposition, the bill needed every Democratic Senator’s support to move forward.

So when reports came out on July 15 that Senator Joe Manchin would not be supporting his party’s economic package that includes new spending on climate measures, clean energy stocks – and particularly solar stocks – took a big hit: First Solar plunged 8.1%, Sunrun dropped 6.4%, Sunnova Energy International fell 5.0%, while SunPower was down 3.4%.

But in a surprising reversal, Manchin later announced that he reached an agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to vote on the climate spending package.

Manchin’s reversal sent solar stocks soaring, with First Solar, Sunrun, Sunnova Energy International and Sunpower all jumping over 10% on the news.

Although 2022 has been rather rough for stocks, these recent developments have brought many clean energy plays back from the dead.

Remember, you don’t need to pick individual winners and losers to get a piece of the action – ETFs can provide convenient and broad exposure. For instance, the Invesco Solar ETF is up 8% year to date and the SPDR S&P Kensho Clean Power ETF is up 4.9% during the same period – in stark contrast with the S&P 500’s double-digit loss in 2022.

223,Tesla (TSLA) Stock Split With Stock Dividend to Aid Share Price,"Tesla Inc. TSLA recently announced that the decision of its three-for-one split shares has been ratified by shareholders at the company’s annual meeting held on Aug 4. The stock split will be in the form of a stock dividend to ease out the ownership of employees and investors. Each stockholder of record on Aug 17 is entitled to a dividend of two additional shares of common stock for each then-held share to be distributed after the close of trading on Aug 24. Tesla’s stock will begin trading on Aug 25 on the new split-adjusted basis.

The recent announcement comes two years after a five-for-one split was announced in August 2020. During that time, the company’s stock was trading at nearly $1,300 a share, and the stock-split announcement sent the stock price bolting to a record high of $2,000 a share. After the split, the price per share was reset to around $460 and with a valuation of about $430 billion. The split resulted in immense growth in the stock, and the company got the scope to almost double its valuation over the next year. The split took its market capitalization above $1 trillion.

On the day of the recent announcement, the stock traded at $864 per share at market close.

Stock splits do not affect a company’s fundamental business model. Instead, they make high-end stocks more affordable to ordinary and small-scale investors, thereby diversifying and expanding the investor pool. The coveted Tesla stock has been in the cards of many retail investors, and the latest decision will provide them the access and usher in a set of new investors for the world’s largest auto giant.

Although Tesla is undoubtedly the reigning player in the EV space today, certain risks weighed on the company in early 2022. Supply-chain disruptions remain with the same intensity, and the company’s production in China was significantly affected by the resurgence of Covid-19-related restrictions. It is still not fully certain if the stock-split can be relied upon to provide an impetus to the company’s falling stock price, which is down 18% this year.

Shares of Tesla have jumped 21.1% over the past year, outperforming its industry’s 0.8% rise.

225,S&amp;P 500 Gives Up Gains as Nvidia Drags Down Tech,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 gave up gains Monday, following an Nvidia-led slump in tech after the chipmaker cut its guidance.

The S&P 500 fell 0.19%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, or 19 points, and the Nasdaq was down 0.23%.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell more than 8% after the chipmaker reported second-quarter revenue of $6.7 billion, well below its estimates of $8.1 billion, give or take 2%, as a challenging macroeconomic environment that is expected to continue in Q3 dented revenue in its gaming business.

“While bad news on the gaming front was anticipated, we see this result as somewhat worse than expected,” Wedbush said, forecasting Nvidia to deliver earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.52 a share in Q2, compared with a prior consensus of $1.26. The chipmaker reports quarterly results on Aug. 24.

The warning on performance from Nvidia weighed on sentiment in the broader chip sector, with Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) among the decliners.

Big tech, meanwhile, was mostly lower, though Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) bucked the trend rising more than 2%.

Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), meanwhile, slumped more than 13% after reporting an unexpected loss of 1 cent per share in the second quarter.

Energy was up more than 1% to stifle losses in the broader market after oil prices cut losses shrugging off ongoing recession fears and slowing China crude imports that point to softer demand.

Consumer discretionary stocks, up 1%, driven by a rise in Tesla and airline stocks.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) added 1% to also lift consumer stocks as sentiment on electric vehicles was boosted by the new climate bill, which was passed over the weekend in the Senate and includes nearly $400 billion over a 10-year period to fund climate and energy-related programs and an extension as well as improvement to existing EV tax credits.

In deal news, Global Blood Therapeutics (NASDAQ:GBT) rallied 4% after the blood disorder drugmaker accepted Pfizer’s $5.4 billion, or $68.50 per share in cash, takeover offer.

Signify Health (NYSE:SGFY) jumped more than 11% on reports that CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) is weighing a bid for the health services company, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources.

In other news, investor appetite for so-called meme stocks returned as Bed Bath&Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) surged.

Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) jumped more than 1% after Federal Aviation Administration said Monday that the aircraft maker is expected to resume deliveries of its Dreamliners in the coming days.

227,Stock Market Today: Dow Ekes Out Gain After Losing Steam on Nvidia Slide,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The Dow eked out a win Monday, after cutting the bulk of its intraday gains as Nvidia's profit warning kept tech stocks in the red.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, or 28 points, but was up more than 200 points at the highs of the session. The Nasdaq was down 0.10%, the S&P 500 fell 0.12%.

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell more than 6% after the chipmaker reported second-quarter revenue of $6.7 billion, well below its estimates of $8.1 billion, give or take 2%, as a challenging macroeconomic environment that is expected to continue in Q3 dented revenue in its gaming business.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) closed moderately higher as sentiment on electric vehicles was boosted by the new climate bill, which was passed over the weekend in the Senate and includes nearly $400 billion over a 10-year period to fund climate and energy-related programs and an extension as well as improvement to existing EV tax credits.

229,How top-selling electric vehicles will be affected by new tax credit,"In a big win for Democrats, Senate passage of the Inflation Adjustment Act brings the bill to the House, where the bill is expected to pass. If all goes as planned, the legislation could be in front of President Biden to sign in as little as a couple weeks.

For the automotive industry, a big piece of the legislation is the expansion of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs (electric vehicles), in which the cap on automakers to qualify for the credit — which currently is at 200,000 vehicles — will be removed.

While that sounds like good news for the automakers, several requirements have now been introduced that have the automakers claiming 70% of EVs and PHEVs (plug-in hybrid EV) will not qualify for the credit.

“There are 72 EV models currently available for purchase in the United States including battery, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell electric vehicles, says John Bozella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that counts General Motors, Toyota, and Ford as members in a statement. “Seventy percent of those EVs would immediately become ineligible when the bill passes and none would qualify for the full credit when additional sourcing requirements go into effect. Zero.”

These are the main requirements that will change and make the EV tax credits more restrictive:

Country of final assembly needs to be the U.S. MSRP needs to be below $55,000 for cars, and below $80,000 for trucks and SUVs Battery material sourcing must be sourced from U.S. or free-trade partners, with phase-in starting in 2024

The final component of battery sourcing, coming in less than two years time, means no EVs will qualify for the credit, according to Bozella. Note that these are just requirements on the automaker end; the bill adds income requirements on the consumer that will make many high-earning Americans and joint filers ineligible for the tax breaks.

The Automotive Alliance for Innovation lists all the zero emissions EV and PHEVs for sale in America here, along with a map and list of EV and battery manufacturers in America.

Story continues

Along with that information and quarterly sales reports, Yahoo Finance has verified how the following cars, the top 5 selling EVs and PHEVs in America, will fare under the new rules.

Tesla Model 3 and Model Y

Both U.S.-made Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs, the top selling EVs in America, would qualify for the tax credit following passage, a boost for the brand because Tesla is currently phased out of the tax credit. (Note: Tesla does not break out sales between Model 3 and Model Y, but registration data is used as a proxy.)

However, only the lowest trim Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive qualifies (MSRP $46,990). As for the Model Y, both trims qualify (Long Range - $65,990; Performance - $69,990) assuming the government classifies the Model Y as an SUV.

Ford Mustang Mach-E

Coming in second in sales last quarter for EVs and PHEVs was the Ford Mustang Mach-E, with 10,941 units sold. With a starting MSRP of $43,895, the base Mach-E could qualify as a car or SUV, however the Mach-E is assembled in Mexico so it would not qualify for the tax credit. This is a considerable drawback for Ford as the current tax credit no doubt drove sales of it over its most direct competitor, the Tesla Model Y.

Jeep Wrangler 4xE

The first plug-in hybrid on the list, the Wrangler 4xE, sold 10,861 units last quarter. With it most likely to be categorized as an SUV, and with a starting MSRP of $54,595, it would qualify for the tax break because the Wrangler is made at Jeep’s plant in Toledo, Ohio.

Hyundai IONIQ 5 and Kia EV6

The first non-US brand on the list, the all-electric Hyundai IONIQ 5, which sold 7,448 units in the second quarter, and its sister brand Kia’s EV6 EV sold 7,287 cars. Though the Korean automaker does build cars in the U.S. at a plant in Alabama, the IONIQ 5 and Kia EV 6 are built in South Korea so they would not qualify for the tax credit. This is a blow for Hyundai as the IONIQ 5 and EV6 has been praised by reviewers, and start at a very competitive $39,950 and $33,900 respectively, though the relatively cheap MSRPs may still make both viable options for many Americans despite loss of the credit.

Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV

GM’s lone entry on the list, the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV, sold 6,945 units last quarter. With a starting price of $25,600, it is the cheapest pure electric vehicle on the market, and with final assembly taking place at GM’s Orion plant in Michigan, the Bolt will continue to qualify for the federal tax credit.

Audi e-tron, Lucid, Polestart P2

Note that popular, sought-after models like the Audi e-tron (country of assembly), Lucid Air (price), Polestar P2 (country of assembly), and Porsche Taycan (price & country of assembly) that currently qualify for the federal tax credit, will not if the bill is signed into law.

All is not lost for manufacturers however, as it may be possible the incentives will no longer so important.

“By the time vehicle manufacturers can take full credit of the act, the market will be ready to accept electric vehicles and the incentives will no longer be necessary,” says Sam Fiorani, Vice President of Global Vehicle Forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions in a statement to Yahoo Finance. “With or without the incentives, the price to the buyer will not change substantially. Incentives like these prop up the price and provide extra profits for the manufacturer.”

Gianarikas raised his price target for Tesla's shares to $881, up from his previous price target of $815, and kept a buy rating on the stock today. The analyst believes that Tesla has a built-in advantage over other EV makers because of the company's lead in manufacturing, its ability to procure EV materials, as well as its autonomous vehicle technology, according to TheFly.com.",2022-08-08T18:11:53+00:00,2022-08-08

235,"Tesla Is Miles Ahead of the Competition, Says Analyst","If you really want to explore the inner workings of a car company, there can be no better way than to get on the factory floor. That’s just what Canaccord's George Gianarikas did when trying to see under the hood of Tesla (TSLA).

The analyst took a tour of the Fremont factory and was “mesmerized by the factory's chaotic symphony and employee morale.”

And given its limited size compared to the company’s other locations, Tesla’s ability to “push the boundaries” of what its first location can produce has left Gianarikas singing the EV leader’s praises.

“While macroeconomic factors and recent price increases can certainly impact order rates, we estimate Tesla’s EV momentum and competitive lead - from manufacturing, to materials procurement, to autonomy - is secured for some time,” the analyst further said. “With additional offerings in solar, energy storage, and more to come, Tesla remains the sustainability behemoth.”

Gianarikas had already previously argued that what sets Tesla apart from its tech peers and other auto OEMs is its “manufacturing proficiency.” Tesla is years ahead of its rivals with regards to “working out idiosyncrasies in building EVs versus ICE while managing a new supply chain reality.”

And Tesla keeps on pushing the envelope; last quarter, Fremont’s annual capacity was boosted from 600,000 to 650,000, which makes it the U.S.’s highest producing car manufacturing facility.

At the same time, the cost to produce a vehicle has gone in the opposite direction; since 2017, cost per vehicle made has dropped by ~57%. “Bear in mind that the cost of the battery pack has only declined marginally during that period,” notes the analyst, “making this improvement mostly a function of enhanced design and process.”

Furthermore, with the deployment of the robotaxi platform over the coming years, Gianarikas anticipates that manufacturing and process costs will come down even more.

You can also expect a much bigger production output in the years ahead. During last week’s shareholder meeting, CEO Elon Musk said he hopes to build between 10-12 factories with each facility boasting a production capacity of 1.5-2 million vehicles – amounting to around 20 million in total annual vehicle capacity. Expect a new site to be announced by the end of the year.

Story continues

All told, Gianarikas rates Tesla shares a Buy, while raising his price target from $815 to $881. (To watch Gianarikas’ track record, click here)

Overall, the Street’s take on Tesla presents something of a conundrum. The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 18 Buys, 6 Holds and 7 Sells. However, the $873.97 average price target implies shares will stay range bound for the foreseeable future. (See TSLA stock forecast on TipRanks)

236,Stocks search for direction after losing intraday gains,"Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith examines market movements heading into the day's final trading hour, especially the losses seen in the semiconductor industry, meme stocks, and the EV space.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: All right, Rachelle, let's kick things off here in the final hour of trading with a look at the markets because it's a reversal of how we started the day. You can see the major averages giving up most of the earlier gains. At least the Dow holding on to slight gains here, but the S&P now off just about a quarter of a percent. The NASDAQ off 3/10 of a percent.

I also want to pull up the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. It's interesting here to look at the losses today. That index off just about 2%. A lot of that weakness coming after the news that we got before the bell from Nvidia. Nvidia posting a huge miss here on revenue. We're seeing that reflected across a number of the semiconductors today. Nvidia leading to the downside here, off just about 8%.

Bucking the downward trend, let's take a look at some of the meme stocks. Bed, Bath & Beyond getting a lot of the attention this afternoon. GameStop and AMC two stocks that were actually halted in earlier trading, now up pretty big, up just over 8%. We didn't really get news on either, so it's interesting here to see some of the interest reignited in some of these popular meme plays.

And I also want to pull up some of the EV makers. Tesla up just about 1%. We're seeing some gains here. GM, Lucid, Rivian here among the leaders, as well as Ford. The news over the weekend, the Senate passing the climate and tax bill-- tax credits there-- in there for some of the electric vehicle makers. We're going to talk a little bit more about that later in the show, Dave. But we're seeing gains here from a number of the bigger players in the space.

243,Tesla's July sales of Chinese-made vehicles slide due to factory line upgrades,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Tesla sold 28,217 Chinese-made vehicles in July, nearly two-thirds less than a month earlier as a scheduled upgrade to its factory lines in Shanghai disrupted production.

The U.S. carmaker exported 19,756 Model 3s and Model Ys from China last month, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA)said. In June, it sold 78,906 vehicles and exported 968.

Tesla China usually exports more cars at the beginning of a quarter while focusing more on domestic sales at the end.

Tesla suspended most of its production at the Shanghai plant in July due to an upgrade that aims to bring the factory's weekly output to around 22,000 units compared with levels of around 17,000 in June, according to internal memos seen by Reuters.

The output ramp-up at Tesla's most productive manufacturing hub comes after production losses during a two-month COVID lockdown in Shanghai hurt the company's profit margin in the second quarter.

China's overall passenger car sales in July jumped 20.1% from a year earlier to 1.84 million, the CPCA said.

Sales of electric cars accounted for 26.4% of the total in July and increased 117.3%, it added, with sales of plug-in hybrids outpacing pure electric cars.

The association now expects electric car sales for the whole year could reach 6 million units, higher than an earlier estimate of 5.5 million.

BYD led the EV players with 163,042 cars delivered in July, with plug-in hybrids accounting for more than half of its sales.

Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto delivered 10,052, 11,524 and 10,422 vehicles, respectively.

Sales of conventional hybrid cars in July also increased 81% from a year ago, with Japan's Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd leading the segment.

250,"Meme stocks Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, AMC, and GameStop continue to move on little news","Whether it's a function of people deciding to stay home to trade stocks in the air conditioning or folks looking for a way to make extra money in an inflationary environment, the meme stock trade is having another moment.

The top 10 most actively trading stocks on Fidelity on Monday included AMC, Bed Bath & Beyond, and GameStop. Shares of AMC were the second most active on the platform behind the always volatile Tesla.

In pre-market trading on Tuesday, Bed Bath & Beyond stock spiked 10% following a nearly 40% gain on Monday. Bed Bath & Beyond spokesman Eric Mangan did not return Yahoo Finance's request for comment on the stock price movement.

Bed Bath & Beyond shares have exploded 131% so far in August.

The move — against a backdrop of speculation the struggling retailer is nearing a badly needed cash raise — generally has come out of nowhere.

A similar no-news push higher involves GameStop stock, which fluctuated pre-market on Tuesday following an 8.5% gain on Monday.

As for cinema chain AMC Entertainment, AMC stock rose nearly 3% in pre-market trading today in the wake of an 8% increase on Monday.

Unlike its peers in meme land, however, at least AMC shares had a positive catalyst.

AMC CEO Adam Aron —affectionately known as ""chief ape"" amongst the Reddit community — exclusively told Yahoo Finance Live the company would begin debt reduction ""soon.""

""We are going to get on a path relatively soon to deleverage some more,"" Aron said (video above). ""I think you can say relatively soon, meaning starting this year and certainly in significant numbers in 2023."" GameStop logo seen at one of their stores on Henry Street in Dublin.

Whatever the reason for the meme stock revival, fresh data underscore the investor appetite for the names that made the retail trading movement popular at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

More broadly, the Roundhill Solactive Meme Stock Index, which tracks popular meme stocks such as AMC, Roku, Peloton, and Robinhood is up a cool 15% in August.

US equity markets are in the green as of August 8 as we head towards the end of the earnings season. The following week will see data regarding inflation levels being published. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be reported on Wednesday, and investors are expecting a slight decline in the rate due to lower fuel prices in July. Analysts are expecting CPI to be posted at 8.7% for July as opposed to 9.1% a month earlier.

The S&P 500 Index has closed in the green for the past three consecutive weeks. Notable companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are amongst the stocks trending this week.

Let’s discuss why these stocks are trending this week and see how hedge funds are positioned in them.

10. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) has rocketed 40.07% this week. The New Jersey-based operator of bedding, bathroom, kitchen, and home décor retailers, is looking to close in the green for the tenth consecutive day.

Experts think that Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock is experiencing a short squeeze as the company’s short interest ratio increased to an 18-month high of 46.1% as of July 31. On August 5, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock gained 32% as 52.76 million shares exchanged hands without the presence of any significant news in the market. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) was one of the most mentioned stocks on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum on August 8.

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) was discussed in the Q2 2022 investor letter of Miller Value Partners. Here’s what the firm said about the company:

“Bed Bath & Beyond 5.165% 08/2044declined 67.4% in the period. Bed Bath & Beyond reported 4Q21 sales of $2.05 billion, down 22% Y/Y, missing consensus of $2.08 billion. The company lost $0.92 per share in the quarter, down from 4Q20 adjusted EPS of $0.40, below analyst expectations for EPS of $0.03. Management noted supply chain disruptions and the Omicron variant led to inventory availability challenges, which had an estimated sales impact of $175 million, or 8.5% of 4Q21 net sales, and a 400 basis points (bps) Y/Y contraction in 4Q21 adjusted gross margin to 28.8%, driven by product cost increases and higher than anticipated freight and shipping costs. Additional headwinds in the quarter included general weakness in the retail segment, highlighted by big earnings misses from Walmart and Target, along with Moody’s downgrading Bed Bath’s corporate family rating from B1 to B2. The ratings agency cited increased execution risk of the company’s strategic turnaround initiatives and ongoing supply chain issues weighing on the company’s market share and profitability going forward as the main drivers for the downgrade. However, Moody’s maintained a stable outlook for the retailer due to the financial flexibility provided by the company’s liquidity position and low level of funded debt.”

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) was held by 15 hedge funds at the end of Q1 2022.

9. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35

First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) has risen 9.98% this week after the Tempe, Arizona-based provider of photovoltaic (PV) solar solutions was upgraded from a Neutral to an Overweight rating by Mark Strouse at JPMorgan. The analyst also revised the price target on First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) from $83 to $126. Strouse highlighted the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as the biggest policy step in the history of the US in accelerating the transition from conventional to renewable sources of energy. The analyst thinks that First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) is in the best position to leverage the bill. Although there are chances that the bill may be amended when it is presented in the House of Representatives, it is highly unlikely that the salient features of the bill would be changed.

Beech Hill Partners was the leading hedge funds investor in First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) during Q2 2022.

8. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36

Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) has plummeted 14.07% this week after the Denver, Colorado-based data analytics entity reported mixed Q2 2022 results and provided weak guidance for FY22.

7. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45

Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) is up 3.91% this week after the Canadian miner reported better-than-expected results for Q2 2022.

Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) reported revenue and adjusted EPS of $2.86 billion and 24 cents, respectively, which outperformed the analysts’ forecast of $2.85 billion and 22 cents. The company also benefitted from higher copper production during the quarter. Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) anticipates meeting the annual guidance for copper and gold production. However, CEO Mark Bristow highlighted that the supply of copper would not be able to keep up with the increased demand for the metal as heavy metals are an integral part of clean energy initiatives.

Here’s what ClearBridge Investments said about Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“In addition to Iberdrola, new purchases among structural growers during the quarter included Canadian mining company Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), which is seeing operating improvements in its business. The company has aggressively delevered its balance sheet and reduced capex spending to a lower level, directing its healthy free cash flow to dividends and buybacks.’’

6. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders:46

Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has surged 9.26% this week after notable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin USD (CCC:BTC-USD) and Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) are rallying following a positive job report for July 2022. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained 4.4% and 6.1%, respectively.

Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) soared last week when BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) entered into a partnership with the company. The deal would allow BlackRock, Inc.’s (NYSE:BLK) institutional investors to buy and sell Bitcoins on the cryptocurrency exchange platform. Following this development, Carlton Lai at Daiwa gave Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock a Buy rating with a target price of $100 in a note issued to investors on August 8.

Rowan Street Capital LLC shared its stance on Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“The mentality of a passionate Founder/CEO drives a completely different thought process and decision-making that makes all the difference. This is a quote by Brian Armstrong, Founder and CEO of Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN):

‘I can speak with some authority and say we are not going to do that because this is not why I started the company – I don’t have to give any other justification. Rather than the professional CEO that comes in that is accountable to Wall Street and quarterly earnings may start thinking about the company differently. One of the most scarce things in companies today is risk tolerance. For example, take Tesla vs. Waymo. Tesla launched self-driving cars while Google didn’t. The reason is the founder-CEO (Elon Musk) said that I care enough about the mission that we are ready and we are gonna go for it. Whether a professional CEO is thinking about his/her career trajectory, the founder CEO doesn’t care about the next job and only cares about the mission.’""

In addition to Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), popular stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) are also trending this week.

Segmental Takeaways

Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM): Net sales of the segment jumped 14.4% year over year to $54.2 million in the reported quarter, mainly due to additional revenues from the acquired Stako sp. zo.o fuel storage business, increased light-duty OEM business sales volumes to OEMs in India and higher sales volume in electronic and hydrogen products. The segment reported an operating loss of $5.6 million, wider than the loss of $3.4 million incurred in the year-ago period. In the quarter, gross margin decreased to $4.7 million or 9% of revenues compared with $7.2 million or 15% of revenues in the year-ago quarter due to reduced sales volumes to the European OEM customers caused by higher relative CNG fuel prices.

Independent Aftermarket (IAM): Net sales of the segment totaled $25.7 million, down 18.6% from the year-ago period, primarily due to decreased sales volumes to Russian customers due to the Russia-Ukraine war, lower sales volumes to Argentina and Turkey and a fall in sales to Africa. In the quarter, the segment incurred an operating income of $0.08 million, plummeting from $1.1 million in second-quarter 2021. Gross margin in the quarter decreased to $5.8 million or 23% of revenues compared with $8.5 million or 27% of revenues in the year-ago period. The decrease was led by lower sales volumes and higher production input costs incurred in materials, transportation and utility costs brought by the global supply chain shortage and inflation.

Corporate Business Segment: In the reported quarter, operating loss for the segment amounted to $5.8 million, widening from the loss of $1.4 million reported in the year-earlier period.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

JULIE HYMAN: AMC shares are sliding today after jumping in yesterday's session and in Friday's session, for that matter. We had a chance to speak with the company's CEO Adam Aron yesterday and learned-- or I guess reemphasized that he does things a little bit differently than most CEOs, including targeting his earnings call to retail investors. This is what he told us about it.

ADAM ARON: When I learned, much to my amazement, that 10,000 people we're listening to our earnings call via webcast, 10,000 people-- back in the good old days when we were institutionally owned, we didn't have 100 people on our calls. Well, all of a sudden, we had 10,000 people on our calls. So it made sense to talk directly to our shareholders in a forum where they were listening.

JULIE HYMAN: And that's--

BRIAN SOZZI: That's where you find my take for today because I'm going to piggyback on Adam Aron because I agree with him on this situation. I think it's time just to overhaul earnings calls. Now, a company's not required to hold an earnings call. It's just a trend that developed over many years. They are helpful.

But still, I think they could be more helpful because, by and large right now, we have AMC essentially holding an earnings call that is retail focused and a lot friendlier than what we hear from most companies on Wall Street. So here are a couple of my suggestions to other companies that might want to change their earnings calls because they probably should because of the rise in the retail investor. First up here, my first change, no review of the quarter by executives.

JULIE HYMAN: Oh, gosh, that canned thing at the beginning?

BRIAN SOZZI: It is awful. This thing sucks up 30 to 45 minutes and mostly involves CEOs, CFOs, and sometimes COOs patting themselves on the back and just rehashing everything that's on the press release. Do not care. Keep it moving. And my next point here, every analyst question should be followed by a retail investor question.

Story continues

Now, provided that retail investor is actually confirmed to be an investor in the company, whether it's someone who likes the stock or someone who is betting against it, take that question right after the analyst because, to Aaron's point, what we didn't show there, he also made a very good point, most of these earnings calls are ridiculously boring and mostly involving analysts asking questions to improve their Excel modeling spreadsheet, and then they put out notes that most people, most human beings don't even understand what they're talking about.

And last but not least, the entire-- the entire executive team should hold an interactive chat the following day, either on Yahoo Finance, our various platform, YouTube or Twitch and get it full so investors, retail and institutional, get a sense of the entire team because I can't tell you how many times mistakes by the COO and all of his reports lead to big mistakes in earnings that the CEO and the CFO have to come out and justify. I want to see this whole team. I want to see their faces. I want to know what they're working on. If it's an over an hour, so be it, take questions, time to evolve.

JULIE HYMAN: The only thing I would say about this is-- and I think these are all good ideas to make this-- the whole process more understandable, but for the vast, vast majority of companies, the vast, vast majority of their investors are institutional investors. They're not individual people. So I don't know if this would be sort of a waste of time.

BRIAN SOZZI: Well, you make a very good point. Here's my take before-- because I know the team works very hard at the graphics for this. There I am in a Tesla stock going to an AMC movie. Why are AMC and Tesla the only ones showing they care about the retail investors?

And I see your point, Julia, you're right. I can't see GE coming out here, sleepy old GE with the CEO making tons and tons of money reinventing it's earnings call after decades of doing it one way. But still, even institutions should be paying attention to what retail investors are doing and give a damn about what they're doing with their trading account. It should matter, and it does matter.

BRAD SMITH: All right. The different type of retail investor that already has a little bit more insight into what the company is doing--

BRIAN SOZZI: Yes.

BRAD SMITH: --employees as well--

BRIAN SOZZI: Because they're using the products.

BRAD SMITH: Right.

BRIAN SOZZI: They're in this AMC theaters. I can't tell you-- as a former analyst, you could become very disconnected from what the company actually does. And you know, it's unfortunate.

BRAD SMITH: All right. Was that a Model 3 Tesla that you had there?

BRIAN SOZZI: I can confirm that, yes.

BRAD SMITH: All right.",2022-08-09T14:31:39+00:00,2022-08-09
261,"Leveraged Tesla, Coinbase Funds Among New Single-Stock ETFs","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. and Coinbase Global Inc. fans are about to get their first ETFs that amplify bets on the notoriously volatile companies, among a slew single-stock products hitting the market Tuesday.

Direxion and GraniteShares are each launching four exchange-traded funds that allow investors to make leveraged or inverse bets on the daily performance of individual companies. They’re both starting leveraged- and inverse-Tesla funds as well as leveraged Apple Inc. products. GraniteShares is also introducing a leveraged Coinbase ETF, while Direxion is debuting an inverse Apple fund.

The first single-stock products in the US launched last month even as regulators warned of their risks to investors and markets. Many of those ETFs from AXS Investments track retail favorites like Tesla, Nvidia Corp. and PayPal Holdings Inc. -- stocks that grew in popularity as small-time traders piled into the market during the pandemic but have since delivered steep losses during the downturn.

While AXS is a small issuer, the two firms launching Tuesday have made their names in complex products. Direxion is one of the largest providers of leveraged ETFs in the US, and GraniteShares offers many single-stock products in Europe.

With dozens of single-stock ETFs now filed in the US with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the two issuers are up against several competitors rushing into the space, lured by the opportunity to charge higher fees. Both, though, said their history of offering complex products will be a selling point to investors.

“Direxion has a large following of tactical traders, both retail and institutional,” David Mazza, head of product at the firm, said in an interview.

Story continues

Will Rhind, chief executive officer at GraniteShares, noted that “a lot of investors know us already in this space.”

The two firms’ inverse Tesla funds in particular will face off against AXS’s TSLA Bear Daily ETF (TSLQ) that launched last month. GraniteShares’ new products each carry a 1.15% expense ratio, the same as AXS’s products. Direxion’s ETFs each carry a management fee of 0.95%, according to Mazza.

In addition to the funds they’re introducing Tuesday, Direxion and GraniteShares have a combined total of 36 other funds on their drawing boards. Direxion chose to focus on Tesla and Apple in its first wave of launches because the companies have some of the most “controversial viewpoints” held by the trading community, meaning there are many people wanting to make bets on both sides of the stocks, Mazza said.

The trading activity on AXS’s ETFs is evidence of the popularity of Tesla-linked products. Out of the eight single-stock ETFs that AXS has launched, its inverse Tesla fund has received the most inflows and trading volume.

GraniteShares’ initial wave of launches includes its leveraged Coinbase ETF since the product would be the first in the US that comes closest to leveraged crypto exposure, Rhind said. The product is debuting as Coinbase is set to report earnings after the market close Tuesday.

Similar to AXS, the two issuers both initially planned for bull funds that would offer two times the daily return on single stocks, but have lowered the leverage amount for some of their ETFs while they were under review with the SEC. They made the changes to comply with rules that are meant to limit the amount of derivatives-related risk within a fund.

While the SEC has not blocked single-stock ETFs from listing, officials have issued a barrage of warnings about the products. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has cautioned investment advisors against recommending the ETFs to retail traders.

Mazza said Direxion has been educating retail traders about its complex products.

“We really emphasize through our educational efforts that these products are not to be used as long-term investments. In fact, quite the opposite -- these funds are daily trading tools,” he said.

Rhind at GraniteShares said a single-stock ETF is not for every investor.

“It’s a product for people that understand the risks, understand how leverage works, understand how daily rebalancing works and people that are able to monitor their portfolios actively,” he said.

(Updates with Coinbase due to report earnings in 11th paragraph. An earlier version corrected the ticker of the inverse Apple ETF in table.)

262,Elon Musk is doubling down with potentially strong fraud claims against Twitter,"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk raised the stakes in his court battle with Twitter (TWTR) on Friday, filing a counter lawsuit that accuses the social media company of fraud.

“He’s now really doubling down,” University of Iowa corporate and securities law professor Robert Miller says about Musk’s countersuit. “That’s a very strong claim, if true.”

In his countersuit made public on Friday, Musk’s lawyers detailed arguments first made in a July 8 letter to terminate Musk's agreement to acquire Twitter in a $44 billion merger. While legal scholars have noted weaknesses in those early arguments, Musk’s new fraud claims, if proven, could push Twitter into a more challenging defense.

In his new claims, Musk says Twitter defrauded him by minimizing the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on its platform in statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Twitter stands by its estimate that fake or spam accounts comprise fewer than 5% of its mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users, and notes that it reported to the SEC that the actual number could be higher.

Weeks after agreeing on April 25 to acquire Twitter’s outstanding stock at $54.20 per share, Musk posted on Twitter hinting of cold feet. Musk's termination letter followed, accusing Twitter of breaching the deal by withholding the methods it used in its public filings to estimate that less than 5% of its monetizable daily active users are fake accounts.

Twitter claims the bots issue is a pretext for backing out of the deal, and that Musk has torpedoed Twitter stock with a series of disparaging tweets. The social media site is suing to force Musk to go through with the deal.

Is the Botometer giving Musk accurate information?

To be sure, Miller says, Musk faces an uphill battle in his fight against Twitter. However, his fraud allegations could be strong, if proven, because they don't rely solely on the judge's interpretation of the heavily seller-friendly merger agreement. Instead, the judge must apply federal securities law that prohibits ""materially false"" statements — those that reasonable investors would likely view as significantly altering the total mix of information the company made available.

Story continues

To prevail on a fraud claim, Musk must either show that in regulatory filings between Jan. 1 and April 25, Twitter knowingly made a materially false statement, or that Twitter knew its methodology had major problems yet continued to rely on it.

For his part, Musk alleges that he tested a limited set of user account data shared by Twitter using Indiana University's publicly available bot detection tool, Botometer. Using the tool, Musk says, his team estimated that false or spam accounts comprise around 33% of accounts in the data set, and at least 10% of Twitter’s monetizable daily active users. Twitter account post from Tesla CEO Elon Musk's handle on July 6, 2022

It's unclear whether the Botometer can disprove Twitter's statements, Miller said. Musk has alleged in his counterclaim that Twitter is withholding data needed to independently verify its representations. Plus, it's not clear how much data, if any, the judge will demand that Twitter turn over to Musk. Even given access to Twitter's proprietary tools, independent verification could show that Twitter's estimates are within a legally acceptable range.

In its own court filing, Twitter characterizes Musk's Botometer estimates as output produced by ""running the wrong data through a generic web tool.""

REUTERS/Massimo Pinca

Twitter contends that its own estimate is different because it relies on private data. However, Indiana University computer scientist Kaicheng Yang, lead developer of the Botometer tool, says that Twitter may be able to turn over the information Musk is looking for without disclosing its own proprietary information or its users' personal data. He adds that Musk might also be able to elicit the truth without more disclosures from Twitter.

“I think there is a way to do that,” Yang said about Twitter’s ability to hand over more data to Musk while still protecting its account holders' private data. “Based on my understanding of what Elon Musk wants, it’s [to know] how Twitter did its analysis.”

Twitter further criticizes Botometer’s tool as one that identified Musk’s own Twitter account as a potential bot, and that targets a different set of accounts from those captured in Twitter’s SEC statements.

“Bot detection is a hard task,” the company said in its court document countering Musk’s claims. ""[I]f it were easy to do with software, there wouldn’t be any bots.”

Botometer’s machine learning model and its accuracy have been cited in peer-reviewed publications. However, as Yang explains, its algorithm is designed to detect social bot accounts and not spam accounts, though the two can overlap. In essence, he says, the tool distinguishes automated accounts from accounts run by humans.

In 2017, Botometer estimated that Twitter’s bot accounts ranged between 9% and 15%. Since then, the tool has undergone regular updates to adapt for changes in bot account behavior.

Musk's fraud claim, if proven, isn't enough to ensure he's free from an obligation to buy Twitter. He could still lose if Twitter prevails on own claim that he breached the merger agreement by disparaging the company after entering into the contract. Twitter's stock was trading at $42.81 at noon on Tuesday, down from the $52.29 high it hit the day the Musk deal was announced.

263,Tesla discloses lobbying effort to set up factory in Canada,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc is lobbying the Ontario government as part of an effort to set up an ""advanced manufacturing facility"" in Canada, a filing by the electric-vehicle maker to the province's Office of the Integrity Commissioner showed.

The company's Canadian unit is working with the government to ""identify opportunities for industrial facility permitting reforms"", the amended filing from July 18 said.

Tesla as well as the office of Ontario's minister for economic development, job creation and trade did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Canadian Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne had said in May there were ""very active discussions with a number of players"" to develop an EV supply chain in Canada.

Tesla has been ramping up production with Chief Executive Elon Musk last week speaking half in jest to shareholders yelling ""Canada"" - ""We've got a lot of Canadas, I'm half Canadian, maybe I should.""

He said the company ""might be able"" to announce a new factory later this year and it could ultimately have 10-12 gigafactories. Tesla manufactures vehicles from two factories in the United States and one each in Germany and China.

U.S. electric-vehicle makers are also looking to source materials and build cars closer home to diversify supply chains and lower their dependence on China, the world's largest supplier of EV batteries.

Such efforts could gain pace from a $430-billion bill approved on Sunday by the U.S. Senate that restricts automakers from using Chinese-made materials by phasing in required percentages of North American-sourced battery components.

After 2023, vehicles with batteries that have Chinese parts could not receive the credit, while critical minerals also face limitations on sourcing.

269,Ford hikes F-150 Lightning prices due to cost increases,"Ford (F) today opened the order banks for the next wave of F-150 Lightning reservation holders today, though those fans of the electric pickup may be in for a bit of sticker shock.

Citing “significant material cost increases and other factors,” Ford increased the prices of the F-150 Lighting across the various trim levels on offer.

For instance, the base model, known as the Lightning Pro, which once started at $39,974 has now seen its price rise $7,000 to $46,974. The XLT High Extended Range and Lariat Extended Range trims saw the highest price hikes of $8,500, with each now costing $80,974 and $85,974 respectively. The Platinum Extended range saw the smallest price hike of $6,000, though it now retails for $96,874.

Here is the updated pricing for all trims of the F-150 Lightning:

Pro - $46,974 XLT - $59,474 XLT High - $68,474 XLT High / Extended Range - $80,974 Lariat - $74,474 Lariat Extended Range - $85,974 Platinum Extended Range - $96,874

“Current order holders awaiting delivery are not impacted by these price adjustments,” said Marin Gjaja, Ford Model e chief customer officer in a statement. “We’ve announced pricing ahead of re-opening order banks so our reservation holders can make an informed decision around ordering a Lightning.”

What this means is all reservation holders are now subject to the new prices going into effect today. Ford said reservation holders who previously received an invitation to order but decided to extend their reservation because the trim they wanted wasn’t unavailable, will “receive a private offer for use in upcoming waves.” What that means is unclear, though it sounds like Ford may ease pricing for some of those reservation holders. Ford F-150 Lightning

It’s not all bad news for Ford Lightning buyers, however, as Ford said starting in the fall those models with the standard range battery will see the EPA-estimated range climb 10 miles to 240 miles. The extended range battery will stay the same at 300 miles.

With regards to hiking prices, Ford isn’t alone in the industry. Ford’s competitors like Tesla (TSLA) and Rivian (RIVN) have both raised prices for their electric offerings as costs for battery materials and other critical components like wiring harnesses have skyrocketed as a result of COVID-related supply constraints, and the war in Ukraine.

Story continues

Whether Ford customers will be in an uproar over the price hikes like Rivian reservation holders remains to be seen. Ford stock is slipping lower today in midday trade, underperforming the broader market.

270,Meme stock resurgence: 'There doesn't seem to be much fundamental reason for the activity',"The renewed push higher in meme stocks this month is unlikely to be a carbon copy of the frenzied activity seen in early 2021, one strategist explained.

""That might have been a once-in-a-lifetime move with what we saw in the past,"" Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""What we're seeing is just reemergence of the meme stocks on different time periods, where you've got this retail base that's moving the stock up. Institutions are long and short [on] the names.""

S3 Partners tracks short selling activity and the trading action in retail investor favorites such as Tesla, AMC, and GameStop. Without question, the meme stock trade has come back in force this month — though the community has argued on Twitter that it never went away to begin with.

""There doesn't seem to be much fundamental reason for the activity,"" Dusaniwsky stated. ""I think it's a momentum type of move where you get a little of a move on the charts and more people start following and jumping in. We are also seeing short covering."" A person exits a Bed Bath & Beyond store in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 29, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly

On Monday, the top 10 most actively traded stocks on Fidelity included AMC, Bed Bath & Beyond, and GameStop. Shares of AMC were the second most active on the platform behind the always volatile Tesla.

Bed Bath & Beyond stock spiked 10% in pre-market trading on Tuesday morning following a nearly 40% gain on Monday. Shares then tanked by more than 18% as of 2:29 p.m. ET during afternoon trading as Baird cut its rating on the stock to underperform.

Bed Bath & Beyond stock had surged 88% in August before Tuesday's session.

Bed Bath & Beyond spokesman Eric Mangan did not return Yahoo Finance's request for comment on the stock price movement.

A similar no-news push higher happened to GameStop stock, which fluctuated premarket on Tuesday following an 8.5% gain on Monday. GameStop shares were off by nearly 7% during afternoon trading.

As for AMC Entertainment, the cinema chain's stock was down more than 6% on Tuesday after an 8% increase on Monday following bullish comments by CEO Adam Aron on Yahoo Finance Live.

Story continues

How long the spike in trading activity lasts for meme stocks is anyone's guess. But there is one constant that holds true for most meme names: shaky fundamentals could potentially lead to a lower stock price in the medium term.

""Following the volatility we've seen, it would behoove people to look at fundamentals,"" JP Morgan Private Bank Monica DiCenso warned on Yahoo Finance Live. ""I struggle with some of these names to say why they should be up this much, so I am going to focus more on stories that I can be comfortable with longer-term rather than as a short-term trade for a day or week.""

271,UPDATE 2-Twitter says loading issues fixed after user complaints,"(Adds Twitter statement)

Aug 9 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc said on Tuesday it had fixed issues after thousands of users reported that they were having trouble accessing the micro-blogging platform.

More than 27,000 users had reported outage of the service, according to Downdetector.com, a website which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources including user-submitted errors on its platform.

The outage started at 1.50 p.m. ET and had as many as 35,000 reports at its peak.

""We fixed it! We made an internal systems change that didn't go as planned and have rolled it back. Twitter should now be loading as expected. Sorry about that!,"" Twitter said in a tweet.

This was the second outage in as may months.

The social media company is in a legal tussle with Tesla boss Elon Musk over his $44 billion takeover deal.

Last month, Twitter users faced a nearly three-hour outage in July, with the San Francisco-based company saying it had some trouble with its internal systems that impacted many globally.

Notorious for outages in its early years, Twitter was known for using its popular ""Fail Whale"" illustration, which showed a beluga whale being lifted by birds, during such incidents.

Twitter users took to Reddit to complain about the outage, with many users saying all they could see was the Twitter logo when they tried to log in.

""There is no Twitter to find out why Twitter isn't working"" one user joked on a Reddit channel dedicated to Twitter.

Twitter had suffered another widespread outage in February that it blamed on a software glitch.

Other big technology companies have also been hit by outages in the past year, with a near six-hour disruption at Meta Platforms keeping WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger out of reach for billions of users in October.

272,"Ford reopens reservations for F-150 Lightning EV, hikes price by $6,000","Automotive reporter Pras Subramanian outlines the pricing forecast for Ford's F-150 Lightning as reservations for the EV begin to reopen.

Video Transcript

DAVE BRIGGS: If you've been waiting for your crack at that new Ford F-150 Lightning EV, you'll get your chance this week. But it'll cost you a pretty penny. Senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian here with the latest. And we are hearing this everywhere. This price is going way up.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, so good news for these Lightning fans. Their order banks are opening up once again. But it's going to be a little sticker shock for you, right? So that base model at 39,900 miles that everyone's so jazzed about, $7,000 price hike. In fact, the other trims-- there's about five or six trims-- two of the extended range trims up $8,500. So a lot going on there.

So now Ford says that they will honor the existing pricing for people that actually have an order in the books and a delivery date. But if you're just a reservation holder, like, kind of, like, over, like, 100,000 people that are waiting right now, you're going to be subject to the new pricing coming not too soon from now.

SEANA SMITH: Hey, Pras, if you're in the market for an electric vehicle, so we have Ford hiking their prices, but they're by far not the only one that's doing it within the automakers, right? Because we had Tesla making the announcement earlier this year, and there's been a number of their other competitors that are in the EV space that are also being forced-- I guess you can say forced-- to raise their prices.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, across the industry, they're just really feeling the pinch of these prices. Like you said, Tesla, Elon Musk saying it was embarrassing the amount of price hikes that they can-- and they can do that kind of in real-time on their website, right? Rivian, of course, famously did that big price hike. They had to reverse it for some people who are signed up for that car and very upset about it because it's going to be retroactive. They said no to that. They'll honor some pricing.

Story continues

But anyone else like you or I will pay more money. GM with the Lyriq, of course, too, they're going to jack up prices on a couple of thousand dollars. And then also Lucid, at that high end, the Lucid Air also being raised because they just cannot compete right now with the component costs going up so high.

DAVE BRIGGS: I guess it's a good thing you get a tax refund in this new legislation.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, we'll see.

DAVE BRIGGS: Well, we'll see, right, depending on which model you buy. Jim Farley, Ford's CEO, says we are the only company even close to challenging Tesla in the EV space. True or false?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean, he's not exactly wrong because Ford does have the Mach-E selling well. The F-150 Lightning sold about 4,000 vehicles last quarter-- or through so far this year. So they're still-- they're nipping at the buds at Tesla. But you've got to say that look at VW. They have a couple of vehicles out there. GM next year will have the Trailblazer, the Silverado, and the cheaper Equinox all out next year. So as of right now, you can say, yes, Jim, you're correct, but I think that competition will ramp up very fast over the next year and a half or so.

DAVE BRIGGS: And Hyundai is fairly clear close, right?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, Kia EV6 in the Hyundai. Ioniq 5, yeah, doing really well.

SEANA SMITH: Dave, I just want to know if you're actually going to pull the trigger.

DAVE BRIGGS: On the Ford F-150 EV?

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I know.

DAVE BRIGGS: You know, I love that thing.

SEANA SMITH: 'Cause it's getting more and more expensive, so it makes it a strong argument.

DAVE BRIGGS: 17%--

SEANA SMITH: You should go for-- no, I know.

DAVE BRIGGS: --rise? That might have taken it out of my plans.

SEANA SMITH: I know, I know.

273,Greenlight Bets on a Twitter Win,"Hedge fund Greenlight Capital was founded in 1996 by value investor David Einhorn (Trades, Portfolio). The firm invests primarily in publicly traded North American corporate debt offerings and equities. Einhorn is famous for his successful short bet on Lehman Brothers in 2008.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with TWTR. Click here to check it out.  TWTR 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of TWTR Peter Lynch Chart of TWTR

In his second-quarter 2022 letter to investors, which was released Aug. 1, Einhorn disclosed he invested in Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR). The social media company is currently pursuing litigation against Elon Musk, who is also the CEO and largest shareholder of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), to make good on his agreement to buy Twitter. As I wrote in my previous discussion on this subject, Musk has been trying to renege on the deal.

What's interesting about this development is Einhorn has a history with Musk's Tesla. In 2019 and 2020, he had a short position in the electric vehicle manufacturer. Einhorn ended up losing a considerable amount of money on that holding as Tesla continued to gain.

In his recent letter, Einhorn wrote:

""We havent written about Tesla (TSLA) since 2019, and, we wont break that streak now. Elon Musk is a different story .In 2019 we quipped: 'For now, the accepted reality appears to be that Elon Musk is above the law.' At the time we wrote it we were half serious, half joking. In fact, we thought the law would catch up to him at some point. But it hasnt. Rather, our quip that Musk is above the law has become a widely held belief.""

In regard to Twitter, he went on to say:

""Which brings us to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).In April, Musk agreed to buy TWTR for $54.20 per share. Then, in May, he appeared to change his mind. The case law on this is quite clear. If it were anyone other than Musk, we would handicap the odds of the buyer wiggling out of the deal to be much less than 5%, or the percentage of bots that might be on Twitter.But, it is Musk and therefore many believe that the laws again wont apply. One former judge on the Delaware Chancery Court (where the case is being heard) went on CNBC to speculate that the court might let him out of the deal because Musk wont respect the judgment, which would embarrass the court. Another variation is the court might rule against him, but TWTR might not be able to enforce the judgment.Apparently, many people either believe these outcomes are acceptable or, in the alternative, are just the way the world works. We hope it isnt so.Actually, we can do more than hope. We purchased a position in TWTR at an average of $37.24 per share. At this price there is $17 per share of upside if TWTR prevails in court and we believe about $17 per share of downside, if the deal breaks. So, we are getting 50-50 odds on something that should happen 95%+ of the time.We think that the incentive of the Delaware Chancery Court, the preeminent and most respected business court in the nation, is to actually follow the law and apply it here. If it lets Musk off the hook, it will invite many future buyers remorse suits. Cynical buyers might contract with targets and then use the threat of litigation and the resulting uncertainty to recut the deal.The Delaware Chancery Court has spent years developing case law relating to merger agreements. The resulting precedent and clear understanding of buyers contractual obligations has created a great deal of predictability in this sphere. It will be up to Chancellor McCormick to follow that precedent and protect the sanctity of the court. We like the risk-reward that she will.""

Twitter is currently trading at about $43, so there is still an over 20% arbitrage opportunity between the stock price and the deal price. Einhorn obviously thinks there is a very high chance (according to him, 95% probability) of the deal being completed one way or another. Either Musk will be forced by the court to make good on the deal (there is a specfic performance clause in the purchase agreement) or he will settle with Twitter before the trial.

I agree with Einhorn that Musk's legal position looks weak. Musk's case appears to rest on his position that Twitter induced him to do the deal based on misrepresentation in its SEC filings that the number of ""bots"" (fake accounts) were around 5% of the total. Musk beleives its far higher and this was a ""materially adverse development"" that enabled him to rescind the purchase.

Since the bot issue was well known to all (the two sides differ on the numbers) and Musk did not choose to do any due diligence to verify the fact, the onus will be on him to prove the issue is serious enough to constitute a materially adverse development, which to me looks like a tall order.

Conclusion

Twitter looks like a high probability bet, so Einhorn should be able to recoup some of the money he lost shorting Tesla.

The trial is set to start on Oct. 17 and is expected to last a week. Chances are also good that Musk will settle before or during the trail and before the judgement. If either party loses, they can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court and the buck stops there. But this case is very unlikely to get that far.

I think it is very likely this issue will be settled in Twitter's favor by the end of October.

279,Elon Musk Sells $6.9 Bln Tesla Stock as Twitter Legal Battle Looms,"By Ambar Warrick

Investing.com-- Elon Musk sold about $6.9 billion worth of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock over the past week, a filing revealed on Wednesday, as the Tesla CEO faces a potentially expensive legal battle with Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) over a buyout offer.

Tweeting on the sales, Musk said that he was done selling Tesla stock for now, and said it was important to avoid an “emergency sale” of Tesla stock to potentially fund a takeover of Twitter.

“In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don’t come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock,” Musk said in a tweet.

He also said that he would buy Tesla stock again if the Twitter deal were to not close.

Overnight SEC filings showed that Musk sold about 7.9 million Tesla shares worth about $6.9 billion. Musk offloaded the stake between August 5 to August 9, and now holds about 155 million shares in Tesla, worth $32 billion.

Musk faces a prolonged legal battle with Twitter, as the social media platform seeks to make Musk honor his $44 billion buyout offer.

The world’s richest man offered to take the social media platform private in April, but has since rescinded the offer over an alleged lack of transparency from Twitter over the number of bots on its platform. Twitter has denied such a move.

The two parties are set to go to court in October, with Musk facing either a forced buyout of Twitter, or a hefty fine for calling off the deal.

Musk had sold about $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares in April after announcing the deal. He had then also said that there would be no more stock sales on his end.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk sold $6.9 billion worth of shares in the electric vehicle maker, saying the funds could be used to finance a potential Twitter deal if he loses a legal battle with the social media platform.

""In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don’t come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock,"" he said in a tweet late on Tuesday.

Musk in early July tore up his April 25 agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Twitter has sued Musk to force him to complete the transaction, dismissing his claim that he was misled about the number of spam accounts on the social media platform as buyer's remorse in the wake of a plunge in technology stocks. The two sides head to trial on Oct. 17.

""Street will read through this poker move that chances of Twitter deal more likely now,"" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, tweeted.

In other comments on Twitter on Tuesday, Musk said ""yes"" when asked if he was done selling Tesla stock, and also said he would buy Tesla stock again if the Twitter deal does not close.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Musk, the world's richest person, sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares in April and had said at the time there were no further sales planned. But since then, legal experts had suggested that if Musk is forced to complete the acquisition or settle the dispute with a stiff penalty, he was likely to sell more Tesla shares.

Musk sold about 7.92 million shares between Aug.5 and Aug.9, according to multiple filings. He now owns 155.04 million Tesla shares or just under 15% of the automaker according to Reuters calculations.

The latest sales bring total Tesla stock sales by Musk to about $32 billion in less than one year.

Tesla shares have risen nearly 15% since the automaker reported better-than-expected earnings on July 20, also helped by the Biden administration's climate bill that, if passed, would lift the cap on tax credits for electric vehicles.

Musk also teased on Tuesday that he could start his own social media platform. When asked by a Twitter user if he had thought about creating his own platform if the deal didn't close, he replied: ""X.com""

Tesla’s chief executive officer offloaded about 7.92 million shares on Aug. 5, according to the new filings. The sale comes just four months after the world’s richest person said he had no further plans to sell Tesla shares after disposing of $8.5 billion of stock in the wake of his now-pulled deal to buy Twitter Inc.

Musk, 51, has now sold around $32 billion worth of stock in Tesla over the past 10 months. The disposals started in November after Musk, a prolific Twitter user, polled users of the platform on whether he should trim his stake. The purpose of the latest sales wasn’t immediately clear.

Tesla shares have risen about 35% from recent lows reached in May, though are still down about 20% this year.

With a $250.2 billion fortune, Musk is the world’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, but his wealth has fallen around $20 billion this year as Tesla shares declined.

Musk May Keep Selling Tesla, With or Without Twitter: MLIV Pulse

Musk last month said he was terminating his $44 billion agreement to acquire Twitter and take it private, claiming the company has made “misleading representations” over the number of spam bots on the service. Twitter has since sued to force Musk to consummate the deal, and a trial in the Delaware Chancery Court has been set for October.

At the weekend, Musk tweeted that if Twitter provided its method of sampling accounts to determine the number of bots and how they are confirmed to be real, “the deal should proceed on original terms.”

In May, Musk dropped plans to partially fund the purchase with a margin loan tied to his Tesla stake and increased the size of the equity component of the deal to $33.5 billion. He had previously announced that he secured $7.1 billion of equity commitments from investors including billionaire Larry Ellison, Sequoia Capital and Binance.

289,"U.S. CPI, Tesla Stock Sale, Disney Results, EIA Stocks - What's Moving Markets","By Peter Nurse

Investing.com -- The main focus of the day will be the release of the latest U.S. consumer price data and the potential impact this has on Fed thinking. Elon Musk’s sale of more Tesla stock will also put the electric car maker in the spotlight, along with Disney’s third quarter results and official crude inventory numbers. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, August 10.

1. U.S. CPI in spotlight

The main focus of investors’ attention Wednesday will be the release of the U.S. consumer price index for July, which is expected to play a significant part in the thinking of Federal Reserve policymakers over future interest rate hikes.

The U.S. CPI is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) and is expected to have risen 0.2% last month after advancing 1.3% in June. This would equate to an annual increase of 8.7%, down slightly from the 9.1% seen in the prior month.

While that would be the largest month-on-month deceleration of price increases since 2005, largely on the back of a sharp drop in the cost of gasoline, the report, however, is still likely to show that underlying inflation pressures remain elevated.

The annual core CPI figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is seen actually rising to 6.1%, from 5.9% in June.

The Fed has indicated that several monthly declines in CPI growth would be needed before it lets up on the aggressive monetary policy tightening. This suggests that a much more substantial move lower is needed for the central bank policymakers to decide against another super-sized interest rate hike in September.

2. Musk sells more Tesla stock

Elon Musk has boosted his legal war chest, with the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO selling an additional $6.9 billion worth of shares in the electric vehicle maker over the past week, an SEC filing revealed on Wednesday.

Musk stated, in a series of tweets, that he wanted to avert an emergency sale of stock if he is compelled to complete the $44 billion takeover of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which he has subsequently tried to back away from.

Story continues

The billionaire is set to go to court in October and faces either a forced buyout of Twitter or a hefty fine for calling off the deal.

Musk has now sold around $32 billion worth of stock in Tesla over the past 10 months, but this move comes just four months after he said he had no further plans to further dispose of stock after an $8.5 billion sale in the wake of his initial offer to buy the social media platform.

3. Stocks set to edge higher; Roblox Slumps

U.S. stock markets are set to open marginally higher Wednesday, bouncing back after a series of weaker sessions, with the focus on the release of a key inflation report.

By 6:00 AM ET (1000 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 65 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures were up 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.3%.

The main Wall Street indices all closed lower Tuesday, with the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropping for their third straight sessions, after the likes of Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX), and Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST) warned of future earnings weakness.

The latest consumer prices report [see above] is set to drive activity Wednesday as it could influence future Fed interest rate moves.

In corporate news, results from Disney [see below] lead the way, but Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) will also be in the spotlight after the crypto exchange reported a massive $1.1 billion net loss in the second quarter, citing a ""fast and furious"" downturn of the crypto markets.

Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) stock was sharply lower premarket after the video game publisher reported a wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter, while Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) disappointed as the gaming company’s Macau Resort struggled with COVID issues.

4. Disney+ streaming subscribers in focus

Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) will be in the spotlight Wednesday, as the entertainment giant is scheduled to publish its fiscal third quarter results after the market close.

The focus will be on the Disney+ streaming service following the loss of streaming rights to Indian Premier League cricket and after rival Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) impressed with its subscriber figures a couple of weeks ago.

Demand for Disney’s theme parks is expected to have bounced back strongly, and the segment may outperform expectations despite a $350 million hit from overseas closings.

Investors could also be looking for more information following a New York Times report that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has held talks with media companies, including Disney, about including streaming entertainment in its membership service.

5. Oil falls; EIA inventory data due

Crude oil prices weakened Wednesday after an industry report showed a surprise increase in U.S. inventories, prompting concerns of falling demand in the world’s largest consumer.

Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. crude stocks rose by around 2.2 million barrels last week, much more than the 100,000 barrels predicted.

Such a result, if confirmed by official government data later Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration, would mark a second straight week of an unexpectedly large build in U.S. oil inventories.

“EIA weekly data shows that implied gasoline demand in the U.S. has been seasonally weak so far this summer, given the higher pump prices,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “The more recent weakness in prices may limit the demand destruction that some may feel is needed in order to keep the market balanced.”

By 6:00 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.9% at $89.72 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 0.9% at $95.47 a barrel.

290,Dow Futures Edge Higher Ahead of CPI Data; Disney Earnings Eyed,"By Noreen Burke

Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edged higher on Wednesday as investors awaited the release of U.S. inflation data ahead of the open that will be a key factor in shaping market expectations around the size of upcoming rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

At 07:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 58 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures traded 7 points, or 0.2% higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 18 points, or 0.1%.

The slight gains came after all three main indices on Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday after a dire forecast from Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) weighed on chip makers and tech stocks.

Investors were looking ahead to the July inflation numbers after last week’s blowout employment report eroded some optimism that the Fed might pivot to a slower pace of rate hikes after delivering 225 basis points worth of rate hikes so far this year as it attempts to curb soaring price increases.

Traders are weighing the chances of the Fed hiking rates by 75 bps at its next meeting in September, in what would be its third major increase in a row. Any indications that inflation has peaked could be enough for policymakers to ease back on aggressive monetary tightening.

Corporate earnings will also be in focus, with Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) due to publish its third-quarter results after the market close. Investors will be focusing on the Disney+ streaming service following the loss of streaming rights to Indian Premier League cricket and after rival Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) impressed with its subscriber figures a couple of weeks ago.

Demand for Disney’s theme parks is expected to have bounced back strongly, and the segment may outperform expectations despite a $350 million hit from overseas closings.

Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) was lower in premarket trade after the crypto exchange reported a massive $1.1 billion net loss in the second quarter, citing a ""fast and furious"" downturn of the crypto markets.

Story continues

Video game publisher Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) was also sharply lower premarket after reporting a larger-than-forecast second-quarter loss, while Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) disappointed as the gaming company’s Macau Resort struggled with COVID issues.

An SEC filing on Wednesday revealed that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elo Musk sold an additional $6.9 billion worth of shares in the electric vehicle maker over the past week.

In a series of tweets, Musk said the funds could be used to finance a potential Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) deal if he loses a legal battle with the social media platform.

Oil prices slid after industry data late Tuesday pointing to an unexpected increase in U.S. inventories last week rekindled concerns over the demand outlook.

Weekly U.S. oil inventory data from the Energy Information Administration are due later Wednesday.

By 07:00 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were 1.7% lower at $89.00 a barrel, while the Brent contract was down 1.6% to $94.72 a barrel.

Meanwhile, gold futures eased down to $1,806.05/oz, while the euro was 0.2% higher at $1.0239.

The average age of a Fortune 500 CFO is 53. However, there’s a portion of finance chiefs who work at some of America’s largest companies that haven’t yet reached age 40. Meta’s Susan Li will become the latest addition to the list, which also includes the ""Master of Coin.""

Li, age 36, has served as the VP of finance at Meta, the parent company of Facebook, since 2008. The company announced in its recent Q2 2022 earnings report that current CFO David Wehner will take on a new role as Meta's first chief strategy officer, effective Nov. 1, and Li will be promoted to CFO.

“I joined Meta 14 years ago, back when we were a handful of Facebook employees scattered across a few buildings in downtown Palo Alto,” Li wrote in a LinkedIn post on July 27 following the announcement.  “I’ve been lucky to work at a company that has grown tremendously during my career.”

When first joining the company, she was one of two people focused on revenue forecasts, sales budget plans and business operations. Li played an integral part of the finance team that helped with Facebook’s IPO and was promoted to a VP of Finance in 2016, according to the company. Before her career at Meta, the Stanford University grad was an analyst at Morgan Stanley.

""I’m delighted that Susan Li will take over as CFO,"" Wehner said in a LinkedIn post. ""She has been a key partner since I joined Facebook a decade ago, and this transition is part of a long-term succession plan that we have been discussing for several years."" Li began co-presenting alongside Wehner during Meta’s quarterly follow-up earnings calls in 2020. According to research Meta shared with me on the top 25 S&P companies' CFOs, 20 of the 25 finance chiefs are male. And Li will become the sixth female CFO in the top 25 when taking over in November.

Li will be at the helm of finance at a time when the company is laser-focused on the metaverse. In Q2, Meta reported its first revenue decline since going public a decade ago, Fortune reported. Meta earned $28.15 billion in revenue for the second quarter, down from $29.07 billion a year earlier. As the strategic partner to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, age 38, Li will play a critical role in shaping and executing future metaverse investments.

Story continues

Another CFO under the age of 40 in the technology sector is Tesla's 37-year-old Zachary Kirkhorn, aka the “Master of Coin.” While Tesla CEO Elon Musk is currently being sued by Twitter for terminating his $44 billion deal to buy the company, and Musk spars with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal about bots, Kirkhorn has been managing Tesla’s balance sheet amid a crypto winter. The company announced in its recent Q2 earnings report it had sold 75% of its remaining Bitcoin. Kirkhorn became finance chief in 2019, helping the electric car company’s balance sheet by billions of dollars. He landed his first job out of school with McKinsey & Co. and joined Tesla Inc. while still in his mid-20s.

Here are the remaining Fortune 500 CFOs under the age of 40:

-Celso Goncalves, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., EVP and CFO, 34

-Jessica Fischer, Charter Communications, Inc., CFO, 35

-James P. Todd, Landstar Systems, Inc., VP, principal accounting officer and CFO, 35

-Kaes Van’t Hof, Diamondback Energy, Inc., president and CFO, 35

-Zach Davis, Cheniere Energy Inc., EVP and CFO, 37

-Paul Shoukry, Raymond James Financial, Inc., CFO, senior VP of finance and investor relations and treasurer, 38

-Brian J. Choi, Avis Budget Group Inc., EVP and CFO, 39

-Emma E. Giamartino, CBRE Group, Inc., global group president, CFO and chief investment officer, 39

-Robin M. Raju, Equitable Holdings, Inc., senior VP and CFO, 39

-David M. Wold, Weyerhaeuser Company, EVP and CFO, 39

301,5 Undervalued Auto Stocks to Buy Before They Zoom Higher,"Along with the broad market correction, auto stocks have declined in 2022. The S&P 500 Automobile Manufacturers Sub Industry Index has corrected by more than 20% during this period. This correction presents a good opportunity to accumulate some undervalued auto stocks.

The industry faces near-term headwinds that include inflation and a possible recession. Supply chain challenges have also impacted the auto industry. However, the long-term outlook remains robust. This is particularly true as the electric vehicle segment continues to grow at a healthy pace.

It’s worth noting that the global automotive market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.7% through 2030. For the same period, the electric vehicle market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21.7%. It’s not surprising that traditional automakers are making a big shift toward electric vehicles.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

With impending growth opportunities, it’s a good time to accumulate some undervalued auto stocks. My focus is on pure-play electric vehicle companies as well as traditional automakers that are positioned for growth.

Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock has been an outperformer among electric vehicle stocks in the last six months. Even after the rally, LI stock is among the top undervalued auto stocks to consider.

There are three major reasons to like Li Auto from among Chinese electric vehicle stocks. First, the company has reported strong growth in vehicle deliveries on a sustained basis. For July 2022, Li reported 21.3% growth in deliveries on a year-over-year basis to 10,422.

Further, since launch in November 2019, Li Auto has delivered growth with just one model, LI ONE. As of July 2022, the cumulative deliveries of Li ONE have reached 194,913. The company’s second model, Li L9, a smart SUV, will be open for mass deliveries in August 2022. In the coming quarters, the new model will help in accelerating deliveries growth.

Story continues

Another important point to note is that Li reported free cash flow of $79.2 million for Q1 2022. As FCF swells, Li will be positioned to make bigger investments.

Tesla (TSLA) A person walks past the storefront of a Tesla store with several vehicles visible behind a glass door

In the recent market correction, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock had plunged to lows of $620. It didn’t take long, however, for the leading electric vehicle company to bounce back. TSLA stock is higher by 46% from lows at $910.

There is another stock split in the cards for Tesla. However, the rally is factoring in several positive catalysts. With production and mass deliveries for the Cybertruck and Roadster likely in the next 12-24 months, there is a catalyst for deliveries growth.

Further, the European Gigafactory might be incurring losses currently. However, once manufacturing is ramped up, it will boost sales and help in improving the company-wide EBITDA margin.

Given strong cash flows, Tesla is also positioned to make big investments. There is a possibility of another Gigafactory in Indonesia.

In terms of risks, geopolitical tensions might impact the company’s outlook for growth in China. However, Tesla remains positioned for sustained growth and upside in free cash flows.

Undervalued Auto Stocks: Ford Motor (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.

Among traditional automakers, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) seems attractively valued. It’s worth noting that F stock has surged by 31% in the last month. However, the stock still trades at a forward price-earnings-ratio of 7.9x.

One reason for the recent rally is the company’s earnings beat for Q2 2022. The company has also provided investors a reason to cheer with an optimistic guidance. Ford expects adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion for 2022.

Another reason for F stock trending higher is the company’s ambitious plans for the electric vehicle segment. For 2022, Ford has reaffirmed the guidance for production of 600,000 EVs. Further, the company is targeting production of more than 2 million units (annually) by the end of 2026.

From a financial perspective, Ford reported a total liquidity buffer of $45.1 billion as of Q2 2022. The company has a robust balance sheet to invest in growth. At the same time, dividends are sustainable with the company currently offering a dividend yield of 1.9%.

General Motors (GM) Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.

General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock has been in a correction mode with a decline of 38% for 2022. At a forward P/E of 5.4x, the downside for GM stock seems to be capped. With General Motors also committed to an all-electric future, there is a reason to be optimistic.

Talking about the growth plans, General Motors expects to have 1 million units of annual EV capacity in North America by 2025. The company has already been securing commitments for lithium, cobalt and nickel.

Over the long-term, the company expects to deliver $90 billion in annual EV revenue by 2030. This seems realistic considering the under-penetration of electric vehicles globally.

General Motors has guided for adjusted automotive free cash flow of $7 billion to $9 billion for 2022. The company expects to double revenue from current levels by 2030 along with EBITDA margin expansion.

Given this guidance, free cash flow is likely to be in excess of $20 billion by 2030. GM stock is therefore likely to be a long-term value creator.

Undervalued Auto Stocks: Rivian Automotive (RIVN) rivn stock sign outside the company's HQ in Silicon Valley

Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock

Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) has surged roughly 100% from 2022 lows near $19.30. However, RIVN stock remains undervalued from a long-term perspective.

For Q2 2022, Rivian delivered 4,467 vehicles. The company has also reiterated the guidance to produce 25,000 vehicles for 2022. However, this is just the beginning of the long-term growth story.

To put things into perspective, the company plans to increase annual production capacity to 600,000 between Normal and Georgia plants. With $17 billion in cash and equivalents as of March 2022, the company is positioned to make aggressive investments.

It’s also worth noting that Rivian already has more than 90,000 pre-orders for R1 from the U.S. and Canada. With potential expansion in Europe and China in the next few years, there is a big addressable market. Deliveries growth is likely to be robust on a sustained basis.

Rivian also has an initial order for 100,000 electric delivery vans from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). With potential for big orders in the EDV segment, the revenue visibility is robust.

310,This Analyst is Bullish on 8 Auto Stocks for the Rest of 2022,"In this article, we’ll discuss the 8 auto stocks analyst Itay Michaeli at Citi has a bullish stance on. If you want to skip our discussion on the automotive industry outlook, go directly to This Analyst is Bullish on 4 Auto Stocks for the Rest of 2022.

In a research note issued on August 2, Itay Michaeli at Citi increased the EPS estimates for multiple auto stocks as we head into the second half of 2022. He cited the increase in optimism in management’s tone during the Q2 2022 earnings call of these companies as the reason for increasing his forecasts. Michaeli added that the reiteration of guidance and the resilience of demand in the US automobile sector were expected during the earnings call. However, the bullishness on the European auto market shown by the management of various automobile companies was a surprise, considering the economic uncertainty and supply chain-related issues. He anticipates the feeling of optimism to flow to the investors and result in the outperformance of the auto sector against the broader market in 2022. After incorporating the impact of positive developments, the analyst increased the target prices for notable companies like Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Visteon Corporation (NASDAQ:VC).

The automotive industry has undergone substantial changes as it strives to meet rising consumer expectations and overcome the obstacles connected with autonomous, electric, and hybrid vehicles. The international automotive industry recovered from setbacks brought on by the pandemic with a respectable 5.3% increase in sales in 2021. The industry is going through a transformation as the focus is shifting from conventional fuel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles to reduce the adverse impact on the environment.

EV Revolution

As per Bloomberg data, global EV sales exceeded expectations last year. Between 2020 and 2021, the sales almost doubled to 6.6 million units. By 2030, the sales are projected to reach 32 million units yearly. From 2011 to 2021, EV sales increased by a staggering 174 times on a global scale. Over the same timeframe, EV sales in the United States surged by 38 times. Furthermore, the sale of accessories and auto replacement parts online is anticipated to reach $50 billion globally in 2022. The aftermarket will see an increase in demand for specialized services and equipment maintenance due to the rising EV population.

There are significant limitations to these upbeat predictions, though. Consumer demand seems to be evident, but before EV manufacturing and sales can expand, the automotive industry needs to act swiftly to remove key obstacles. These include strained supply chains following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a dearth of battery-producing gigafactories, inadequate productivity in already-existing facilities, and the lack of public charging infrastructure.

Michaeli’s Stance on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)

We would also like to highlight Michaeli’s contrarian call on one of the leading EV producers globally, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Although the analyst increased the price target on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) from $375 to $425, he still maintained a Sell rating on the stock. The target price reflects a potential downside of over 50% from the closing price as of August 5. The analyst increased the EPS forecasts for the second half of the year following the company’s Q2 2022 earnings beat due to strong execution.

However, Michaeli believes that the valuation of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) “remains challenged.” He highlighted that his investment thesis would only change if he saw more concrete proof of progress from the deployment of Level 4 autonomy and RoboTaxi. Level 4 of driving autonomy is regarded as High Driving Automation. This means that in case something goes wrong, the artificial intelligence (AI) embedded in the automobile will be able to intervene on its own without the need for human assistance in the majority of circumstances. However, a human can manually override also. According to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, the autonomous RoboTaxi service will be a combination of Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Musk also added that RoboTaxi is not getting designed by keeping a launch city in mind, but it would be a general solution that could work across the planet.

Our Methodology

Let’s begin our list of the eight auto stocks on which Michaeli has a bullish stance. We will go through the comments made by the analyst and discuss the growth drivers for these companies. The stocks have been ranked according to the number of hedge fund holders as of the first quarter of 2022.

8. Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC (NASDAQ:PSNY)

Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC (NASDAQ:PSNY) went public on June 24 through a SPAC deal. The trading of shares commenced one day after the successful merger with the SPAC Gores Guggenheim.

The EV maker intends to use the $890 million generated by the IPO to fund its operations for the next three years as the company is looking to design and manufacture new EV models and achieve profitability. Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC (NASDAQ:PSNY) was established in 2017 as a result of a joint venture between Swedish auto manufacturer Volvo and Chinese auto giant Geely. The company consolidated its operations and prepared itself for the hyper-growth phase before coming out to raise capital.

Michaeli initiated coverage on Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC (NASDAQ:PSNY) with a Buy and a High-Risk rating and a target price of $13. The analyst expects the company to gain nearly 6% of the global market share by 2030. Michaeli also favored Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC’s (NASDAQ:PSNY) asset-light model due to the presence of strong partners.

Although the analyst presented a positive outlook on Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC (NASDAQ:PSNY) stock, he also highlighted a few expected headwinds. Foreign exchange fluctuations and volatility in commodity prices and supply could adversely impact the operations of Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC (NASDAQ:PSNY) in the future.

7. Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16

Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) is a Manhattan Beach, California-based manufacturer of EVs. The company was founded and is led by widely known car designer Henrik Fisker and his wife Geeta Gupta-Fisker.

In a research note issued on August 4, Michaeli increased the price target on Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) from $27 to $28 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst highlighted that he found no unexpected updates in the company’s “fairly encouraging” Q2 2022 results. He also added that at the current valuation, the setup plays in favor of Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) as the company heads towards achieving important milestones.

Industry experts think that Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) may require a liquidity injection in the next six months to execute the Ocean ramp plan, which involves increasing the production of the company’s all-electric SUV Fisker Ocean. However, it could be difficult to achieve this as the rising interest rate, and concerns related to growth have made access to new capital challenging. There is also a near-term execution risk hanging over the company as its complete production is based in Austria, and the country could face the brunt of the gas shortage in Europe.

Moore Global Investments was the leading hedge fund investor in Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) during Q1 2022.

6. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16

Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) is a Newark, California-based luxury EV company. The company is led by CEO Peter Rawlinson. He was the former chief engineer of the Tesla Model S.

Although the company reported weak Q2 2022 results on August 3, the Citi analyst reiterated his Buy rating on Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) stock with a target price of $28. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) reported disappointing results as supply chain constraints at its Casa Grande factory near Phoenix, Arizona, took a toll on the quarterly results. These developments caused the company to lower its 2022 production guidance to 6,000 - 7,000 units only as opposed to the prior guidance of 12,000 - 14,000 units.

However, experts consider Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) as one of the strongest EV players outside of China that could survive in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The luxurious Lucid Air has the longest range of 517 miles with the most efficient battery.

Out of the 912 hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q1 2022, 16 funds held a stake in Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID).

5. Luminar Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:LAZR)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16

Luminar Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:LAZR) is an Orlando, Florida-based provider of vehicle safety and self-driving products and technologies.

Michaeli gave Luminar Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:LAZR) stock a Buy rating with a target price of $24 on May 6. The analyst thinks that Luminar Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:LAZR) can be termed a long-term investment. It has the first mover advantage in the key Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology that is an integral part of the sensing technology for autonomous driving to progress.

The company reported its Q2 2022 results on August 8. Luminar Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:LAZR) recorded revenue of $9.9 million, beating the analysts' estimates of $8.59 million. Furthermore, the company raised the FY22 guidance for its forward-looking order book to a growth rate of 60% YoY, from prior guidance of 40%.

Founder and CEO Austin Russel is the biggest shareholder in Luminar Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:LAZR), with a stake of over 38%.

In addition to Luminar Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:LAZR) and Visteon Corporation (NASDAQ:VC), Michaeli also has a positive outlook on Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

JULIE HYMAN: I took a look at Tesla and Twitter this morning. Both of them are trading higher following news that Elon Musk sold $6.9 billion worth of Tesla shares. It's according to a series of SEC filings that were published on Tuesday. The sale happened the day immediately following Tesla's annual shareholder meeting on August 4.

In a tweet addressing the sale, Musk said, he's done selling. This is due to the possibility of Twitter forcing him to follow through with the buy. He didn't want to do what he was calling an emergency sale or a fire sale, perhaps, of the shares.

So we're talking about 7.92 million shares being sold on August 5. One little irony here, as one analyst pointed out, is that he said at the shareholder meeting the day before, that any weakness in the stock was a buying opportunity. Well, guess not. And the shares, by the way, were down 6.6% on Friday. Now, we know why.

BRAD SMITH: He still owns 155--

JULIE HYMAN: Yes.

BRAD SMITH: --million Tesla shares, worth about $131 billion. So you do the math on the market cap of Tesla. That's about 15% of Tesla that he's still comfortably holding on to, even with this sale.

BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I think he's gonna make it through here, guys. But the read through, of course, is what it means for Twitter.

JULIE HYMAN: Yes.

BRIAN SOZZI: Like we've just been discussing, Dan Ives over at Wedbush saying in a note, ""The chances of a Twitter deal now more likely,"" in his opinion, raising his price target on Twitter to $50 from $30. So I think-- I'm surprised that Twitter ticker is not popping on the Yahoo Finance platform. But still, it now-- the Street is taking this as a clear sign that maybe he does want to get this deal done.

JULIE HYMAN: Well--

BRIAN SOZZI: Or is forced to get it done.

JULIE HYMAN: Right. Or it's sort of an admission that it's possible he will lose in court, which is kind of an interesting position for him to take. Maybe an acknowledgment that his case is not ironclad when it comes to Twitter, right?

Story continues

BRIAN SOZZI: Shocker.

JULIE HYMAN: Which is kind of interesting here. He also said, by the way, again, he's not gonna sell any more shares. But he said four months ago he wasn't gonna sell any more shares. I mean, yes, the circumstances have changed, if indeed he has to buy Twitter. But nonetheless, I don't know how much credibility he has when he says he's not gonna sell any more shares.

BRAD SMITH: He also did it in December as well.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.

BRAD SMITH: And so this just continues--

JULIE HYMAN: He did that for-- what was it, tax purposes--

BRAD SMITH: Tax--

JULIE HYMAN: --or something?

BRAD SMITH: --purposes [? again. ?] Yeah, because you put the poll out there. And so I guess you got to follow through on that. But I mean, at the same day, it's Elon Musk continuing to just be Elon Musk at this point. And in this case, have to actually-- or at least some omission here that he may actually have to go through with this acquisition and consummate the deal between himself, and X Holdings and Twitter.

BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I'm sure this just-- the Tesla Bulls have to like this because this ultimately means maybe Musk doesn't have to force-- or isn't forced to sell Tesla shares last minute at a fire sale price should he have to get this deal done.

JULIE HYMAN: I mean, Tesla Bulls will find a reason to like this. I don't know what would be good about this necessarily for Tesla. I mean, yes, that is one good thing about it. But if he's forced to buy Twitter, he's still gonna be distracted by this whole Twitter situation. I would imagine if you're a Tesla shareholder at this point, you just want that over and done with.

And if he's forced to buy Twitter, it's not over and done with. He's got to run the company or figure out somebody else to run the company, right? So you know, that seems to me to be an overhang, I would think, for those Tesla shares as well.",2022-08-10T13:33:25+00:00,2022-08-10

Just look at Amazon.com Inc. The retail and cloud-storage giant announced a $3.49 billion deal to buy software company 1Life Healthcare Inc. last month, and last week it said it would pay $1.65 billion for iRobot Corp., maker of the Roomba vacuum.

Just 10 days into August, about $13.4 billion of tech-related mergers and acquisitions have been unveiled in North America, according to Bloomberg data, which already would make it the busiest month since May. In the largest deal, buyout firm Vista Equity Partners agreed to buy tax software provider Avalara Inc. for $8.4 billion including debt.

“August has historically been a quiet month for M&A, so it is surprising to see such a flurry of deals,” said Larry Feldman, a research analyst at United First Partners. Dealmaking may be getting a boost from improved market conditions for debt financing, he said.

And the sector still is cheaper than at the height of the roaring bull market early this year. The Nasdaq 100 Index is priced at 22 times estimated earnings now, down from a recent peak of 31 in September 2020, even if it is up from the June low of 18.6.

Amazon’s targets certainly aren’t selling at the peak: iRobot fell 77% from its high of $161.16 last year through last month as it struggled with supply-chain issues. Similarly, One Medical’s stock hit a record low of about $6 in May from 2021’s all-time high near $60, before agreeing to sell at $18.

There are some headwinds deterring the biggest companies from massive acquisitions: They face stepped-up antitrust scrutiny in the US, which has some traders skeptical that recent marquee deals -- such as Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. -- will go through. Activision’s shares are still trading about 15% below the offer price.

And Apple Inc., which used to acquire a company every three or four weeks, has dramatically slowed its dealmaking in the past two years.

Still, big companies and buyout firms are flush with cash, and plenty of smaller tech companies are looking at a slowing economy and tougher business environment in the near future.

“So this is a good time for them to get off the merry-go-around,” said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at CapWealth, a wealth management firm in Franklin, Tennessee.

Tech Chart of the Day

S&P 500 companies have cut cash holdings by 12% from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Amazon is leading the pack with a $29 billion cut to its cash pile, following by fellow mega-caps Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. Apple, Microsoft and Meta have used cash to fund their share repurchase programs, while Amazon has the biggest capital expenditure budget in the group.

Elon Musk offloaded $6.9 billion of stock in Tesla Inc., the billionaire’s biggest sale on record, saying he wanted to avoid a last-minute selloff of the electric-car maker’s shares in the event he is forced to go ahead with his aborted deal to buy Twitter Inc. Roblox Corp., a video-game platform aimed at preteens and teenagers, reported bookings that missed analysts’ estimates, becoming the latest gaming company to deliver disappointing results amid a post-pandemic industrywide slump. Semiconductors stocks tumbled after Micron Technology Inc. warned of slowing demand, adding to concern the industry is heading into a painful downturn.

Micron Technology Inc. plans to slow hiring as it copes with a sudden drop in chip demand, but the company joined peers such as Intel Corp.and Nvidia Corp. in deciding that major job cuts aren’t yet necessary. President Joe Biden signed into law a broad competition bill Tuesday that includes about $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor research and development, calling it a “once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.” Lenovo Group Ltd.’s profit jumped a better-than-projected 11% after the world’s largest maker of personal computers relied on businesses beyond PCs to counter a worsening slump in global electronics demand. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the maker of most of the world’s iPhones, posted a profit that beat estimates as demand for its cloud products helped it weather supply-chain snarls and sluggish smartphone demand. Taiwan wants to force Foxconn Technology Group to unwind an $800 million investment in Chinese chipmaker Tsinghua Unigroup, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. A Nebraska woman was charged with two felonies related to an illegal abortion after authorities discovered information about the pregnancy through private messages on Facebook Messenger, according to court documents. The case renewed debate about how law enforcement may use social media accounts in cases involving reproductive choices.

Segmental Performance

In the reported quarter, the Americas segment recorded revenues of $1,673 million, increasing 16.2% from the year-ago period and topping the consensus metric of $1,565 million. The segment posted adjusted EBITDA of $70 million, shooting up 204.3% from the prior-year period. The increase was driven by improved volume and mix resulting from modestly improved customer production schedules, improved business performance and favorable net commodities and forex. The figure also topped the consensus metric of $48.54 million.

In the fiscal third quarter, the EMEA segment registered revenues of $1,215 million, declining 8.5% year over year and lagging the consensus mark of $1,262 million. However, the segment recorded $31 million in EBITDA in the quarter under review, soaring 40.9% and topping the consensus mark of $21.94 million.

The segment’s adjusted EBITDA came down 30.4% to $64 million and missed the consensus mark of $90 million. Lower equity income, unfavorable volume and mix stemming from rising COVID-19 infections in China and increased freight costs hurt EBITDA.

316,S&amp;P 500 Rides Tech Rally as Easing Inflation Pushes U.S. Yields Lower,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 jumped Wednesday, led by tech on falling U.S. Treasury yields as data pointing to signs that inflation may be nearing a peak eased fears that the Federal Reserve will have to continue with aggressive rate hikes.

The S&P 500 rose 1.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.5%, or 481 points, the Nasdaq was up 2.6%.

The U.S. consumer price index, a measure of inflation, was flat in June compared with expectations for a 0.2% rise. In the 12 months through July, headline inflation eased to 8.5% from 9.1% in June but was still the highest since 1981.

The data suggested that inflation has “passed its peak,” Commerzbank said, as the “collapse in the price of gasoline played a decisive role.”

U.S. Treasury yields slumped as investors bet on a less hawkish Fed, with the 2-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to fed rate hikes, slipping more than 2%.

Tech stocks, which have had a rocky start to the week following pressure from falling chip stocks this week, were aided by falling Treasury yields, which make valuations on growth stocks like tech more attractive.

Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta (NASDAQ:META), led the gains for big tech, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were up more than 2% each.

Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, gained more than 2% on bets that the social media giant may win its legal battle with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief executive Elon Musk to force the billionaire to complete his $44 billion deal to buy the company.

The Tesla CEO sold nearly $7 billion in Tesla shares over the past few days, to “avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock” should Twitter force the deal to close, Musk said.

“[T]he chances of a Twitter deal now more likely,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, and raised the price target on Twitter to $50 from $30. reflecting the “higher chances the deal now ultimately closes.”

Financials, mostly banks, were also in ascendency as the Treasury yield curve steepened, though remained inverted pointing to ongoing fears of a recession, albeit a milder downturn somewhat, following the latest inflation data and strong jobs report last week.

Story continues

The 2-year Treasury yield over 10-year yield steepened to 40 basis points following a dip to lower than negative 50 basis intraday.

Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), and SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) were among the biggest gainers, with the latter up more than 9%.

Energy stocks lagged the broader market move higher as oil prices pared some early-day gains after data showing U.S. weekly inventories jumped by a more-than-expected 5.5 million barrels last week.

In earnings news, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) climbed 7% as the crypto exchange operator's wider-than-expected loss was overshadowed by a jump in bitcoin.

Video Transcript

- 8 million shares, I believe, is worth about, $6.9 billion that he sold, and this was after he said that he wasn't going to sell any more shares.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: He said he wasn't in any planned sales. So yeah. Late last night, we're watching this on Twitter, as filings come in on Edgar, 6.9 billion worth of shares sold over the last three days. You know, Musk did sell these shares at a recent new-- like kind of like newish high for Tesla, around $900 a share, which is actually pretty good for them. So he did time it kind of right.

He said in a tweet, kind of like, in the event that Twitter forces this deal to close-- this is kind of what we're seeing, speculation of the Twitter deal closing-- and some equity partners don't come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock. So we're seeing that he's sort of anticipating a potential forcing of a deal, as this trial begins, on October 17th, between Twitter and Elon Musk. If they do demand like specific performance, like hey, close a deal, he's going to have to do it, or he's going to have to like pay a big settlement to kind of clear that away.

- Does that suggest that maybe he could sell even more? That maybe he saw the stock rebound, and said, all, right I'll sell a little bit right now. But I'll keep some more, in case Tesla stock rises even further, and then maybe cash out even more. Or do you think that $7 billion in the tank is kind of good enough for now? I mean, this is speculation, I imagine.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. I mean, he's been raising a ton of money. I think it's been like almost $30 billion in sales, since November. So if he's required to buy Twitter, and it's a possibility-- this might be it, but like you said, he said before, I'm not going to sell anymore, and he did.

So it's hard to say if he would actually do more, and he's got like 15% of the company. So he still owns a lot. The trial is the big is the big factor. I think some analysts were talking about how this is still a big overhang, big problem with Tesla stock and Elon Musk. So we'll see what happens.

322,Stock Market Today: Dow Racks Up Gains as Easing Inflation Triggers Tech Rally,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The Dow racked up gains Wednesday, as data pointing to signs of easing inflation stoked bets on less aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes and sent U.S. Treasury yields tumbling pushing growth sectors of the market including tech sharply higher.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6%, or 535 points, the Nasdaq was up 2.9%, the S&P 500 rose 2.1%.

The U.S. consumer price index, a measure of inflation, was flat in June compared with expectations for a 0.2% rise. In the 12 months through July, headline inflation eased to 8.5% from 9.1% in June but was still the highest since 1981.

The data suggested that inflation has “passed its peak,” Commerzbank said, as the “collapse in the price of gasoline played a decisive role.”

Others, however, believe that inflation may still surprise to the upside in the coming months as oil prices are yet to peak.

""I wouldn't be in that camp that thinks we're at peak inflation,"" Sean O'Hara, president of Pacer ETFs, told Investing.com in an interview on Wednesday. ""We haven't fixed the supply chain problem and I don't think we've seen peak oil for this year yet.""

U.S. Treasury yields slumped as investors bet on a less hawkish Fed, with the 2-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to fed rate hikes, slipping more than 2%.

Tech stocks, which have had a rocky start to the week following pressure from falling chip stocks this week, were aided by falling Treasury yields, which make valuations on growth stocks like tech more attractive.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

AKIKO FUJITA: Just about 20 minutes left in the trading day. We are seeing Tesla shares trading higher, up about 3 and 1/2%, after Elon Musk revealed he sold nearly 8 million Tesla shares, bringing in $6.9 billion. Yahoo Finance auto reporter Pras Subramanian here with me at the desk. Pras, all of this has to do with Twitter. Remember when Elon Musk said that he wouldn't sell just to buy Twitter? What happened?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, he said that, and he also said he wouldn't be selling anymore planned share sales, but I guess those plans have changed. Last night, we were following these late night filings from selling on three different days 7.9 million shares, almost $7 billion in Tesla stock there.

As Elon said in a tweet later last night, in the event that Twitter forces this deal to come to a close and some equity partners don't come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock. So Elon was able to sell this stock at a newer kind of recent high for Tesla, around $900 a share. So he didn't sell it at the absolute low, so he did get some value there.

But it does kind of makes you question what's happening here. Does Elon think the case is actually going to go against him when it starts on October 17? Is Twitter going to be forcing him to buy the company at the end of this, or at least, pay a big settlement? I guess the concern here for Elon Musk and Tesla shareholders.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: So given this context, then, what should we make of this? Obviously, the trial itself doesn't even start until October. Between now and then, what are you keeping an eye on with Tesla?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I think a lot of analysts and shareholders are just concerned about, is the overhang finally gone, or is it still going to remain? Is he going to have to sell again to raise more money to potentially pay for a possible Twitter buy? Apparently, he's-- since November, he sold around $30 to $40 billion in Tesla stock. It seems like that would be enough, but we're not sure yet.

Story continues

So I think it's just more of a concern. Again, is it going to weigh on the stock? Is it going to weigh on management as more and more people like Larry Ellison, for instance, got drawn into a subpoena there. So the question is how much time and money does this waste for Elon Musk when he really needs to execute as the second half of 2020 rolls on.

AKIKO FUJITA: Well, on that front, we have seen investors express some concern, right? I mean, especially when all of this has been-- all as in Elon Musk and Twitter, this being aired out publicly, sort of investors wondering, well, is he actually distracted from the task at hand for Tesla? The share sell itself, how do you think Tesla investors look at it? And what are they ultimately watching as we go into that October date?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Look at some of the commentary last night. Some-- it's between two camps, right? Oh, he's selling. He's finally done. The overhang is gone. The next level for Tesla is 1,000 bucks, let's say, or now it's going to split, right? The other side of it is the concern over whether the share sales are actually over. What's next? Are we going to see more downward pressure on the stock once that share-- that split happens again?

So I think that's-- you're seeing two camps there with Tesla investors. And this also a stock that's very heavy from a retail ownership point of view. It's about 40% retail stock ownership, so not so much heavily with the institution. So you have more of the kind of hot money coming in and out there with retail investors.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: And then, Pras, in terms of other headwinds, obviously, Tesla having a slowdown in China with its sales there. And also, we saw Elon Musk saying, look, if inflation starts to tick down, he'll bring down the price of Tesla's. How do you see that all playing out?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: He said in the past that he's actually embarrassed by the price increases they've had to actually impose because of the fact that these components prices were going up so much. But I think that looking forward, that China shutdown was a temporary thing in July in order to retool the factory to actually improve production.

So I think the second half of the year could be pretty good for them in terms of production because you have not only Shanghai more up to speed, but Berlin and also Giga Austin are probably going to improve or increase their production, too. So it's probably going to be a good production kind of second half for the year, all these distractions aside.",2022-08-10T20:02:07+00:00,2022-08-10

335,Musk Says Twitter Hiding Witnesses He Needs in Buyout Fight,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk is accusing Twitter Inc. of hiding key witnesses in their legal battle over whether he must consummate a $44 billion buyout of the company, according to people familiar with the allegations.

Musk Sells Another $6.9 Billion of Tesla Ahead of Twitter Trial US Inflation Runs Cooler Than Forecast, Easing Pressure on Fed Russia Is Scouring the Globe for Weapons to Use Against Ukraine Dozens in China Infected With New ‘Langya’ Virus Carried by Shrews UK Plans for Blackouts in January in Emergency Energy Plan

Musk contends the social media company isn’t producing the names of employees specifically responsible for evaluating how much of Twitter’s customer base is made up of spam and robot accounts, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

Musk’s lawyers have asked the judge in the case to force Twitter to identify the workers so the defense can get their records and question them, the people said.

A letter asking Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick to compel Twitter to hand over the names was filed Tuesday under seal. Under the court’s rules, Twitter’s attorneys have five business days to decide what should be redacted from the filing as proprietary information.

A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on the filing.

Tesla Share Sale

The letter comes as the Tesla Inc. co-founder said Tuesday he is selling $6.9 billion of Tesla shares to avoid a sudden sale in the event he is forced to go ahead with the deal to acquire Twitter. That has prompted some analysts to predict the billionaire may settle the case.

So far Twitter has handed over the names of “records custodians,” who aren’t as familiar with the data at issue, the people said. Musk wants McCormick to force Twitter to come up with the names of the employees charged with monitoring those accounts, they said.

Story continues

Both sides have issued a torrent of subpoenas to banks, investors and lawyers involved in the teetering transaction as they seek ammunition for an Oct. 17 trial.

“It’s another salvo in the discovery wars that are common in this kind of litigation,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who specializes in securities and merger and acquisition law. “Both sides are jockeying for position by targeting different information.”

War of the Bots

Twitter’s lawyers say they’ll need only four days in court to prove Musk is using questions about spam and bot accounts as a pretext to walk away from the deal. The company said it has turned over all its information about those accounts and that it intends to make Musk pay the $54.20 per share he originally agreed to.

Musk counters in court filings that Twitter’s handover of the that material hasn’t been robust and that the company has failed to produce evidence that spam bots account for fewer than 5% of its active users, as it has said in regulatory filings. He argues this gives him a legitimate basis for canceling the buyout.

He alleges Twitter’s disclosures show that the actual number of monetizable daily active users, or mDAU as the industry calls it, is 65 million less than the 238 million Twitter has claimed. He says Twitter also misrepresents how many of those users view advertising, the company’s main source of revenue. By his estimate, fewer than 16 million users see the majority of ads and should be counted as monetizable.

The case is Twitter v. Musk, 22-0613, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

336,Musk seeks to question Twitter employees who count bots - source,"By Sheila Dang

(Reuters) - Elon Musk's legal team is demanding Twitter turn over the names of employees responsible for calculating what percentage of the social media site's users are bot and spam accounts, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Bot and spam accounts on Twitter have become a central issue in the legal fight over whether Musk, who is Tesla's chief executive, must complete his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company.

Musk said last month he was terminating the deal because Twitter has withheld information about these accounts. Twitter sued Musk to complete the deal, and has said the issue has no bearing on the agreement with Musk.

An Oct. 17 trial is scheduled in Delaware.

In a letter filed under seal on Tuesday, Musk's lawyers asked the judge overseeing the case to compel Twitter to hand over the employee names so that the defense team can question them, the source said.

Bloomberg first reported the request by Musk's lawyers.

A lawyer for Musk declined to comment. Twitter did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Higher-than anticipated revenues in the Americas and Asia Pacific segments and a rise in operating income in the Americas segment buoyed the results. The bottom line increased 43.7% from the year-ago figure of 32 cents.

The company registered net revenues of $5,212 million, surging 31% on a year-over-year basis, which marked the highest second-quarter revenues in a decade, riding on robust selling prices, volume growth and the addition of Cooper Tire. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,070 million.

In the reported quarter, tire volume was 45.6 million units, up 21% from the year-ago period. Replacement tire shipments increased 23%, benefiting from the buyout of Cooper Tire. Original equipment unit volume increased 17% year over year, also benefiting from the buyout of Cooper Tire and business growth.

Segmental Performance

In the reported quarter, the Americas segment generated revenues of $3,147 million, around 40% higher than the prior-year period’s figure and topped the consensus metric of $2,990 million. The segment registered an operating income of $293 million, increasing 25.7% and exceeding the consensus mark of $274 million. Improvements in price/mix and the Cooper Tire merger aided the upswing in operating margins.

Revenues in the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment were $1,497 million, rising 22% from the year-ago period. However, the figure missed the consensus mark of $1,504 million. The segment’s operating profit came in at $52 million in the quarter, an increase of around 21% driven by price mix and higher volumes. Nonetheless, the figure lagged the consensus mark of $62 million.

Revenues in the Asia Pacific segment increased 15% year over year to $568 million and crossed the consensus mark of $566 million. The segment’s operating profit income was $19 million, down 17.4% from the year-ago figure, owing to high raw material costs and inflationary pressure. The figure also lagged the consensus metric of $30.97 million.

Financial Position

Selling, general & administrative expenses flared up to $717 million from $658 million in the year-ago period.

Goodyear had cash and cash equivalents of $1,248 million as of Jun 30, 2022, up from $1,088 million on Dec 31, 2021. As of the second quarter of 2022, long-term debt and finance leases amounted to $7,569 million, up from $6,648 million on Dec 31, 2021. Capital expenditure in the quarter was $235 million, up from $200 million in the year-ago quarter.

Outlook

For the third quarter of 2022, the company anticipates continued volume growth in EMEA and the Asia Pacific segments. Raw material costs are expected to rise nearly $1.0 billion in the second half of 2022 year over year. Inflationary trends are anticipated to persist, especially in transportation, labor and energy costs in the third quarter. Operating results are also likely to be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation by $25 million to $30 million in the third quarter due to the strength of the U.S. dollar at current spot rates.

In 2022, the company expects to reinvest around $300 million in working capital to rebuild inventory levels to meet customer demand and support service levels. Capital expenditure is expected to be in the range of $1.1-$1.2 billion.

345,The 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks to Buy Now,"For several reasons, now is a very good time to buy the best-emerging markets stocks. First of all, the current strength of the dollar increases the profits of foreign companies that sell their products, directly or indirectly, to American consumers and/or companies.

Secondly, many companies in emerging markets are benefiting from the energy transition, the rise of electric vehicles, and other, ongoing solid trends.

Also worth noting is that, with supply chains improving and signs of inflation easing in America, hyperinflation is becoming less of a threat for the best-emerging markets’ stocks. Those equities, like most stocks around the world, should benefit significantly from investors’ recently increased optimism about the U.S. economy.

Finally, I believe that a permanent, compelling feature of emerging-market names is that it’s much easier to find relatively undiscovered, “diamond-in-the-rough” stocks when you incorporate emerging markets into your search.

Best Emerging Markets Stocks: Vale (VALE) the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background

A Brazil-based mining company, Vale (NYSE:VALE) is very well-positioned to benefit from the coming rebound of the U.S. and Chinese economies, the EV revolution, the recovery of automobile supply chains, and the strong demand for solar panels and wind turbines.

Vale generates most of its revenue from iron ore, which, of course, is used to make steel. The recovery of auto supply chains should lead to the construction of more vehicles, while pent-up demand for air travel is likely to increase the demand for new planes significantly. Both of those trends should greatly increase the demand for steel and, consequently, meaningfully lift Vale’s iron ore sales.

The company also produces copper, which is used in EV batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines. Finally, the company sells nickel, which is also used to make EV batteries.

Despite all of these positive catalysts, the forward price-earnings ratio of VALE stock is a measly 3.5.

Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), a Chinese search engine and tech giant, was never one of the main targets of the country’s regulators during the tech crackdown. And Beijing appears to be putting the brakes on that initiative, for now at least.

What’s more, China’s anti-coronavirus measures are also being relaxed, and the country is looking to use “effective investment” to boost its economy.

“The second-largest search engine globally,” Baidu is becoming the world’s leading robotaxi operator. The company’s robotaxi business in China is operating in “10 cities and [has completed] over 500,000 rides across three quarters.”

Seeking Alpha contributor Mobility Matters Research recently estimated that, “by 2030,” the business could generate $1.6B in annual revenue. ”

Eventually, Baidu could bring its robotaxi business to many other countries. However, the forward price-earnings ratio of BIDU stock is slightly under 20. That’s a very attractive valuation, given its powerful search engine and its leadership in the robotaxi sector.

Business is booming for BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), which Investor’s Business Daily recently called “the biggest Chinese EV maker, [and] arguably the biggest EV maker in the world.”

In July, the company’s EV sales soared 222% year-over-year, reaching a record 162,350. And its Q2 sales growth was also extremely impressive. Last quarter, its unit sales jumped an incredible 256% YOY and 24% versus Q1 to 355,000. BYD sold 100,000 more EVs than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in Q1, and Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) has a 7.7% stake in BYD.

The Chinese company is looking to expand its EV business to many more countries, and it also has a large EV battery business, enabling it to benefit from the EV boom in more ways than one.

As another InvestorPlace columnist, Alex Sirois, recently pointed out, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) “is rapidly growing and improving” as its Q1 revenue came in at $2.02 billion “up from $528.5 million a year prior.”

Sirois noted that: “Lithium sales accounted for $1.45 billion of its revenue” in Q1, so Sociedad is as much of a pure play on lithium as you’ll find. Of course, given the rapid acceleration of the EV revolution, the demand for lithium is poised to remain incredibly strong for the foreseeable future.

What’s more, the lithium miner is very profitable, as its Q1 net income came in at a very impressive $796 million in Q1, while its EBITDA margin, excluding certain items, was nearly 59%. SQM’s Q1 results “reflect… the impact of higher prices in all our business lines, where significant increases in lithium prices stand out,” said CEO Ricardo Ramos in a statement included in its Q1 earnings press release.

In 2021, Sociedad generated $973 million of operating income, up from $375 in 2020 and $442 million in 2019.

The reaction of JinkoSolar’s (NASDAQ:JKS) stock to the passing of the Democrats’ budget bill has been more subdued than that of many other names in the sector.

It appears that investors are worried that the company will be hurt by the generous manufacturing tax credits in the bill that will be restricted to firms with U.S.-based plants.

But China-based Jinko has a large plant in Florida that it can easily expand. And as one of the largest solar panel makers in the world, Jinko is poised to benefit from tremendous demand for solar energy in many other regions, including India, the EU, and, of course, China.

Also worth noting is that the price of all of the panels that Jinko sells in the U.S. will be reduced because of the extension of the investment tax credit for solar within the budget. Additionally, Jinko makes some of the most efficient solar modules in the industry, enabling it to easily prevail against companies offering cheaper panels.

PBR stock recently received a nearly perfect composite score of 99 from Investor’s Business Daily, and the shares have an incredibly high forward dividend yield of nearly 45%.

Although oil prices could easily continue dropping going forward due to a variety of factors, including the EV revolution and a possible cease-fire in Ukraine,  the stock’s tiny forward price-earnings ratio of 3.4, along with, its huge dividend yield, more than offset any possible declines in oil prices.

Its overall revenue climbed 8% YOY to $9 billion, while its EBITDA margin jumped two percentage points YOY to 6.1%.

“The CV industry continued to witness rising demand across all segments led by a reviving economy. With the sequential easing of semiconductor shortage and our ramp-up agility, Tata Motors delivered a strong quarter,” said the company’s executive director, Girish Wagh.

346,‘One of the most dangerous and irresponsible actions by a car company in decades’: Activist Ralph Nader urges regulators to recall Tesla’s self-driving technology,"The man who forever changed vehicle safety standards in the U.S. has a scathing new message for Elon Musk and Tesla’s self-driving car technology: He thinks it’s dangerous, and regulators should get involved.

Musk has been touting self-driving cars as the next big thing for years, saying in 2015 that autonomous vehicles would be on the road within two years. While that timeline hasn’t come to fruition, Musk has not yet given up on his dream, nor has he tempered his ambitions. In May 2022, he stated that full self-driving (FSD) cars should be available by the same time next year.

But Musk’s big goal to accelerate the deployment of self-driving cars has not been without controversy. Now, Ralph Nader, four-time presidential candidate and a forefather of modern vehicle safety standards, has made his view on FSD vehicles clear.

Nader has called Tesla employing FSD systems in its cars “one of the most dangerous and irresponsible actions by a car company in decades” and that Tesla should “never have put this technology in its vehicles,” in a statement released Wednesday on his personal website.

He also urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to recall FSD technology from every Tesla vehicle in circulation.

“I am calling on federal regulators to act immediately to prevent the growing deaths and injuries from Tesla manslaughtering crashes with this technology,” he wrote.

Tesla did not immediately reply to Fortune’s request for comment.

A powerful adversary

Nader has long been one of the most influential figures in the American automotive industry.

He has been both a celebrity and a pariah for carmakers ever since 1965, when he published his bestselling book Unsafe at Any Speed, a scathing look at the automobile manufacturing industry and its refusal to implement and recommend safety features such as seat belts, airbags, and antilock brakes.

Nader’s book called for more government oversight of manufacturers and stricter regulation of vehicle safety standards, eventually leading to the formation of the federal agency that would become the NHTSA, a group that describes its mission as “save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce economic costs due to road traffic crashes.”

Story continues

For his contributions to vehicle safety, Nader was even inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2016.

Self-driving controversy

Despite the delays in bringing self-driving cars to market, Musk is still convinced that the technology will become a crucial component of Tesla’s business.

“The overwhelming focus is solving full self-driving,” Musk said during an interview last June. “That’s essential, and that’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.”

But Nader’s criticisms of automated vehicles are only the latest in a string of doubts and obstacles for Tesla’s FSD ambitions, as owners have reported that the vehicles have been known to brake on highways without reason, while others have said the cars have faulty sensors causing them to unexpectedly come to a full stop and misidentify objects on the road.

Tesla’s self-driving cars have been the subject of an NHTSA investigation since last year, when the agency opened a “preliminary evaluation” over 11 reported crashes caused by Tesla vehicles equipped with its Autopilot or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control features. The accidents injured 17 people and killed one woman.

Last June, the agency upgraded its investigation to an “engineering analysis” status, which will open the company and the Autopilot system to a higher level of scrutiny. At the time, the NHTSA said it was investigating as many as 35 crashes that occurred with Autopilot engaged, including nine fatal ones leading to 14 deaths, the New York Times reported. The agency clarified that it has not confirmed whether these accidents were directly the result of Autopilot defects.

Also in June, the NHTSA announced that it had received 400 crash reports in the past 10 months involving vehicles with FSD systems, of which 273 were Teslas.

In his statement, Nader urged the public to get the government involved and called for stricter regulation of the use of FSD in Tesla’s vehicles.

“Together we need to send an urgent message to the casualty-minded regulators that Americans must not be test dummies for a powerful, high-profile corporation and its celebrity CEO. No one is above the laws of manslaughter,” he wrote.

348,"Two lawmakers ask U.S. regulator about Tesla crashes, safety probes","By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers who chair subcommittees overseeing auto safety asked the federal auto safety regulator for a briefing on its probes into crashes involving Tesla Inc electric vehicles using Autopilot and advanced driver assistance systems, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

U.S. Senator Gary Peters and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, said in the letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) they were concerned that ""federal investigations and recent reporting have uncovered troubling safety issues"" at Tesla.

The lawmakers asked ""given the mounting number of fatalities involving Tesla vehicles crashing into tractor trailers ... has NHTSA considered opening a defect investigation into this issue?""

The letter added ""does NHTSA strike a balance between investigative thoroughness and addressing urgent, emerging risks to motor vehicle safety?"" and if the agency has enough resources and legal authority to properly investigate advanced driver assistance systems.

NHTSA did not immediately comment. In July, NHTSA Administrator Steve Cliff told Reuters he wanted to complete the investigation into Tesla's advanced driver assistance system Autopilot ""as quickly as we possibly can but I also want to get it right. There's a lot of information that we need to comb through.""

Tesla, which has disbanded its press office, did not immediately comment. Tesla's website says that Autopilot enables vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically and ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

Since 2016, NHTSA has opened 38 special investigations of crashes involving Tesla vehicles and where advanced driver assistance systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used. A total of 19 crash deaths have been reported in those Tesla-related investigations.

Last month, NHTSA said it opened a special investigation into the crash of a 2020 Tesla Model 3 vehicle that killed a motorcyclist in Utah.

Story continues

In June, NHTSA upgraded its defect investigation into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with Autopilot involving crashes into parked emergency vehicles, a required step before it could seek a recall. That investigation was first launched in August 2021.

On June 15, NHTSA said Tesla reported 273 vehicle crashes since July 2021 involving advanced driving assistance systems, more than any other automaker.

The lawmakers asked if NHTSA has determined whether Tesla has implemented safeguards to prevent advanced driver assistance systems ""from being activated when the vehicle is not within the appropriate operating conditions?""

The National Transportation Safety Board and others have questioned if Tesla is doing enough to ensure drivers pay attention while using Autopilot.

""Has any NHTSA investigation found that a design which allows the operation of an ADAS in circumstances it is not designed for constitutes a defect?"" the lawmakers wrote, using the acronym for advanced driver assistance systems.

In July, NHTSA Administrator Steve Cliff told Reuters he wanted to complete the investigation into Tesla's advanced driver assistance system Autopilot ""as quickly as we possibly can but I also want to get it right. There's a lot of information that we need to comb through.""

Tesla, which has disbanded its press office, did not immediately comment. Tesla's website says that Autopilot enables vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically and ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""

Since 2016, NHTSA has opened 38 special investigations of crashes involving Tesla vehicles and where advanced driver assistance systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used. A total of 19 crash deaths have been reported in those Tesla-related investigations.

Last month, NHTSA said it opened a special investigation into the crash of a 2020 Tesla Model 3 vehicle that killed a motorcyclist in Utah.

In June, NHTSA upgraded its defect investigation into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with Autopilot involving crashes into parked emergency vehicles, a required step before it could seek a recall. That investigation was first launched in August 2021.

On June 15, NHTSA said Tesla reported 273 vehicle crashes since July 2021 involving advanced driving assistance systems, more than any other automaker.

The lawmakers asked if NHTSA has determined whether Tesla has implemented safeguards to prevent advanced driver assistance systems ""from being activated when the vehicle is not within the appropriate operating conditions?""

The National Transportation Safety Board and others have questioned if Tesla is doing enough to ensure drivers pay attention while using Autopilot.

""Has any NHTSA investigation found that a design which allows the operation of an ADAS in circumstances it is not designed for constitutes a defect?"" the lawmakers wrote, using the acronym for advanced driver assistance systems.

350,Rivian earnings preview: Why one metric will be key,"When EV maker Rivian (RIVN) releases its second quarter financial report tonight after the bell, all eyes will be on one key metric.

Like Tesla, Lucid, and even GM and Ford before it, investors are keenly watching what Rivian CEO RJ Scraringe and team will say about the company’s annual production forecast, currently sitting at 25,000 vehicles for the year.

In Q1 of this year Rivian produced 2,553 vehicles, and in Q2 the company revealed it produced 4,401 vehicles, a healthy jump in production. Given those numbers, Rivian will need to make around 19,000 trucks in the second half of the year to meet its 2022 forecast, which could be a stretch for a company still trying to ramp up its production capabilities.

Some on Wall Street are bullish heading into the report. “The performance last quarter coupled with the 2Q delivery numbers show that Rivian (and the management team) is finally starting to get their act together and live up to some of the massive hype for the company,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note today.

Turning to the balance sheet and key financial metrics, the Street is looking for Rivan to report $335.7 million of revenue, with an adjusted EPS loss of $1.61. This would equal an adjusted net income loss of $1.52 billion for the quarter.

Looking beyond Q2, any commentary on production capacity at the factory in Normal, Illinois or preorder information regarding the R1T and R1S trucks (90K as of last quarter) will also be welcome news. R.J. Scaringe, Rivian's 35-year-old CEO, introduces his company's R1T all-electric pickup and all-electric R1S SUV at Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 27, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Yahoo Finance has also confirmed that Rivian is now having preorder reservation holders to sign binding purchase agreements in order to preserve the current $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing an EV. Under the current wording of the Inflation Reduction Act, which may get a House vote later this week, many Rivian orders would be disqualified due to MSRPs above $80,000, or potential buyers being disqualified if their adjusted gross income tops a certain threshold. Rivian’s management team will likely be asked about this new order process on the call.

Story continues

Other items of note in the quarterly report and on the call afterwards is whether Scaringe and management have anything more to say about the recent layoffs at the company, which affected 6% of the workforce and if Rivian is still plagued by component and chip shortages. In the call following last quarter’s earnings report, Scaringe said Rivian had seen “the worst of the supply constraints,” indicating the situation might be improving.

Rivian shares are trading higher today, but are down a considerable 63% year to date.

352,7 Reddit Stocks to Buy on the Dip,"Investors looking to understand the overall picture around Reddit stocks should consider ApeWisdom. The website tracks trends surrounding popular stocks that are gaining or already have lots of traction on the aggregation and discussion social media platform. So, it’s a great first stop when considering which Reddit stocks to buy on the dip.

It really depends on the risk tolerance of the individual who uses Reddit for investment advice, but these stocks can be a mixed bag. Speculation is rampant on the site. That means risk-tolerant investors can easily find riskier picks on the site.

But at the same time, there is plenty of more moderate advice to be found as well. That’s mostly what is included in this list, because predicting the next AMTD Digital (NYSE:HKD) is exceedingly difficult. That said, here are seven Reddit stocks to buy on the dip.

TSLA Tesla $874.16 AA Alcoa $54.43 AAPL Apple $169.68 AMD Advanced Micro Devices $100.09 ON ON Semiconductor $66.96 PYPL PayPal $100.39 OXY Occidental Petroleum $65.24

It’s fairly easy to construct a positive narrative around Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock whenever it falters. So, although Tesla is down 25% year-to-date (YTD), plenty of bullishness remains.

The electric vehicle (EV) pioneer has proven masterful at remaining top-of-mind. Company leadership is doing what it should be given share prices are part science and part art. Elon Musk is always in the spotlight, and that keeps Tesla prices high to a degree.

Investors should also remain optimistic about TSLA stock on the news that shareholders are behind a 3-for-1 stock split based on early voting. A split would be the second of its kind in two years if successful. The last split resulted in a tripling in share price, so investors are likely to be behind this one as well.

Further, Musk recently stated Tesla will require roughly a dozen factories in order to meet its annual sales goal of 20 million vehicles by 2030. All signs point to serious growth ahead.

Alcoa (AA) alcola stock

Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is a commodity stock representing a firm that produces bauxite, alumina and aluminum products. It presents an opportunity to buy a company that is growing steadily, yet hasn’t been immune to macrotrends.

Company-wide revenues increased per the most recent earnings report. In fact, revenue grew nearly 29% in the second quarter while net income rose by more than 76%, reaching $496 million in the quarter.

But the problem is that sequential results may be scaring investors away. Alcoa’s revenues increased from $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion between the first and second quarters this year. However, net income decreased from $577 million to $496 million.

Investors are shying away from shares based on that fact. But for buyers who understand sequential results don’t make for an apples-to-apples comparison, the opportunity is obvious.

At the end of the day, Alcoa is performing extraordinarily well and has met or exceeded guidance in each of the last four quarters.

In some sense, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has already beaten the dip. The firm’s July 28 earnings report proved to be better than expected. Apple reported $83 billion in sales and earnings per share, or EPS, of $1.20 while Wall Street had been expecting $82.8 billion and $1.16, respectively.

Those strong results were bolstered by iPhone sales that totaled $40.7 billion. It wasn’t all rosy, however, as Mac sales fell short of their $8.7 billion goal, reaching $7.4 billion.

Overall, the news was strong, as Apple set a June quarter revenue record. The company returned $28 billion to its shareholders during the quarter as well.

Further, Apple generated $23 billion in operating cash flow, which suggests it will have no problem financing its growth objectives, including bringing chip manufacturing in-house for iPhones. There’s a strong case to be made that Apple is the best tech stock available at this time.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is primarily known as a semiconductor supplier to the computer industry and data centers.

Investors are stumbling to make sense of recent news as the company sees a weakening personal computer market. Despite the fact that AMD derives much of its business from that sector and predicts a slowdown, the company has not slashed its full-year outlook. That is in sharp contrast to rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).

Investors should understand AMD is doing well despite the broader macro environment. Revenue increased 70% following AMD’s long-awaited acquisition of Xilinx. That acquisition did, however, lead to net income decreasing 37% in the quarter.

The bullish narrative is that a reinvigorated AMD, bolstered by Xilinx’s strength in FPGA chips, looks much stronger moving forward and is better able to capture important markets.

ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) stock represents a rapidly-growing, profitable chipmaker involved in several important sectors.

The company has a strong presence in the automotive sector and is particularly notable for its position in relation to EVs. And while it benefits from secular trends around that burgeoning industry, its current performance should really attract investors.

The company just recorded its first-ever quarter with revenues in excess of $2 billion, representing a 25% increase on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. Firm profits increased from $184.1 million to $455.8 million in the same period.

The company is currently benefiting from strong auto demand, so ON stock is ideal for investors seeking a stock to capitalize on that trend. It also expects to record revenues exceeding $2 billion in the coming quarter.

There’s lots of good news surrounding PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock currently. For one, the pioneering fintech firm did better than expected in Q2. Perhaps most importantly, PayPal’s Q2 earnings exceeded analyst expectations.

Shares lost massive value in 2022 and the company had to revise guidance downward earlier in the year. Prices tumbled and had the market wondering if PayPal was on a path to irrelevance as the market tightens.

The earnings beat eased a lot of that worry. PayPal also revealed a $15 billion share buyback plan which should serve to ease investor worries even more.

PYPL stock is unlikely to rebound to the high-$200 price range it tested in late 2021. But there is still plenty of upside from its current $99 price point. There are signs the tech wreck has turned a corner. If that’s true, PayPal is at a great entry point.

Reddit Stock to Buy on the Dip: Occidental Petroleum (OXY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.

Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock saw an uptick in interest through Q2 as Warren Buffett’s firm bought heavily in June and July. That had many investors interested in the oil extraction firm.

Buffett was proven correct as Occidental Petroleum topped estimates in the quarter on strong commodity prices. The reason to like OXY stock moving forward is the company maneuvered deftly this quarter. It used those higher-than-anticipated profits to pay down a whopping 19% of outstanding debts.

That’s a textbook Buffett play. Additionally, the company repurchased $1.1 billion of its shares in the quarter, proving it rewards shareholders who believe in it. In short, energy stocks will remain volatile, but OXY stock is operating a fundamentally smart business with long-term value in mind.

We'll also review Philippe Laffont's top 10 stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion about Philippe Laffont's investment philosophy and portfolio management strategies and jump directly to Philippe Laffont’s Top 5 Stock Picks.

Coatue Management avoided significant losses in the first-half tech stock bloodbath, thanks to Philippe Laffont's decision to liquidate a large portion of his investment firm’s portfolio and keep 80% of its assets in cash. Laffont is well known for having a knack for predicting crises, selling positions, making significant changes to a portfolio to avoid losses, and using that cash to invest in new opportunities. In the dot-com bubble and during the great financial crisis, the tiger cub's portfolio was comprised of 40% to 80% cash. Coatue's secret presentation to investors pointed out that markets are likely to face a massive selloff in the future, similar to the collapse of the dot-com bubble in 2000. The presentation shows that the tech stock selloff that has pushed the NASDAQ index into bear territory in the first half of 2022 is currently in its second phase, with the final phase to come, one that could be even more brutal than the past two.

According to the presentation, in 2021, unprofitable and low-quality companies were slaughtered in the first phase of the share price collapse, similar to 2000. In the second phase, all tech companies got hammered in the first half of 2022, which is similar to what happened in the second phase of the dot-com-related price collapse, which lasted from December 2000 to March 2001. And in the final phase of the dot-com burst, companies from all sectors collapsed and the selloff lasted for almost a year. In the firm's analysis, the current market is headed towards that final stage, when recession-driven earnings revisions and lower forecasts will cause broader market declines. According to the firm, investors should be aware of bear market rallies. Three bear market rallies occurred from June 2000 to June 2001, followed by sharp selloffs.

Preparing Shopping List

The tech-focused investment firm is pessimistic about the market but believes some risks are worth taking with an eye on long-term returns. In order to reinvest its whopping cash pile, the firm is preparing a shopping list of 40 stocks. Based on the presentation, Philippe Laffont’s Coatue is interested in buying profitable tech stocks that were unfairly knocked down by the broader market selloff. In addition, the firm is optimistic about non-profitable tech stocks that could grow and become profitable in the future. This is determined by factors such as incremental margins, unit economics, and top-level management. Non-profitable tech stocks like DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) and Snowflake, Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) are members of Laffont’s shopping list. For large-cap stocks, the firm has high expectations for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

13F Portfolio and Philippe Laffont’s Top Stock Picks

Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management has been making substantial changes to its 13F stock portfolio over the past several quarters. Coatue sold 35 stocks in the March quarter and reduced its stake in 18 positions. On the other hand, the firm initiated a position in 12 stocks and added to 18 of its existing positions. As of the end of March, Coatue Management held $13.6 billion in assets in its 13F securities portfolio. Philippe Laffont's top 10 stock picks include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc.

Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management

Our Methodology:

We made use of Coatue Management’s 13F portfolio for this analysis. Below is the list of Philippe Laffont’s top 10 stock picks:

Philippe Laffont’s Top 10 Stock Picks

10. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)

Coatue Management’s stake value: $524 million

Percetage of portfolio: 3.83%

Number of hedge fund holders: 163

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and SQ Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) are among the top holdings of Philippe Laffont’s firm, which also initiated a stake in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) during the final quarter of 2021, when its shares plunged from a 52-week high of $250.

In the March quarter of 2022, the firm raised its stake in the financial technology company by 5% to 3.83% portfolio weightng. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is one of the best stocks to hold for the long-term amid given its dividend factor and solid business model. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has raised its dividend payments each of the last 13 years and its dividend growth rate has averaged around 17% over the past five years. In addition to the dividend factor, shares of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) are poised to grow in the long term, supported by its potential to generate sustainable growth in revenue and earnings. In the June quarter of 2022, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) topped Wall Street’s revenue and earnings expectations by $230 million and $0.23 per share, respectively. With June quarter payments volumes up 12% and cross-border volumes up 40%, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) continues to see strong growth.

In its first quarter investor letter, Polen Capital, an investment management firm, expressed confidence in the future fundamentals of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Here is what the firm stated about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):

“We added to both Visa and Mastercard during the final quarter of 2021, based on the belief that both businesses were trading at attractive prices and poised to deliver, double-digit returns over the next three to five years. Cross-border transactions–a highly profitable business segment for both companies–represent roughly 10% of Visa and Mastercard’s volumes and 25% of their gross revenues, so lockdowns have severely impacted this segment due to stifled travel. While it was impossible to know when people would begin traveling again, we accepted this reality with the belief that travel would eventually return. Both companies have commented that as soon as a country or geography reopens, cross-border volumes reignite, amplifying each business’s growth and profitability. We think these near-term headwinds have created an attractive long-term investment opportunity.”

9. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Coatue Management’s stake value: $539 million

Percetage of portfolio: 3.94%

Number of hedge fund holders: 109

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the long-running members of Philippe Laffont’s top 10 stock picks list. His firm first initiated a position in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in 2012. In the March quarter of 2022, the firm raised its existing stake in the company by 55% to capitalize on the share price selloff. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is among the hardest hit companies in the past couple of quarters due to concerns over slower growth in the post-pandemic environment.

Shares of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) are currently trading around $200, down significantly from the all-time high of $700 that they hit late in 2021. The shares gained some momentum recently after Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) posted better than expected June quarter results and issued solid guidance. In the second quarter, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) lost 0.97 million net global paid subscribers compared to Wall Street’s expectations for a loss of 2 million subscribers. In addition, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) expects to add 1 million new subscribers in the third quarter of 2022.

In its second quarter investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an investment management firm, mentioned a few stocks, including Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Here is what the firm stated about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).

“Netflix‘s stock price was down considerably after providing a weaker than expected outlook for both subscriber growth and profit margins. After meeting with management and scrutinizing our investment thesis, we lowered our estimate of business value to account for the company’s softer near-term guidance. However, we believe the decline in the company’s share price more than adjusts for this. Indeed, Netflix now trades for a discount to the S&P 500 Index on next year’s GAAP earnings despite our view that the company remains a much better than average business run by a highly accomplished management team. We believe the company’s lead in streaming remains intact and we expect terminal operating margins to be substantially higher than they are today. Furthermore, we are encouraged by Netflix’s potential to enhance revenue growth through advertising, the monetization of password sharing and further penetrating international markets.”

8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Coatue Management’s stake value: $592 million

Percetage of portfolio: 4.33%

Number of hedge fund holders: 262

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best-performing large-cap tech stocks in recent years and ranks seventh on the list of Philippe Laffont’s top 10 stock picks. Like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also one of the solid tech stocks to hold for the long term.

Shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been under pressure year to date due to the broader market selloff and lofty valuations. However, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to generate robust financial growth despite slowing revenue trends in the tech industry. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects to generate double-digit revenue and operating income growth for 2022. For the June quarter, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) posted revenue of $51.9 billion, representing a 12% growth from the past year's period.

In the fund's first quarter investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an investment management firm, highlighted a few stocks including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Here is what the firm stated about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT):

“Stock selection contributed the most while sector allocation was also positive. An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported positive results driven by personal computing strength, but analysts were especially positive on its growth outlook for its Azure cloud-computing services.”

7. Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)

Coatue Management’s stake value: $603 million

Percetage of portfolio: 4.41%

Number of hedge fund holders: 81

Coatue Management has been holding a stake in Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) since its public debut in 2020. However, the firm lowered its stake in Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) from 5.24 million shares at the beginning of 2021 to 2.1 million shares by the end of the year. In the march quarter of 2022, the firm again started increasing its stake in Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), apparently seeking to take advantage of the sharp stock price selloff. Shares of Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) are down around 50% since the beginning of this year.

In its presentation to investors, Coatue Management also highlighted its interest in Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). Unlike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) doesn't offer dividends. Therefore, only value and growth investors are likely to consider Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW).

In its second quarter investor, ClearBridge Investments, an investment management firm, mentioned a few stocks including Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). Here is what the first stated about Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW):

“Snowflake operates a cloud-based data platform for small and medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers. The company is a key beneficiary of software spending moving to the cloud, as well as the increasing strategic importance of data. With the potential to address the large and growing market for data cloud, a roughly $250 billion plus opportunity by 2026, we see a long runway for growth ahead. Although the company is already profitable, we believe Snowflake still has significant room for free cash flow margin expansion.”

6. DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH)

Coatue Management’s stake value: $618 million

Percentage of portfolio: 4.52%

Number of hedge fund holders: 52

Like Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) is another non-profitable tech stock Philippe Laffont is buying after the stock's massive share price collapse. Shares of DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) are down close to 45% since the beginning of the year due to a broader market selloff.

The San Francisco-based online delivery platform posted 29.8% revenue growth for the June quarter compared to last year, which helped ease fears about slowing online delivery demand during a post-pandemic era. DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) expects to sustain its revenue growth momentum for the rest of 2022 despite slowing economic growth. Coatue Management expressed confidence in DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) after its price plunge in the past few quarters, as the firm increased its stake in DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) during the March quarter by 81% to 4.52% of its 13F portfolio weighting.

Like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and SQ Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) is one of the favorite stocks of hedge funds. DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) was in 52 hedge funds' portfolios as of the end of March, up significantly from 40 positions in the previous quarter. Wildcat Capital Management was the leading stakeholder in DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH).

358,"Battery Giants, Hyundai Concerned by US Moves on China Supplies","(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s biggest electric-car battery makers and Hyundai Motor Co. have expressed concern over new US legislation aimed at boosting domestic production of EVs and reducing the use of Chinese materials, moves they say could hurt their competitiveness.

Korean trade ministry officials met with Hyundai Motor, LG Energy Solution Ltd., Samsung SDI Co. and SK On Co. to listen to their “concerns and difficulties” about the measures in the US’s tax and energy bill, the ministry said in a statement Thursday. Chief among these are the need to assemble EVs in North America and to quickly end a reliance on China for the battery supply chain in order for the vehicles to qualify for a maximum $7,500 tax credit.

The concerns, along with a request for the tax-credit requirements to be eased, were conveyed to the US Trade Representative, along with a warning the steps may breach the US-Korea free trade agreement and World Trade Organization rules, a trade ministry spokesman said Friday.

South Korean battery makers source most of their materials from China, and finding new sources could be difficult amid surging demand and short supply. Meanwhile, all the EVs Hyundai currently sells in the US and Europe are made in Korea. The automaker plans to open its first US plant in Georgia in 2025.

Korean battery makers hold around 30% of the global market and supply carmakers including Tesla Inc., General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co., and Rivian Automotive Inc.

The firms are waiting for more details on the US rules and some are already seeking to diversify suppliers outside China, according to people at the four big Korean cell and materials makers, who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. The draft of the legislation still seems to be vague and the thresholds may be adjusted after US carmakers lobby Congress, some of the people said.

“The cost for making batteries will rise as companies will have to spend more on a new supply chain,” said Kim Min-Ji, senior researcher at state-run Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. “It’s not easy to change a metal supplier, and it’s even harder to refine metals at a low cost, which China does, especially in an eco-friendly way.”

South Korean battery makers, which use chemistries like nickel, cobalt, manganese or aluminum, imported more than 80% of the key minerals from China in 2020, according to the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. Japan also imported 80% of its hydroxide lithium and 96% of manganese from China for making batteries, the institute said.

365,US Politicians are Buying These 10 Semiconductor Stocks,"In this article, we discuss the 10 semiconductor stocks that US politicians are buying. If you want to read about some more semiconductor stocks that US politicians are buying, go directly to US Politicians are Buying These 5 Semiconductor Stocks.

The global semiconductor industry has been one of the biggest winners of the rising inflation in the past few months, a problem that has arisen due to a mix of high demand and supply chain problems in the wake of the post-pandemic economic reopening. This boom for chip stocks has slowly started to fade as the central bank embarks on a policy of aggressive rate hikes to curb inflation and the demand for chips in the personal computer industry starts to fall. The sector is still positioned for robust growth and could reach $600 billion in value this year.

According to a report on the sector by research firm Deloitte, the importance of the chip industry to the overall health of the world economy can be judged by the fact that tech giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) often rely on semiconductor manufacturers for supply, and shortages of these chips, which are dirt-cheap compared to the products sold by these firms, have resulted in losses worth $500 billion worldwide in the past two years.

The chip industry has also led to a global trade between superpowers like the United States and China. Chinese firms dominate the chips sector but the US recently announced plans to invest hundreds of billions into the local semiconductor firms to make them more competitive on a global level. US politicians have been buying up stakes in semiconductor stocks this summer in anticipation of this spending. Deloitte estimates that despite a near-term demand slowdown, the industry will still grow 10% in 2022 and become even more critical to the world economy.

Our Methodology

The companies listed below were picked from the Periodic Transaction Report(s) that US Congress members who trade stocks are obliged to file. Companies that operate in the semiconductor sector were preferred for the list. It is important to clarify that the companies were picked from the public record of investments US Congress members and their families have made in the past few months. The purchases may not have been made by the Congress members themselves but only disclosed on behalf of their families. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

US Politicians are Buying These Semiconductor Stocks

10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) supplies semiconductor infrastructure software solutions. US House member Diana Harshbarger on August 2 revealed that she had bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares worth somewhere between $1,000 and $15,000. In the filing, she detailed that the transaction in this regard took place in late June.

On June 29, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya maintained a Buy rating on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock and lowered the price target to $625 from $780, noting that semiconductor downturns happen every few years and one could be due this year.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Cantillon Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), with 1 million shares worth more than $652 million.

Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the stocks that US politicians are trading.

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“However, ClearBridge portfolio companies are responding by supporting their workforces and showing resilience in adapting and thriving. Semiconductor companies ClearBridge owns and engages with have been successful in advancing vaccinations in their global supply chains. In Malaysia, for example, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has taken part in PIKAS, a public-private partnership vaccination program focusing on the workforce in critical manufacturing sectors. By the summer of 2021 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was able to get over 90% of workers in its Penang factory at least one dose of vaccine, and roughly 73% fully vaccinated. Companies in the program also pay the administration cost for vaccinations including cases where the employee is no longer employed by the company before full immunization of the employee.”

9. NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43

NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI) makes and sells various products related to semiconductors. In mid-June, US House member Ro Khanna disclosed in a mandatory filing that his child had bought the shares of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI) worth somewhere around $1,000 and $15,000. The transaction in this regard was disclosed almost a month after it was made in early May.

On July 15, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari maintained a Neutral rating on NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI) stock and lowered the price target to $150 from $181, noting that there was a deterioration in the overall macro operating environment for chip firms.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI), with 923,855 shares worth more than $170 million.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Sound Shore Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Similarly, analog chip supplier NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI) declined even though the company reported above consensus revenue growth. A leading chip maker for infrastructure and automotive applications, we view NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ:NXPI) as a “new industrial,” uniquely positioned to benefit from increased chip content per application/vehicle. This includes electric and autonomous vehicles and more broadly, connectivity and the internet of things. We added the stock to the portfolio during the volatile fourth quarter of 2018 at just 10 times earnings. Today, NXP is still valued at a very reasonable 14 times earnings.”

8. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46

ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) makes and sells advanced semiconductor equipment systems. On July 25, US House member Michael McCaul disclosed a transaction related to ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stock worth somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000. The member revealed that his wife had bought the shares of the firm worth the above mentioned amount in late June.

On July 21, JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande maintained an Overweight rating on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stock and lowered the price target to $794 from $925, appreciating the second quarter earnings results of the firm.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ: ASML), with 4.4 million shares worth more than $2.9 billion.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“During the quarter, we reduced our semiconductor exposure through the trim of ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) to manage concerns of a slowdown due to the risk of double ordering and potential softness in some consumer end markets. We increased our position in IT services with the purchase of Accenture as we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential these companies provide, which is underpinned by the compressed digital transformation cycle, rising cloud adoption and growth in data-driven insights.

Despite the market volatility and hyper focus on rising rates, chief information officer surveys continue to forecast resilience in IT budgets this year. Growth in IT spending for 2022 is expected to remain above the 10-year pre-COVID-19 average, according to Morgan Stanley. We believe this is a result of the strong secular underpinnings brought on by digital transformation and businesses focusing on increasing efficiencies through technology.”

7. KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52

KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) markets process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor industry. In mid-June, US House member Ro Khanna disclosed a transaction related to KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) stock worth somewhere between $1,000 and $15,000. The member revealed that his wife had bought the stock worth the above mentioned amount in late May.

At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 52 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.8 billion in KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), compared to 49 in the previous quarter worth $2.4 billion.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Vltava Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“We then used the money freed up to, among other things, open three new positions. The stock price declines during the Russian invasion brought a lot of good prices to the market. Out of all the possibilities we considered, we picked the stock of KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC).

KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) develops leading-edge equipment and services that enable innovation throughout the electronics industry. It specialises in process management and control in semiconductor manufacturing and the related nano-electronics industries. During manufacturing processes, products must be inspected for defects and correct critical dimensions in order to identify and eliminate possible sources of problems. As customers continue to enforce Moore’s Law, smaller chips must meet more precise specifications, which in turn increases the need for advanced inspection and diagnostic tools. This is a key step within the entire manufacturing process and one in which the company has built a very strong, and in places dominant, global position. We have been watching and waiting for an opportunity to acquire this stock for some time already, and this year’s drop in its price finally prompted us to buy.”

6. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73

QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops and sells foundational technologies for the wireless industry.

366,10 Biggest Digital Currencies in the World,"In this article, we discuss the 10 biggest digital currencies in the world. If you want to read about some more digital cryptocurrencies, go directly to 5 Biggest Digital Currencies in the World.

Soaring inflation and rising interest rates over the past few months have hammered risk assets, resulting in a broad correction in value of several digital currencies. The aggregate market capitalization of the crypto market has more than halved in size from a peak value of over $3 trillion at the end of 2021. Most of this decline can be attributed to the two biggest digital currencies that have had a horrible start to 2022, with Bitcoin down close to 50% year-to-date while Ethereum is down nearly 49%.

In tandem with this crisis for the crypto world, firms which have invested in digital assets, like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), have also witnessed their share prices tumble. The worst, however, seems to be behind the crypto world, as coin prices are showing signs of rallying once again as July inflation data points to slowed gains due to rising inventories and falling energy prices. In the month of July, Bitcoin rallied nearly 20% while Ethereum prices climbed by around 58%.

A slew of bankruptcies in the sector have served to lower overall investor confidence in the crypto world this year. Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital collapsed in June, a $10 billion setback for the overall industry. Crypto lenders Voyager Digital and Celsius also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing overall market conditions and exposure to other collapsed crypto firms in their filings. Crypto experts believe these filings mark the bottom for the crypto world which can only go up from here.

Ben Small, analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, toldForbes magazine in early August that a “sea of green is showing across digital assets” and this “show of optimism” reflects the view among investors that a more aggressive plan of action from the Federal Reserve was expected. As regulators push ahead with plans to promote crypto, investors are eyeing up buying opportunities in the sector once again, with the biggest currencies in the crypto world dominating the headlines.

Biggest Digital Currencies in the World

10. Dogecoin

Market Capitalization as of August 12: $9 billion

Dogecoin is a surprise inclusion in the biggest digital currencies in the world. The coin, which started out as a joke in 2013, has become one of the most popular in the world thanks to celebrity promotions. The real-world usage of the coin has increased in the meanwhile as well. The coin has inspired other joke coins as well, and the trades in these coins have become notorious in the crypto world. Billionaire Elon Musk is one of the biggest backers of the coin and regularly hypes it on social media.

Currencies like Dogecoin are becoming popular as companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the California-based technology giant, hype the crypto industry. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm TCI Fund Management is a leading shareholder in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), with 2.3 million shares worth more than $6.6 billion.

Just like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the stocks popular in the cryptoverse.

In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Wedgewood Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) grew its core search revenues +24% on a +30% year-ago comparison. Despite this stellar top-line performance, shares sold off as the market began to discount fears of a recession. However, the stock has outperformed relative to other holdings as core Google Search has been less affected by disruptions related to Apple’s privacy initiatives. Alphabet’s Cloud segment is generating revenue at a $24 billion run rate but is still running at a loss. We think this business can generate much better margins at some point. In the meantime, the Company has 4% to 5% of shares authorized for repurchase which is an attractive use of capital as the stock trades for about just 18X 2023 consensus estimates.”

9. Polkadot

Market Capitalization as of August 12: $9.5 billion

Polkadot is a cryptocurrency whose primary use is to act as a chain between different blockchain networks. As cryptocurrencies become more popular, the use of Polkadot has been increasing as well. Polkadot allows users to utilize the network to create new blockchains through the use of a function called the relay chain. These new blockchains operate independently of the Polkadot network but still use the inbuilt security. This allows the smaller blockchains to be protected against attacks. Polkadot can be traded through the services offered by CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), the Illinois-based derivatives exchange.

At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 58 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.9 billion in CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), compared to 55 the preceding quarter worth $2.7 billion.

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), for example, maintains a dominant franchise in electronic commodities and options trading with high incremental margins. Its interest rate trading business had been depressed coming out of the recession, but with a tightening policy environment, it now provides upside optionality that augments robust free cash flow growth and capital return. Willscot Mobile Mini is another compounder that executed well through the pandemic but was not initially recognized for the synergies of its Mobile Mini acquisition. The deal has reduced costs and created greater operating leverage as the company rides the tailwinds of improving industrial production and construction.”

8. Solana

Market Capitalization as of August 12: $13.7 billion

Solana is a cryptocurrency that operates on a network with one of the fastest transaction speeds in the crypto industry. The network can process 50,000 transactions per second, dwarfing the speeds of other prominent networks. Solana is in the process of making the network more friendly to decentralised finance and non-fungible tokens, two of the fastest growing sectors in the cryptoverse. The network also charges lower fees per transaction than peers, making it even more competitive as an alt-coin to Ethereum.

Solana is rising in prominence on social media through the crypto mainstreaming efforts of companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the EV maker from California. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 80 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $11 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 91 in the previous quarter worth $12 billion.

Here is what Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co. LLC has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“To put the demand growth for clean energy materials into perspective, let’s look at Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). At its Battery Day last year, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) projected three terawatt hours of lithium-ion battery capacity needed in 2030 for the EVs and storage they expect to produce. To reach this target, Tesla alone would gobble up approximately 75% of the world’s current nickel production and four times the world’s current lithium production. These numbers are astounding enough, but when one considers that EVs currently represent just 15% of global nickel demand and about 45% of lithium demand and that Tesla will likely be producing only a small proportion of the world’s EVs in 2030, the implications are staggering. Clean energy materials companies will make a lot more money in the decades to come than they ever have both because they will be selling a lot more metric tons of material and because there are certain to be shortages where supply can’t keep up with the rapidly growing demand.”

7. Cardano

Market Capitalization as of August 12: $17.1 billion

Cardano is one of the Ethereum spinoffs that has gained a cult following of its own in recent years. The reason that the coin has a cult following is that it was launched by a group of scientists and engineers that are experts in the field of blockchain technology. This group has more than 100 research papers on the subject published in various reputable journals around the world. Cardano has already transitioned to a more environment-friendly consensus mechanism, beating Ethereum in this endeavour.

The popularity of Cardano owes a lot to the crypto initiatives of firms like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), the New York-based payments processing firm. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Virginia-based investment firm Akre Capital Managementis a leading shareholder in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), with 5.8 million shares worth more than $2 billion.

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Saturna Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Given the likelihood of rising inflation and interest rates ahead, we anticipate adjustments to the portfolio to reduce exposure to highly valued stocks dependent on low interest rates to support terminal year valuations, while seeking investments in companies more correlated with a return to economic normalcy. We sold our position in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Although Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) does not charge or collect interest, its association with credit activities was problematic.”

6. Ripple

Market Capitalization as of August 12: $17.4 billion

Ripple is the coin used by RippleNet, a platform that has become popular as an alternative to the SWIFT payments system in the traditional banking world. The platform has gained in relevance as it charges lower fees and processes transactions quicker than the traditional banking system. The coin uses a consensus model called a Unique Node List, a little different from other coins that use proof-of-stake or proof-of-work mechanisms. The coin was created by RippleLabs in 2012.

Coins like Ripple are mined using the powerful machines manufactured by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the microchip maker from California. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 102 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $6.3 billion in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 110 the preceding quarter worth $10.4 billion.

In addition to Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks that crypto enthusiasts are buying.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, RiverPark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the leading designer of graphics processing chips (commonly known as GPU’s- graphics processing units), required for powerful computer processing. Over the past 20 years, the company has evolved through innovation and adaptation from a predominantly gaming- focused chip vendor to one of the largest semiconductor/software vendors in the world, dominating the core secular growth markets of gaming, data centers and professional visualization. Over the past decade, the company has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of over 20% while expanding operating margins and, through its asset light business model, producing ever increasing amounts of free cash flow. For 2021 the company generated 61% revenue growth to $27 billion, expanded its EBITDA margins to over 44% and generated over $8 billion of free cash flow. Over the past five years, the company has generated a cumulative $23 billion of FCF after cumulative capital expenditures of less than $4 billion.

We expect future growth to remain robust as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips and software are critical to many of the core technologies being adopted globally, including cloud computing, virtual reality and advanced artificial intelligence. As with NFLX, we took advantage of the over 40% recent drop in the company’s shares over the last several months to initiate a small position.”

When most people think about trading stocks, they imagine million-dollar brokers trading shares of major corporations like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, trading like a pro doesn’t necessarily require millions of dollars of free capital in your brokerage account. While multiple negative developments like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the COVID-19-related lockdowns in China, and the rising inflation in the US have frightened seasoned market veterans and aspiring investors alike, there are numerous opportunities if one seeks to find them.

Penny stocks, often referred to as “micro-cap” or “nano-cap” stocks are low-value stocks representing smaller companies. As the name suggests, these stocks are often priced under $5 per share — making them much more accessible to new investors or those with less capital. While they often represent high risk since there is a chance that they can stay at the bottom-end of the stock market, such stocks also offer exponential growth potential as they attract retail investors to the stock market, causing them to often dabble in cheap securities that can rally with time and sometimes grow up to huge multi-billion companies due to positive catalysts. These catalysts can include, but are not limited to, government contracts and subsidies, regulatory approvals for patents, and lucrative consumer product developments.

Some examples of old penny stocks that eventually surged to become extremely profitable market leaders include the retail giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the American automotive leader Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). 10 Best One Dollar Stocks To Buy Now

On June 14, B. Riley analyst Mayank Mamtani initiated coverage of Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE:LCTX) with a Buy rating and $4 price target. The analyst views Lineage as a ""deep value play"" in the cell therapy sector and believes the market undervalues its platform and pipeline due to the early stage of programs that are primarily focused on non-oncology indications. According to the analyst, investor perception will likely improve as they gain visibility into the later-stage development path for OpRegen, with its ""compelling"" Phase I/II geographic atrophy dataset that resulted in a ""transformative"" deal with Roche in December 2021.

Earlier this June, SVB Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz initiated coverage of Selecta Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:SELB) with an Outperform rating and $7 price target. The analyst views the company's immune tolerance platform ImmTOR's approach as ""de-risked"" by early clinical data from SEL-212 and believes that the ability to tame the immune response from a ""notoriously immunogenic foreign enzyme"" bodes well for its clinical potential in combination with gene therapies and autoimmune therapies.

370,California’s Newsom Escalates GOP Jabs to Build National Profile,"(Bloomberg) -- The fate of Democrats vying for congressional seats in November is uncertain. But Election Day almost certainly will result in a great night for one party member: California Governor Gavin Newsom.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The Fed’s Damage to the Housing Market May Last Years Striking Drop in Stress Hormone Predicts Long Covid in Study Trump Calls for Release of Warrant Documents Used in Search China Has Painted Itself Into a Semiconductor Corner Three Days After Vote, Result Hangs in the Balance: Kenya Update

The first-term Democrat, who easily beat back a recall attempt less than a year ago, is facing nominal opposition in his re-election bid from a rural Republican farmer in a liberal bastion that hasn’t elected a GOP candidate to statewide office since 2006. Released from the need to conduct a traditional campaign, he’s instead raising his national profile.

Through pointed tweets, news conferences and posts on Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, Newsom has taken to expressing the frustration of Democrats enraged by the rollback of progressive priorities. He’s trolled the conservative governors of Florida and Texas with ads in their states touting how California is a haven for reproductive rights and gun limits. In the past week alone, he’s blasted Indiana’s new abortion restrictions and released a video he called “Hypocrite or Fraud” about conservative leaders’ stance toward Covid-19 vaccine mandates.

Such attention-grabbing tactics have launched the leader of the most-populous state into the conversation about potential Democratic presidential nominees should Joe Biden not run again, even as Newsom says he has “sub-zero interest” in entering the 2024 race. They’ve also made him a target for Republican officials and a foil to GOP governors such as Texas’s Greg Abbott and Florida’s Ron DeSantis, who himself is building an outsized national presence.

They have a seemingly easy punching bag in California, home to the country’s most expensive residential markets, the largest percentage of those in poverty, and some of the highest gasoline prices. Its population has fallen for the first time in more than a century, with many movers decamping to Texas and Florida. Yet the Golden State’s economy -- the fifth-largest in the world -- is still strong, Newsom is enjoying a record budget surplus and, importantly, he has the support of a Democratic base at home, giving him room to talk on national issues.

Story continues

Unless Newsom makes a crippling mistake, the 54-year-old is “pretty secure” in his re-election, said Mindy Romero, director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy in Sacramento. For the governor and his advisers, she said, it’s about maximizing opportunity.

“The question is: How do we run this campaign to get the most advantage out of it for our party in the state and potentially our party nationally and for his own political future?” she said.

Nathan Click, spokesperson for the Newsom campaign, said the governor is fighting for Democrats and that the “contrast couldn’t be clearer” between California and Republican-led states on issues such as abortion, guns and climate change.

“For Governor Newsom, this is a moment where Democrats need to be taking the fight to the GOP and calling them out for taking away Americans freedoms -- and that’s exactly what he is doing,” Click said in an emailed statement.

While the former San Francisco mayor is widely seen as having presidential ambitions, he has taken pains to show allegiance to Biden, who allies say is readying plans to launch a re-election bid after a string of policy successes. Newsom, too, has longtime ties to Vice President Kamala Harris, a Bay Area native, raising potential complications should she plan to run.

He also has some catching up to do when it comes to national recognition, said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist and pollster in Miami, who said the Florida ad made a splash only with political junkies.

“Newsom is largely an undefined quantity to the vast majority of Democratic voters outside of California, which is precisely why I think you see him trying to build a national profile with everyday Democratic voters outside of California,” Amandi said.

Whatever happens, Newsom is well-positioned to capitalize on his stature and shape the national party, said Mike Madrid, former political director of the California Republican Party. The governor enjoys a broad advantage in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly two to one.

He also has plenty of money: As of Aug. 1, Newsom had about $24 million in campaign cash on hand from high-profile donors such as Steven Spielberg and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. His Republican challenger, state senator Brian Dahle, had just $307,000.

“Unless Democrats are somehow able to hold on, Gavin Newsom is going to be the biggest winner nationally on election night,” Madrid said. “He’s going to win re-election by 20 points, and no Democrat is going to do that.”

Newsom won his first term in 2018 as governor with about 62% of the vote. That’s the same percentage that rejected removing him from office in September’s recall election. The recall movement largely stemmed from blowback to his coronavirus restrictions, exacerbated by the governor flouting his own Covid rules by attending a swank Napa Valley dinner party.

But the recall backers also focused on issues such as crime and cost of living, social problems that have become economic ones for California. Over the past few years, prominent companies such as Tesla Inc., Oracle Corp., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Charles Schwab Corp. relocated their hubs to the cheaper and more tax-friendly Lone Star state. Even before the pandemic, California ranked high among states from which people moved, and the trend accelerated, an analysis of United Van Lines data by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago shows.

Texas and Florida ranked as the No. 1 and No. 3 destinations for California expats in 2020 and 2021 -- Washington was second -- and Newsom has been promoting his state as a better alternative. His ad in Florida urged residents to “join us in California, where we still believe in freedom.” He’s proposed incentives for companies to move from areas with restrictive policies on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, and supports extending $1.65 billion in tax credits to lure Hollywood studios to film at home instead of in anti-abortion states.

He has caught the attention of Republicans such as Abbott, who taunted Newsom at last week’s Conservative Political Action Conference and touted Texas’s business wins. For the GOP, the home of Hollywood and Silicon Valley is an “easy foil” and “a scapegoat” to demonstrate what’s wrong with Democrats, said Jessica Taylor, governors editor at the Cook Political Report.

It’s too speculative now to determine if Newsom, who emerged from the recall even stronger, would find his background a disadvantage if he vies for president, she said. “What Democrats have to do is not sort of alienate rural voters and blue collar workers, and a governor of California -- that might be a little hard,” she said.

For now Newsom has little to lose. His ratings in California -- about 52% approval among likely voters -- are “fairly stable,” said Dean Bonner, associate survey director for the Public Policy Institute of California. Meanwhile, independents, which comprise almost the same share of voters as Republicans, tend to lean toward Democrats, he said.

And even if he doesn’t intend to run for president in 2024, it makes sense for Newsom to raise his profile nationally, said some consultants and analysts.

“Until he eats a corn dog at the Iowa State Fair, or until he stands in someone’s living room in New Hampshire, he’s just having fun and tilting at the windmills of presidential politics while running for re-election,” said David McCuan, chair of the political science department at Sonoma State University.

371,10 EV Stocks that Will Benefit from Climate Change Bill 2022,"In this article, we will discuss 10 EV stocks that will benefit from the Climate Change Bill 2022. If you want to skip reading about the details of the bill, go directly to 5 EV Stocks that Will Benefit from Climate Change Bill 2022.

On August 7, the U.S. Senate approved a comprehensive $430 billion bill to combat climate change, decrease drug prices, and increase a few corporate taxes. The bill, also known as the Inflation Reduction Act, would provide electric car buyers tax credit. Presently, taxpayers were given a tax credit of $7,500 on buying an EV, and there was a limit of giving tax credits to 200,000 customers for each EV manufacturer. Under the new bill, this limit has been eliminated, and the tax credit has been extended till 2032. Furthermore, the government also announced a tax credit of $4,000 on used EVs, which are priced at $25,000 or less. To become eligible for the tax credit for a used vehicle, the gross annual income for a family should be $150,000 or lower.

The bill requires that the EV is manufactured in North America, and the critical raw materials and other components should be either sourced from the US or a nation that has a free-trade agreement with the US. This would mean that some EVs that are sold in the US but do not fulfill these requirements would be ineligible for the tax credit when the law comes into effect from January 2023. The new tax credit would be applicable on trucks, sports utility vehicles (SUVs), and vans under the price of $80,000 and cars up to $55,000. Furthermore, the tax credit on new EVs would only be granted to families that have a gross annual income of $300,000 or under. The US government also gave $3 billion to the US Postal Service to acquire EVs and equipment related to battery charging.

The US government is promoting EVs to combat climate and environmental deterioration. According to the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), conventionally powered fuel engines are responsible for contributing 27% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the US. In comparison, battery-powered cars only produce a fraction of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. However, EVs have not become as economical as fuel-powered vehicles because critical raw materials like lithium have observed a significant increase in prices due to high demand and limited supply. According to Irvine, California-based automobile research and valuation firm Kelly Blue Book, the average price of EVs has risen by 14% YoY to $66,000, which is $20,000 higher than the average price for all new cars. The demand for EVs is strong, and companies are either not taking fresh orders due to the significant backlog of orders or giving a delivery date from January 2023 to April 2023. Some of the most popular players in the EV industry include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN).

Our Methodology

Given the favorable outlook for the EV industry following the Climate Change Bill, we will go through the 10 EV stocks that will benefit from the bill. We will look into how these companies will capitalize on the developments discussed above. Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds was used to derive the hedge fund sentiment concerning each stock as of Q1 2022.

10 EV Stocks that Will Benefit from Climate Change Bill 2022

10. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 9

Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) is a Japanese automobile manufacturer. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) would benefit from the removal of the limit over granting tax credits as it had recently used up its quota of giving tax credits to 200,000 customers. However, Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) would need to modify the production of bZ4x and Mirai variants to make them eligible for the tax credit. Under the requirements of the bill, both these vehicles will not be eligible because they are not manufactured in North America.

Hence, Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) is preparing to boost its EV production in the US. The company reached a new supply agreement to procure 4,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate annually from the Rhyolite Ridge mining project owned and operated by Ioneer Limited. The lithium will be enough to produce around 150,000 EVs annually. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) anticipates achieving annual EV sales of 3.5 million by 2030. The company sold 1.6 million EVs globally in 2021.

Baron Funds shared its thoughts on Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Toyota’s (NYSE:TM) “kaizen” manufacturing philosophy is based on improving manufacturing by using “just in time” processes to eliminate waste and reduce inventory carrying costs. Clearly the company does not contemplates disruptive change that will dramatically lower costs and improve quality.”

9. Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16

Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) is a Manhattan Beach, California-based EV company.

Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) intends to use the “Transition Rule” of the Climate Change Bill and get reservations for the company’s all-electric SUV Fisker Ocean by entering into a binding contract with the customers. Instead of receiving the full amount upfront, Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) is converting $100 and $250 deposits into non-refundable orders in their systems. The Fisker Ocean is priced at $37,499, excluding tax credit. After incorporating the impact of the credit, the price of $30,000 becomes very attractive. The pricing sets Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) apart from its competitors.

However, it should be noted that Fisker Ocean would not be eligible for the complete incentives proposed by the bill because its manufacturing will start in November 2022 through a third-party Magna plant in Graz, Austria. The US does not have a free trade agreement with Austria.

Citadel Investment Group increased its stake in Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) by 45% during Q1 2022.

8. ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16

ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT) is a Campbell, California-based developer of EV charging stations across North America and Europe.

ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT) will benefit from the higher sales of EVs and a higher level of support from the government following the imposition of the bill. Charging companies have been finding it challenging to keep up with the demand for new charging stations as the adoption of EVs is growing rapidly.

ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT) has entered into a partnership with Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Volvo Cars to provide its charging facilities at Starbucks stores along the 1,350-mile Denver to Seattle route. Four charging stations have been installed at the first Starbucks location in Provo, Utah, and additional locations will be picked for the installation of charging stations moving forward. ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT) also received a boost earlier this year when the US government announced in February that it would give $5 billion to states to fund the construction of EV chargers.

Overall, 16 funds held a stake worth $34.7 million in ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT) as of Q1 2022.

7. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16

Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) is a Newark, California-based luxury EV startup that is backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF).

The company’s Lucid Air will be ineligible for the tax credit as the starting price of the EV car is $107,400, significantly higher than the price limit set to qualify for the credit. However, Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) has the benefit of having its production facility located in Case Grande, Arizona, which makes the company’s offerings eligible for the tax credit. Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) is expected to develop a variant that falls in the required price range.

Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) is already working on expanding the production capability at its Case Grande facility under Phase-3 to 400,000 units annually. This will be a big jump as the company only delivered 1,379 vehicles during the first half of 2022 and intends to achieve an output of 6,000 to 7,000 units by the end of 2022.

The number of hedge funds having a stake in Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) increased from 14 in Q4 2021 to 16 in the second quarter of 2022.

6. Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19

Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV) is a Torrance, California-based EV startup in the pre-revenue stage.

During the Q2 2022 results, Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV) revealed that it finished the second quarter of the year with over $1 billion in the company’s sales pipeline. This was primarily due to the 4,500 units order placed by Walmart, Inc. (NYSE:WMT), which can potentially rise to 14,500 units. Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV) has also reached an agreement with the US Army to provide its EV for analysis and demonstration. This could also lead to a possible bulk order in the near future.

Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV) is expanding its operations and intends to launch an Electric Pickup Truck in 2023 that is expected to be priced around $35,000 to $50,000. The truck can be pre-ordered through the company website for a refundable fee of $100. As Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV) expands its production, the company will become a beneficiary of the Climate Change Bill as most of its products will be within the price range required to be eligible for the tax credit.

At the end of Q1 2022, 19 funds reported owning a stake in Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV).

Besides Canoo Inc. (NASDAQ:GOEV), popular companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) are also expected to benefit from Climate Change Bill 2022.

374,Automakers scramble to decode new U.S. EV tax credits,"By David Shepardson and Joseph White

WASHINGTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - U.S. automakers and dealers are scrambling to figure out if they can still offer $7,500 tax credits to would-be buyers of electric vehicles (EVs), as Congress prepares for final votes today on a bill that includes a top-to-bottom overhaul of Washington's clean vehicle policies.

Under the $430 billion climate, health care and tax bill that the House of Representatives is set to vote on Friday, rules governing the current $7,500 EV tax credit aimed at persuading consumers to buy the vehicles would be replaced by incentives designed to bring more battery and EV manufacturing into the United States.

Manufacturers, dealers and consumers do not have answers to many basic questions about how the new rules will affect the way clean vehicles aimed at consumers - including fully electric and hybrid models - will be bought, sold and built, automakers, consultants and lobbyists said.

However, industry executives were more positive about proposed incentives of up to $40,000 per vehicle for larger commercial electric vehicles, such as Tesla Inc's Semi or electric commercial vans developed by several manufacturers.

The provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act are ""a powerful tail wind in the commercial space,"" said RJ Scaringe, chief executive of Rivian which has an agreement to deliver up to 100,000 large vans to shareholder Amazon.com Inc.

The legislation brings ""a significant change in value chain requirements, in a very short period of time, that affects an industry where supply chain development ... is measured in years,"" said John Loehr, a managing director with consulting firm AlixPartners.

NO LONGER ELIGIBLE

The most immediate effect of the Inflation Reduction Act would be a ban on tax credits for vehicles assembled outside North America. That would mean about 70% of the 72 current EV and plug-in hybrids on the U.S. market would no longer be eligible, said the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which warned the change ""will surprise and disappoint customers in the market for a new vehicle"" and ""jeopardize"" EV sales goals.

Story continues

However, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told Reuters in an interview this week: ""This is ... going to be a very important long-term transformational policy to accelerate the EV revolution and to make sure it is a 'Made in America' EV revolution.""

""Industry is capable of sometimes more than they will at first see,"" Buttigieg added.

The Biden administration must still write and finalize implementing regulations to handle some of the complex questions raised by the quick rewrite of the tax credit.

New restrictions on battery sourcing and critical minerals, along with price caps and income caps, take effect on Jan. 1, which will potentially make all current EVs ineligible for the full $7,500 credit.

A Congressional Budget Office forecast estimated as few as 11,000 EVs may qualify for the tax credit in 2023.

The domestic content requirements ratchet up over the next six years.

Volvo Car North America said just one of its models that currently qualify for EV tax credits will still qualify after the bill is signed. The only one in the short term that will qualify is the S60 Recharge, that is assembled in South Carolina, and even that may not qualify after Jan. 1.

Several automakers, including startups Rivian and Fisker, this week began urging would-be customers to get off the fence and commit to buying vehicles before the current rules are replaced.

BINDING CONTRACT

The bill does allow consumers to still get the credit if they buy before Biden signs the bill into law, but must have a ""written binding contract"" to purchase.

Rivian encouraged would-be buyers in a letter to make $100 of their deposits non-refundable in order to qualify for the credit. Rivian executives said Thursday customers are ordering R1 trucks and SUVs with average prices of $93,000 - well above the cut-offs in the proposal before the House.

""We cannot guarantee that the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) will approve tax credit eligibility as we interpret the terms of the Inflation Reduction Act,"" Rivian cautioned in its letter.

Mercedes-Benz said it is ""reviewing the proposal in anticipation of the new provisions becoming final in the coming week.""

European Union and South Korean government officials on Thursday said they were concerned the domestic content and manufacturing requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act could violate World Trade Organization rules.

U.S. electric vehicle market leader Tesla and General Motors Co already sell their EVs without a federal tax credit, because they hit the 200,000 vehicle cap under the current law.

Tesla and GM may not become eligible to offer tax credits under the new law until Jan. 1. And even then, it is not clear which models - if any - will get the full $7,500 by meeting requirements that 40% of battery minerals come only from North America, or countries with which the United States has free trade agreements.

The proposed subsidy limits would hit hardest on automakers and battery makers with corporate parents in China.

Starting in 2024, rules will take effect that make vehicles ineligible for any credit if they have content from an ""foreign entity of concern,"" a term that could include Chinese firms.

The US economy is in a bad place right now. The gross domestic product (GDP) fell 0.9% on an annualized pace during the quarter ending June, and had previously fallen 1.6% in the first quarter of 2022. Two consecutive quarters of GDP decline generally constitute the definition of a recession, and anxious investor sentiment amid rising interest rates have given many high-profile stocks significant beatings in recent months. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have slid 15.5%, 17.4% and 9.15% in the year to date, respectively.

Still, the American economy added 528,000 jobs in July, an encouraging sign of resilient growth amid persistent fears of a prolonged bearish market. The employment rate stood at 3.5%, beating the Dow Jones estimate of 3.6%. Experts feel this data may hamper the recession trades put in by many investment firms, and no matter what the outlook (bearish or bullish), there's plenty of opportunity for investors with a keen eye for choosing the right stocks.

378,UPDATE 1-Top U.S. auto safety regulator stepping down,"(Adds background, comments)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The top U.S. auto safety regulator is stepping down to return to the California Air Resources Board, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Friday.

Steven Cliff has overseen the agency's safety investigations into Tesla as well as efforts to shrink sharply higher traffic deaths and significantly boost vehicle fuel economy requirements.

He was named NHTSA's deputy administrator in February 2021 but had been running the agency on an acting basis. In October President Joe Biden nominated him to be administrator and he was confirmed in the role in May by the U.S. Senate.

Cliff is a former deputy executive officer at CARB and will become executive officer at CARB effective Sept. 12. He was the first Senate-confirmed NHTSA administrator since January 2017.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said NHTSA’s chief counsel, Ann Carlson, will assume Cliff's duties when he departs. Carlson was previously co-director of UCLA Law’s Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.

Cliff said in a statement he was honored to work with agency staff ""on a series of measures that will make vehicles more fuel efficient and safer for all Americans.""

NHTSA in March sharply boosted fuel efficiency requirements through 2026, reversing former President Donald Trump's rollback of U.S. regulations aimed at improving gas mileage and cutting tailpipe pollution. Under Cliff, NHTSA also reinstated a sharp increase in penalties for automakers whose vehicles do not meet fuel efficiency requirements.

In May, NHTSA said U.S. traffic deaths jumped 10.5% in 2021 to 42,915, marking the highest number killed on American roads in a single year since 2005 and the highest reported since the agency began using its current traffic fatality tracking system in 1975. Cliff said the figures confirm ""we have a deadly crisis on our nation's roads.""

Story continues

TESLA PROBE

In June, NHTSA upgraded its investigation into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with Autopilot involving crashes into parked emergency vehicles.

Cliff told Reuters in July he wanted to complete the defect investigation into Tesla's Autopilot ""as quickly as we possibly can but I also want to get it right. There's a lot of information that we need to comb through.""

Since 2016, NHTSA has opened 38 special investigations of crashes involving Tesla vehicles where advanced driver assistance systems were suspected of being used.

The agency has increased investigations into various safety issues involving Tesla and the automaker agreed to a rising number of recalls. (Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Mark Porter and Frances Kerry)",2022-08-12T17:30:51+00:00,2022-08-12
379,The 7 Best Lithium Stocks to Buy Now,"The lithium craze has reached new heights, with prices for the element skyrocketing more than 400% in the past couple of years. Electric vehicle (EV) sales are on an upswing, and investors have flocked to companies that produce them as their investment of choice. Lithium batteries are critical for the proliferation of EVs, which is why investors have gravitated toward the best lithium stocks to buy.

With the increasing demand for lithium-ion batteries as well as energy storage systems that save power from being lost during distribution, some estimates point to a doubling of this mineral in the next few years. The U.S., through its Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, set aside $5 billion in federal funding for EV charging stations. The goal is to get EVs to account for 50% of new auto sales by the conclusion of this decade.

Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium mining startup that is currently in the pre-revenue stage. It is developing a mine in Argentina with its partner Ganfeng (OTCMKTS:GNENF). However, the investor enthusiasm in the stock relates to its Nevada mine called the Thacker Pass project. LAC aims to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium by electric car producers and other sectors. If the Thacker Pass project is greenlit, it could produce nearly 60,000 tonnes of lithium.

Based on current prices of roughly $50,000 per tonne, the company could be looking at a whopping $3 billion in annual sales. LAC stock has recently enjoyed a terrific run at the stock market as investors bid up lithium assets. Though the market faces considerable headwinds, LAC remains an excellent speculative stock.

Livent Corp (NYSE:LTHM) is one of the top pure plays in the lithium industry. It’s a business that’s known for low-cost production of carbonate, particularly in Argentina.  Livent has produced lithium products at low costs remarkably well and effectively produces lithium carbonate and hydroxide. Its top-line and bottom-line results have been stellar over the past five years, with revenue and earnings averaging in at 8.9% and 35.9%, respectively.

Story continues

The company expects its lithium carbonate production capacity to rise from 20 kilo tonnes per annum (ktpa) to 100 ktpa by 2030. In achieving this goal, Livent is quickly expanding its footprint in Argentina. Moreover, results of late have been tremendous, with the company posting comfortable earning beats in the past several quarters.

Best Lithium Stocks: Piedmont Lithium (PLL) a lithium mine

North Carolina-based Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) is another pre-revenue lithium miner. It aims to “serve the important vehicle and stationary storage markets in the USA and Europe.” The lithium hydroxide is primarily sourced from China, and Piedmont hopes to change things around in this regard meaningfully.

Due to some nifty acquisitions last year, the company is showing signs of potentially becoming a lithium conglomerate. However, the market remains fixated on its regulatory challenges and has turned a blind eye to the miner’s massive long-term potential. Moreover, it has stakes in some of the top lithium projects, including Sayona Mining and Atlantic Lithium. If it can get its lithium mining and processing plants in North Carolina up and running, it is likely to become a massive player.

Albemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen

Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a specialty chemical giant that operates three main segments: bromine, lithium and catalysts. The lithium business accounts for roughly 42% of total sales, and the enterprise owns facilities across Nevada, China, Taiwan and Germany, which makes it a global firm.

It sells lithium through fixed and variable contracts but has recently decided to go all in on variable-priced contracts. The move will likely benefit the company immensely, as lithium prices will likely remain robust for the foreseeable future. Albemarle will be increasing its production capacity in the next three to five years to meet the growing demand. Consequently, its capacity could rise by 127.3% by 2025. Its strong position in the space has enabled it to become remarkably profitable over the past decade, rewarding its shareholders with increasing dividends for the past 27 years.

Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is a Chilean low-cost lithium producer with strong exposure to the profitable fertilizer market as well. Nevertheless, the lithium and derivatives segment accounts for 40% of sales, confirming its strong focus on its lithium division. The enterprise focuses purely on lithium carbonate but is expanding into lithium hydroxide through its investments in Australia.

Moreover, the business is already profitable — a rarity in the segment. That has plenty to do with the diversity of its income streams. Lithium sales during the first quarter rose 59%, and prices have spiked by close to seven times due to the push toward electrification. These trends will likely strengthen over time, benefiting the business immensely.

Standard Lithium (NYSEMKT:SLI) is an innovative lithium development company that could potentially blow up in the coming years. Its flagship project is located in Southern Arkansas and is called Lanxess, which could deliver 20,900 tons of lithium carbonate. It’s still early days in the plant’s development, but it could become a major lithium source down the road.

The Lanxess brine project is arguably the most advanced in the U.S. Preliminary assessments point to a project life of nearly 25 years. The average annualized sales to be generated from the project are close to $283 million. Additionally, the competitive advantages of the plant are unparalleled, marked by a robust infrastructure. SLI is still in its early stages of becoming a major player, but its long-term growth outlook is staggering.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is far from being a pure play in the sector, but being the biggest EV producer, it’s easy to understand why it’s on the list. It’s one of the few companies that is actually delivering EVs to customers in massive numbers. Naturally, the growing demand for its vehicles will continue to increase the demand for lithium batteries.

However, with rising metal prices, the supply-demand imbalance has become a major talking point in the sector. The company’s eccentric CEO Elon Musk tweeted a few months ago how Tesla would have to go into the lithium mining and refining business soon. With an incredible track record in the EV space, I wouldn’t be surprised if it can successfully execute its plans down the road. That would surely end up limiting its cost burden.

380,Jeep Maker May Invest Billions to Make EVs in Mexico,"(Bloomberg) -- Stellantis NV is considering renovating a plant in Mexico to build hybrid and electric vehicles as it transforms its lineup to meet surging demand for battery-powered transport.

The owner of the Jeep, Peugeot and Ram brands is contemplating a retooling of its factory in Saltillo, Coahuila, one of northern Mexico’s industrial hubs about 200 miles from the Texas border, according to people familiar with the deliberations, who asked not to be named without permission to speak publicly.

The company is also evaluating the possibility of instead investing in Mexico state, where it also has a plant in the city of Toluca, or in Sonora state, although Saltillo is the front-runner in terms of potential sites, one of the people said. The investment would be in the multibillion-dollar range and would occur over the coming years, the person said.

The plans haven’t been finalized and could still change, the people said.

“We invest regularly in plants all around the world to upgrade in terms of process, vehicle production or adapt to electrification as part of our $35 billion investment in electrification and software announced during our EV Day one year ago,” Shawn Morgan, a company spokeswoman, said in an emailed response to questions.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Finance Minister Rogelio Ramirez de la O and Economy Minister Tatiana Clouthier met with Stellantis executives including Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares on July 20 to discuss electric vehicles and the desire to strengthen the company’s supply chain in Mexico, Clouthier said at the time.

One concern for the company has been ensuring that it has adequate electricity supply for its plant, according to two of the people familiar with its plans.

Story continues

The issue of energy and Lopez Obrador’s moves to prioritize the state electricity provider at the expense of private and foreign companies have sparked outcry from firms. The governments of the US and Canada last month requested formal talks with the Mexican government, alleging that its current policies violate a 2020 free-trade agreement between the three nations.

In a tweet after last month’s meeting with Stellantis, Ramirez de la O, the finance minister, said that the company’s investments in Mexico will create jobs, and that the nation can help firms ensure sufficient energy supply and a realistic and effective transition to clean energy.

Stellantis already makes the compact Jeep Compass crossover at its Toluca assembly plant. The automaker plans to bring electrified versions of the Compass to that plant in 2024, according to Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania.

Stellantis’s plants in Saltillo produce its Ram 1500 and heavy-duty pickup trucks, and the Ram ProMaster Van, which Tavares has flagged as a key product to tap demand for electric vans from e-commerce companies such as Amazon.com Inc.

The automaker’s strategic plan calls for it to make 75 fully electric models by the end of the decade and convert 50% of US sales and 75% of European sales to battery-powered vehicles.

Clouthier, the economy minister, said in a May interview that a big US automaker was eyeing an investment in northern Mexico and that an announcement would come shortly. Stellantis was formed last year from the megamerger between Fiat Chrysler -- one of the original US big three automakers -- and PSA Group.

Mexico has long been a hub for auto production directed at foreign buyers, and a slate of major auto companies and parts providers have announced new investments. General Motors Co. is making its Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox in Mexico, as Ford Motor Co. ramps up production of its Mustang Mach-E.

China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s biggest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, is considering at least two locations in northern Mexico, including Saltillo, for a plant to supply Tesla Inc. and Ford, Bloomberg News reported last month.

The governments of Mexican states have been providing incentives to attract investment, with Tesla even getting its own border lane to Texas to allow its suppliers in the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon to reduce wait times.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was authorized by the U.S Senate on August 7, with the deciding vote being cast by Vice President Kamala Harris. The $740 billion stimulus package is expected to affect corporate taxes, where a corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) of 15% will be liable, in addition to taxed share buybacks. The aim of the bill is to reduce overall inflation in the United States and move towards a greener environment.

The Inflation Reduction Act and Green Energy

The Inflation Reduction Act will allot billions towards green energy initiatives. That includes a 30% tax credit for building or repairing renewable energy plants, tax credits on green energy generation, and production-related credits for manufacturers of solar and wind power equipment and accessories. According to Peter Krull, the director of investments at the North California-based Earth Equity Advisors, while 2020 was great for the alternative energy sector, 2021 and 2022 have been tough for the industry. Krull believes the Act will benefit green energy firms and propel them back into positive territory.

The Inflation Reduction Act and EV Manufacturers

The Inflation Reduction Act will allocate a $7,500 consumer income tax credit for the purchase of a new electric vehicle, as well as a $4,000 tax credit for the purchase of a used EV, in its bid for a cleaner environment. However, there are price and income caps in place. For new electric vehicles, the retail price for cars can't exceed $55,000 in order for it to qualify for the tax credit. For SUVs, trucks, and vans, that price cap will be $80,000. The consumers eligible for these tax credits will also need to fall within a specified adjusted gross income range of $150,000, $300,000, and $225,000 in the case of single individuals, married couples, and individuals who file as the head of households, respectively.

Story continues

For electric vehicle manufacturers, the final assembly of the vehicles needs to take place in North America, and key materials for batteries must be manufactured or assembled in North America. The bill is intended to make the American EV industry more competitive and reduce its reliance on China.

The Inflation Reduction Act and Healthcare Provisions

The Inflation Reduction Act will work to lower health insurance costs for about 13 million Americans, capping medicine costs for seniors at $2,000 annually. Diabetes patients with Medicare will only have to pay $35 monthly for insulin. The government will start negotiating the price of ten drugs by 2026, which will expand up to 20 drugs by 2029. Seniors who are prescribed expensive medicines for cancer, multiple sclerosis, or other similar illnesses are the ones most likely to benefit from the bill. While big pharma is likely to be a loser in the wake of the Inflation Reduction Act, health insurers stand to gain tremendously.

Some of the top winners of The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH).  The Inflation Reduction Act 2022: Top 10 Winners

Sunnova is a residential solar and energy storage company that enables adoption through a network of installers with options for financing, service and broader home energy management.

(NASDAQ:RIVN) reassured shareholders about its FY production target of 25,000 units as its reservation book climbed to 98,000 from 90,000 previously. Thus, the analyst reaffirmed his 'Overweight' rating and $60 price target on the stock.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 29 hedge funds were bullish on Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) at the end of March 2022, compared to 47 funds in the earlier quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the leading shareholder in the company, with 30.8 million shares worth over $1.5 billion.

Here is what Baron Global Advantage Fund had to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“Rivian Automotive, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells consumer and commercial electric vehicles. Shares of Rivian continued its volatile trading following the stock’s IPO in late 2021, declining 52% in the first quarter as investors rotated out of fast-growing long-duration stocks and as industry wide supply-chain issues delayed Rivian’s production ramp. In addition, even while other automotive companies raised prices due to inflationary pressures, Rivian launched a price increase campaign that was not well communicated and, as a result, was met with dissatisfaction by existing reservation holders. While this was an unforced error, the company quickly corrected course, reversing its decision to raise prices for existing reservations, while maintaining the increase on new buyers (which has not caused a material impact to demand). We retain conviction in the shares given management’s vision, Rivian’s product positioning, the company’s relationship with Amazon.com, and the company’s strong balance sheet, which will help it overcome the current challenges while taking advantage of the long-term opportunity as the market transitions to electric vehicles.”

8. Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31

Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) is a Texas-based company that provides energy-related services, such as infrastructure, natural gas storage facilities, and natural gas transportation pipelines. Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stands to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act as the legislation aims to eliminate the uncertainty around new infrastructure projects. Gas is considered a cleaner source of energy than coal, and in the shift towards renewables, natural gas will be preferred until there is mainstream adoption of renewable energy. This transition could take years, during which time gas companies like Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) will make money and the government will continue to subsidize new pipelines and energy infrastructure.

On August 3, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) reported its Q2 results, announcing GAAP earnings per share of $0.39, topping the market consensus by $0.02. The company's revenue came in at approximately $26 billion, up 71.5% year-over-year, and outperforming Wall Street's estimates by $5.57 billion. Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) also declared a $0.23 per share quarterly dividend on July 26, a 15% increase from its prior dividend of $0.20. The dividend is distributable on August 19, to shareholders of record as of August 8. ET shares delivered a dividend yield of 7.93% as of August 12. The company aims to return extra value to stakeholders while maintaining its leverage ratio of 4.0x-4.5x debt-to-EBITDA.

On July 20, Barclays analyst Theresa Chen maintained an 'Overweight' rating on Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) and lowered the price target on the shares to $13 from $14. The analyst appreciates firms with ""solid"" Q2 midstream earnings and expects the group to ""generally fare better than other energy subsectors amid a trading environment rife with volatility"".

Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) was part of 31 public stock portfolios at the end of Q1 2022, compared to 36 funds in the prior quarter. David Abrams’ Abrams Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with over 22 million shares worth $247.5 million.

Miller Value Partners, an investment firm, talked about Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET) in its Q2 2021 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:

“Energy Transfer LP (ET) rose over the period along with the price of oil climbing 40.59% over the period. The company received positive news that the Dakota Access Pipeline project would not be shut down while the Environmental Impact Statement by the US Army Corps of Engineers is drawn up. Energy Transfer reported strong 1Q results with revenue of $17B surpassing expectations for $11.8B with adjusted earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) hitting $5.04B ahead of consensus of $2.77B. The company raised full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $12.9-13.3B from $10.6-11.0B previously, with the increase largely related to the benefits realized from Winter Storm Uri. The company paid down $3.7B in debt during the quarter, using strong cash flow to reduce leverage. The company also announced the issuance of $900M in 6.5% Series H perpetual preferreds with the company using the proceeds to repay debt and for general purposes.”

7. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35

First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) is an Arizona-based company that provides photovoltaic solar energy solutions in the United States, Japan, France, Canada, India, Australia, and other international markets. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the leading American renewable energy firms, and it stands to be one of the biggest winners of the Inflation Reduction Act. The stock rose 9% on August 8 as the climate bill made headlines.

On August 11, KeyBanc analyst Sophie Karp upgraded First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) to 'Overweight' from 'Sector Weight' with a $145 price target. The manufacturing tax credit for locally made solar panels makes First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) the most direct beneficiary of the Inflation Reduction Act in her coverage, the analyst contended. Despite comparative outperformance since the IRA became public, the analyst sees additional upside, particularly due to First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)’s success towards scaling larger operations and reducing input costs. The analyst estimates that First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) could be eligible for about $400 million in tax credits, and should achieve at least a 20% gross margin by 2025 on over $3 billion in revenue.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were long First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) at the end of Q1 2022, compared to 36 funds in the prior quarter. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is one of the leading shareholders of the company, with 931,000 shares worth $78 million.

Here is what White Brook Capital had to say about First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) in its Q1 2021 investor letter:

“First Solar (FSLR) and Itron (ITRI), both of which I’ve written about in past In Focus sections, were long-term positions that were sold as their prices exceeded price targets. Both are solid companies that remain on my watchlist, but the opportunity cost of not investing in other potential investments exceeded their potential mid-term returns.”

6. Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37

Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company specializes in residential solar energy systems in the United States.

(NASDAQ:RUN) continues to forecast solar energy installed growth of 25% or more for 2022, after 246.5 MW were installed during the second quarter.

On August 8, JPMorgan analyst Mark Strouse raised the price target on Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) to $65 from $52 and kept an 'Overweight' rating on the shares. The analyst sees the Inflation Reduction Act as the largest policy in U.S. history to boost growth in a transformational shift to renewable energy. Although alternative energy stocks have gained since the bill first made headlines, there is further upside for most companies in the space, said the analyst.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 37 hedge funds were bullish on Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) at the end of the first quarter of 2022, up from 31 funds in the earlier quarter. William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management is the largest shareholder of the company, with 10.71 million shares worth $325.3 million.

Like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), smart investors are monitoring Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN), as it stands to be one of the top winners in the wake of the Senate bill.

Here is what Horizon Kinetics had to say about Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:

“What this table did not cover is valuation. What’s expensive, what’s cheap? A good business that is too expensive is not a good investment. The most expensive business on the table is Sunrun. Sunrun is the nation’s largest residential rooftop solar panel system seller/installer. Sunrun’s valuation might also shed Thumbnail valuation.

To start at the top of the income statement, Sunrun shares trade at 10.3x revenues. The most profitable company in the S&P 500, Microsoft, trades at 13x revenues. Sunrun operates at a loss. Obviously, not only is tremendous growth anticipated, but tremendous profitability, too.

Let’s simply accept that investors have correctly anticipated Sunrun’s future success and make that the starting point for a valuation exercise.

If, 10 years from now, Sunrun is ultimately valued at 25x net income, and if today’s $9.5 billion valuation is appropriate, that would require $380 million of net income ($9,500 million ÷ 25).

Let’s say Sunrun will have the same net profit margin as the average S&P 500 company, which is 10%. That means it would need $3,800 million of sales to generate that level of earnings ($380 mill ÷ 10%).

Since sales are now $920 million, they would have to rise by 4.1x in the next 10 years. That would require annual sales growth of 15.2%.

You see how neatly that all works: investors accept the company’s 10-year, 15% annual sales growth projections, and if a 10% net profit margin and a P/E of 25x earnings are reasonable, then the company will have a $9.5 billion market cap at that time. Except that is the current price. That means a 10-year return of zero.

In order to get a 10% annualized return from the stock, Sunrun would need to be priced at a P/E of 65x its earnings 10 years from now, if at a 10% net margin. Or it would have to have some combination of lower P/E and higher growth and/or higher profit margin.

In the meantime, this is Sunrun’s recent pattern of revenue growth and profitability (the company did recently increase its estimate of installed-capacity growth in 2021 from 20-25% to a new estimate of 25% to 30%).

For the time being, Sunrun loses an extraordinary amount of money, an amount that has been getting larger. Perhaps there are economies of scale that will manifest in the future,so that it will attain profitability. Perhaps from the roughly one-half of Sunrun’s revenues that are from long-term customer service agreements that run up to 25 years. For now, though, the company would seem to require a lot of external financing, and that is one of the greatest business risks.”

Here is what Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co. LLC had to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“To put the demand growth for clean energy materials into perspective, let’s look at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). At its Battery Day last year, Tesla projected three terawatt hours of lithium-ion battery capacity needed in 2030 for the EVs and storage they expect to produce. To reach this target, Tesla alone would gobble up approximately 75% of the world’s current nickel production and four times the world’s current lithium production. These numbers are astounding enough, but when one considers that EVs currently represent just 15% of global nickel demand and about 45% of lithium demand and that Tesla will likely be producing only a small proportion of the world’s EVs in 2030, the implications are staggering. Clean energy materials companies will make a lot more money in the decades to come than they ever have both because they will be selling a lot more metric tons of material and because there are certain to be shortages where supply can’t keep up with the rapidly growing demand.”

395,The 3 Best Tech ETFs to Buy Now,"One of the best ways to make a great deal of money in the stock market is by buying shares of companies that are benefiting from tech revolutions. The best tech ETFs are often great choices for retail investors because they give everyone the ability to exploit revolutions without taking on a ton of risk.

Two of the biggest changes in our society, of course, are the widespread adoption of solar energy and electric vehicles. Luckily, two ETFs enable investors to benefit directly from the explosion of those two technologies.

If you want to dive in before these trends explode, here are three of the best tech ETFs to buy now:

Best Tech ETFs: Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background.

Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.com

Expense Ratio: 0.66%, or $66 on an initial $10,000 investment

Three recent developments have lit a fire under solar stocks in general and the Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) in particular.

The Senate and House of Representatives recently passed the Democrats’ budget bill, which, if signed into law, would implement a 30% investment tax credit for all solar energy projects for 10 years. Solar energy companies are poised to get a tremendous boost in the U.S. for many years to come.

Meanwhile, in June, President Joe Biden waived tariffs on solar imports from several Southeastern Asian countries for two years. The move will tremendously benefit the many Chinese solar companies that have factories in those nations and the firms that carry out solar projects in the U.S.

Finally, the European Union in May decided to attempt to install a huge “400GW of solar PV by 2025 and almost 740GW by 2030.”

The electrification of transportation, along with the pro-solar policies of China, India and many other nations, should also tremendously boost the TAN ETF, making it one of the best tech ETS to buy.

Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) a line of AA batteries to represent battery stocks

Expense Ratio: 0.75%

Story continues

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk recently wrote that “lithium batteries are the new oil.” In other words, with EV demand and production exploding, countries and automakers are striving mightily to get their hands on as much lithium and as many electric vehicle batteries as they can.

Providing another great endorsement for Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT), Musk also recently called mining and refining lithium “a license to print money.”

That situation, of course, sounds great for lithium miners and battery makers. And in the last few weeks, both types of companies have reported very strong quarterly results.

LG Chem, which trades in South Korea, on July 29 reported that its profit had soared 400% year over year, driven partly by an improvement in its EV battery business.

“We are seeing gradual increases in our cylindrical battery shipments and we expect to see continuous growth as the global EV demand continues to grow,” the company’s CFO said.

Meanwhile, on Aug. 2, lithium miner Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) reported higher-than-expected Q2 EPS and raised its full-year EPS guidance as its revenue from lithium increased 178% YOY.

ALB stock is the biggest component of the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF, accounting for 12% of its overall holdings.

Best Tech ETFs: Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO) An image of a robot hand pointing toward a data graph

Source: Have a nice day Photo/Shutterstock

Expense Ratio: 0.95%

Robo Global (NYSEARCA:ROBO) is a very good, low-risk means of benefiting from the robotics and automation trend. Its top holdings include Fanuc (OTCMKTS:FANUY), a leader in industrial robotics, and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), a leader in workflow automation.

Another one of the fund’s holdings is Azenta (NASDAQ:AZTA), an intriguing company that “provides life science sample exploration and management solutions for the life sciences market.” Among its leading products are “automated cold sample management systems.” By automating processes in the life sciences sector that usually require highly compensated human employees, Azenta can save firms in the space tremendous amounts of money.

In the month that ended on Aug. 11, ROBO stock climbed 16%, indicating that the ETF is starting to heat up.

On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in LIT. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.

The billionaire laid out a familiar vision for using technology to ensure humanity’s future for the July edition of the CAC’s official magazine, joining local industry luminaries including Ant Group Co. Chairman Eric Jing, who offered his thoughts on responsible tech development that promotes inclusiveness.

Those echo the broader goals of President Xi Jinping’s administration, which for more than a year has worked to curtail the power of tech leaders like Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. That crackdown, which wiped out more than $1 trillion of market value, began when regulators halted Ant’s record IPO in 2020 and peaked around the time Didi Global Inc. delisted -- an effort the CAC drove.

Musk’s efforts recalled the outreach by Meta Platforms Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet Inc.’s Sundar Pichai in years past, when US internet companies harbored aspirations of working with the world’s No. 2 economy.

“Musk is trying to walk the same tightrope that Zuckerberg and Pichai walked before him - but these are different times,” said Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Trivium China. “Tech execs trying to maintain healthy relationships in China are increasingly seeing that decision being taken out of their hands by either Chinese regulations, US users, or the US government. If Musk isn’t sitting in front of a congressional committee within a year being grilled on his relationship with China, I’ll be flabbergasted.”

China is the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles and home to Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, a centerpiece of the EV maker’s growth plans. The biggest supplier of EV batteries, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., is based in Fujian province. But Chinese consumers have in the past attacked Tesla for allegedly unfair practices, while others have protested the extent of its domestic data collection.

Musk, who has drawn criticism for his close ties to Beijing, last year joined Xi’s World Internet Conference to extol the virtues of international cooperation. A representative for Tesla China confirmed Musk had written the article but declined further comment.

“I want to do everything we can to maximize the use of technology to help achieve a better future for humanity,” Musk wrote. “To that end, any area that contributes to a sustainable future is worthy of our investment.”

Musk said in the column that the magazine, whose inaugural edition was published this year, had reached out to him for the article. The entrepreneur touched on his businesses, including Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which he calls the first step toward settling a city on Mars. He also talked up the Neuralink Corp. brain-machine interface and the humanoid Tesla Bot announced last year, which is set for its first prototype this year. He addresses his audience as his “Chinese friends” while putting the focus on larger themes of transport electrification.

“My greatest hope is that humans create a self-sustaining city on Mars,” Musk said, a familiar refrain. “Tesla Bots are initially positioned to replace people in repetitive, boring, and dangerous tasks. But the vision is for them to serve millions of households, such as cooking, mowing lawns, and caring for the elderly.”

400,Ola Founder Plans to Produce Made-in-India Electric Car By 2024,"(Bloomberg) -- Bhavish Aggarwal, who founded India’s top ride-hailing startup and then moved into manufacturing electric scooters, is expanding his business empire again, unveiling plans Monday to enter the electric-car market in competition with local giants like Tata Group and global automakers from Hyundai Motor Co. to Tesla Inc.

The 36-year-old entrepreneur said that Ola aims to launch its first electric car in the summer of 2024 with a 500-kilometer range. It plans to make its own lithium ion batteries, bringing down costs with local production. The goal is to forge a path toward self-reliance in the relevant technologies and then produce a made-in-India electric vehicle.

The futuristic-looking vehicle, with an all-glass roof, will be part of Aggarwal’s Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. His earlier startup, ANI Technologies Pvt., runs the Ola ride-hailing operations.

Aggarwal, whose backers include SoftBank Group Corp. and Tiger Global Management, announced the vehicle on a day India celebrated completing 75 years of independence from the British rule, and exactly a year after Ola’s electric two-wheel scooter was introduced.

In a sign of how crowded the market has become, Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd., part of a storied Indian conglomerate, plans to unveil a series of its own EVs the same day, according to local media.

Aggarwal has been tweeting teaser videos of a red car with only its rear wheels visible, as well as cheeky Bollywood movie one-liners, ahead of the Monday announcement.

Ola is pressing ahead with plans to earn what Aggarwal has called “a seat at the global EV table.” Last year, he unveiled what was billed the world’s largest electric-scooter plant at a site about three hours from its headquarters in Bangalore. The goal was to pump out about two million scooters annually, but plans have been marred by delivery delays, quality issues and, in some cases, scooters catching fire.

Story continues

Traditional combustion-engine scooters and motorcycles remain the favored mode of personal transport in India and dominate the country’s roads. But in recent years, the government has been pushing measures to improve urban air and reduce dependence on oil imports by boosting EV sales through reduced taxes and duty exemptions. Some 0.32 million such vehicles were sold in 2021, up 168% year-on-year, according to the government’s India Brand Equity Foundation.

India is projected to become the world’s third-largest auto market by 2030, the foundation said, and the government has set ambitious electrification goals for the period.

401,Why Rivian is still no Ford or Tesla: Morning Brief,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe

Monday, August 15, 2022

Today's newsletter is by Brian Sozzi, an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

I didn’t truly understand my lack of enthusiasm for the Rivian (RIVN) story until I pulled the t-tops off my ‘91 Trans AM this past weekend for another mid-life crisis cruise to the beach.

“How did this car capture my heart?” I wondered to myself. After a few moments, I traced the love affair back to seeing Pontiac commercials on TV as a kid hawking their famous tagline: ""We are driving excitement.""

Then, I was reminded how the auto industry has been built over decades by brash and bold executives such as Henry Ford, John DeLorean, Lee Iacocca, Elon Musk, and new entrant, Ford CEO Jim Farley.

I mean there was Farley, last week at a company town hall, essentially flipping the bird to Elon Musk at the end of a speech. That gets you excited about buying a Ford electric vehicle, even if you love a gas guzzling Shelby Mustang.

Of course, Farley is trying to match Musk's bravado, which has allowed Tesla to capture of minds of consumers, and, most importantly, investors over the last decade-plus. Investors have bought into Musk’s vision for Tesla, powering losses and fueling capital raises, and the results have been plain to see for shareholders. Farley is trying to make the same thing happen at Ford, spending billions to pivot the iconic automaker to an EV future.

All of which got me thinking about Rivian’s valuation, god awful post IPO stock performance, and future as I hit the road for a gas-fueled cruise in my 30-year-old sports car.

By almost all accounts — such as this MIT profile — Rivian founder RJ Scaringe is a low key guy. Rivian has declined to make Scaringe available to Yahoo Finance for an interview several times.

Story continues CEO RJ Scaringe stands outside the startup Rivian Automotive's electric vehicle factory in Normal, Illinois, U.S. April 11, 2022. Picture taken April 11, 2022. REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski

Scaringe has poured all of his professional life into making Rivian a reality. In a 2019 New York Times profile, Scaringe said he was spending only 5% of his time with his family. I appreciate the heart and hustle — I didn't start a car company, I just drive 'em.

The company’s two products – the electric trucks the R1T and R1S – look nifty. Who wouldn’t want to whip out a “camp kitchen” from inside their vehicle, as our sister publication TechCrunch reviewed.

Some of those on Wall Street who have met RJ are quick to note he's no Musk or Iacocca.

“Rivian has a unique culture and is building a special vehicle and EV vision for the future in my opinion,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives – who has met Scaringe – tells me. ""RJ is a technologist and is not promotional which is a positive in my opinion especially in this market.""

Fair enough.

The problem is, the general public has no idea who the hell he is. And by extension, they don't know Rivian, either. The public knows Elon Musk. They are getting to know Jim Farley. My mom remembers Lee Iacocca from his Chrysler minivan commercials.

Here’s what the general public does know about Rivian:

The company has lost more than $2 billion on an operating basis year to date. The company has fallen short on its production targets pitched during its IPO. Despite more than $15 billion in cash, the Street isn’t truly sold another capital raise won’t be needed sometime in 2023 as Rivian ramps production. The stock price is currently at $38. The IPO priced at $78 on November 10, 2021. The stock closed at $170.21 on November 16, 2021. Amazon has 100,000 orders for Rivian vans and is a large investor in the company. Who knows when all of those vans will be delivered – the company thinks it can make 25,000 vehicles this year (there are skeptics on this number being hit).

If Rivian is ever going to reach its full potential as an auto company and investment, Scaringe needs to channel the ghosts of legendary auto salesman that have come before him.

No one says he has to be buffoonish like Musk, tweeting constantly, buying Twitter, trying to not buy Twitter, and so on. Scaringe may not even need to be Farley, out there pumping up an entire nation of F-150 owners to swap out 10 year old rides for the new electric version. But Scaringe should find his voice soon.

402,T-Mobile Surprises as Tech Winner in Tough Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) -- With everything from once-high-flying software companies to behemoths such as Alphabet Inc. mired in losses this year, investors looking to make money in technology-related stocks have found a surprising winner -- T-Mobile US Inc.

The mobile-phone carrier has jumped 26% and is flirting with an all-time high. It’s the only tech, media or telecommunications stock among the Nasdaq 100 Index’s best performers, other than Activision Blizzard Inc., the video-game company that’s being acquired.

Fast-growing tech companies with high valuations have been hit by higher interest rates, while a slowing economy has weighed on advertising-dependent internet businesses. But T-Mobile has been surpassing estimates for new subscribers this year, helped by its cut-rate mobile phone plans.

“As we saw during the pandemic, cellular connectivity is essential in modern society and is one of the last things to be cut by consumers,” said Keith Snyder, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “They may drop to lower priced plans and hold off on purchasing new devices, but they won’t cancel service.” He has a strong buy rating on the stock.

T-Mobile has outperformed rivals AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. by aggressively pricing phone plans at lower tariffs, attracting customers whose wallets are being squeezed by rising inflation. AT&T fell 1.6% this year, while Verizon has slumped 13%.

It also made inroads into building out its 5G network since acquiring Sprint Corp. in 2020, at a time when its rivals were busy shedding their media ventures to turn their focus back to the telecom business.

T-Mobile is “benefitting from the Sprint merger, both on the revenue and cost side,” said Ric Prentiss, analyst at Raymond James, who has a strong buy recommendation on the stock. “T-Mobile has gained a 5G network advantage, and is no longer just a value leader but can compete and win on network quality as well.”

Story continues

To be sure, the stock isn’t cheap. Trading at 30 times forward earnings, it dwarfs AT&T at 7.3 and Verizon at 8.6 times. The rivals also pay dividends, unlike T-Mobile. That has kept investors looking for a steady stream dividends out of the fray.

Though T-Mobile has seen “great” business growth this year, it’s still “extremely expensive,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, a wealth management firm with $3.7 billion in assets that owns a Verizon stake. Bahnsen said the stock is a “speculative play more than it’s a stable value play.”

Tech Chart of the Day

The Nasdaq 100 recorded its fourth consecutive week of gains, its longest streak since November last year. The tech-heavy index has added about $3 trillion in market value since its June low. Technology stocks have rebounded in the past few weeks after a series of resilient quarter-end reports. They were further boosted by a softer-than-expected inflation data last week.

Top Tech Stories

Apple Inc. is set to expand ads to new areas of your iPhone and iPad in search of its next big revenue driver. China’s internet giants from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to ByteDance Ltd. have shared details of their prized algorithms with Beijing for the first time, an unprecedented move aimed at curbing data abuse that may end up compromising closely guarded corporate secrets. Dog-themed cryptocurrencies jumped on Monday amid broader retail-investor enthusiasm in the market, particularly as Ethereum works toward its much-anticipated software upgrade. Tesla Inc. chief Elon Musk has contributed a column for the official publication of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the powerful agency that oversees data security for companies from Alibaba to Tencent and works with other government organs to censor online content.

404,Elon Musk writes for China’s censors and welcomes more ‘like-minded Chinese partners’,"elon musk tesla

Elon Musk has told China’s tech industry censors that he would ""welcome more like-minded Chinese partners” in an article written for an official journal.

The billionaire also said Chinese companies “will be a force to be reckoned with in the cause of energy innovation” in his article, published in the monthly magazine of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).

The government agency controls what Chinese companies can publish online and sets ‘acceptable content’ policies that must be followed by web-based organisations doing business in China.

Musk wrote: “I want to do everything we can to maximise the use of technology to help achieve a better future for humanity. To that end, any area that contributes to a sustainable future is worthy of our investment.”

CAC is the Chinese government agency behind the ousting of Jack Ma, formerly chief of the Alibaba online retail giant and payments business Ant group. Mr Ma’s business success meant party chiefs saw him as a potential threat to their authority.

Mr Musk’s article was published in the CAC’s China Cyberspace journal alongside a similar piece from Eric Jing, the new chief executive of China’s Ant Group who took control after Mr Ma’s involuntary resignation.

The Musk business empire has three main pillars: Tesla, the electric car and commercial-scale battery business; Neuralink, which makes brain interface technology; and SpaceX, which specialises in reusable space rockets.

Dan Ives, a senior analyst at Wedbush Securities told the Telegraph that Mr Musk “needs to walk a tightrope when it comes to China as this region is the heart and lungs of the Tesla demand and production story.”

China accounted for about half of Tesla’s worldwide car sales last year and Mr Musk has faced questions in the West about the links between the Communist country and his business ventures. The Tesla chief executive has significant ties to China thanks to his company’s presence in the nation, mainly through its Shanghai automotive factory.

Mr Ives added: “Playing nice in the sandbox is important for Musk in China — and, ultimately, China likes having Musk and Tesla in their backyard.

When asked in May if he thought China might use Tesla as leverage over him to influence Twitter’s content and moderation policies, Mr Musk said: “I’ve seen no indications to that effect”.",2022-08-15T12:15:00+00:00,2022-08-15

407,10 Best Vanguard ETFs to Diversify Your Portfolio,"In this article, we discuss the 10 best Vanguard ETFs to diversify your portfolio. If you want to read about some more Vanguard ETFs to diversify your portfolio, go directly to 5 Best Vanguard ETFs to Diversify Your Portfolio.

The souring of the economy in the past few months has been a windfall for exchange-traded funds, which have witnessed a massive rise in demand, even among retail investors generally famous for attention towards the riskier growth sector. According to a report by news agency Reuters, retail investors are flocking towards funds like SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF, the iShares iBoxx $ Inv Grade Corporate Bond ETF, and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF as the economy slows, per data by investment bank JPMorgan.

Dave Nadig, the director of research at ETF Flows, says that a new series of exchange-traded funds launched recently, which will make it easier for people managing bond portfolios in a precise way. Nadig claims that the growth in bond ETFs has come as regulatory barriers that hindered institutional ownership are dropped. The analyst believes that fixed income is probably going to be “the growth story of the ETF space for the next four or five years”. Investments in defensive ETFs are also rising, per data from Morningstar.

Another trend sweeping the funds sector is the transition from mutual funds towards exchange-traded funds. A report from news platform Financial Timeshighlights that investors are selling out of bond mutual funds while maintaining their investments in exchange-traded funds. Morningstar data reveals that redemptions from US fixed-income funds amounted to over $200 billion in the first half of 2022. In the period between March and June, investors pulled over $137 billion from bond funds, the worst quarter for the industry since 1993.

In this overall market environment, investors are eagerly looking towards simpler investment strategies that charge low fees. Vanguard ETFs, founded by prolific investor Jack Bogle, focus on these two investor demands specifically. Vanguard offers over 80 exchange-traded funds for investors to choose from. Some of the top holdings of these funds include names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP). The funds are mostly actively-managed.

Vanguard funds manage over $7 trillion in assets for clients spread across the globe. Many investors on fixed incomes who want to build long-term portfolios often keep Vanguard holdings at the core of their investment strategies. There is a Vanguard fund for every type of investor at the market. For those who want a diverse portfolio, it may be prudent to invest in funds that cover broad areas of the market and provide investors with some much-needed cover against collapses or slowdowns in certain sectors.

Our Methodology

The ETFs listed below are discussed with regards to their top holdings. The aim of the article is to provide readers with a basic rundown of some of the top Vanguard ETFs in the US that have the best chance to provide investors with some diverse options in an uncertain economic environment.

9. Vanguard Value Index Fund (NYSE:VTV)

Vanguard Value Index Fund (NYSE:VTV) is a fund that tracks the performance of the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index. The index comprises value stocks of large companies that trade on exchanges in the United States. It has over $146 billion in net assets with a yield of 2.42%.

One of the biggest holdings of Vanguard Value Index Fund (NYSE:VTV) is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), a conglomerate with interests in the insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility businesses. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 104 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $19 billion in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), compared to 108 in the preceding quarter worth $19.3 billion.

“Diversified holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) reported strong earnings during the quarter and benefited from continued share repurchases below intrinsic value.

8. Vanguard Consumer Staples Fund (NYSE:VDC)

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm GQG Partners is a leading shareholder in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), with 9.9 million shares worth more than $1.5 billion.

7. Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSE:VOO)

Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSE:VOO) is a fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index. The index is widely considered the benchmark index of the US stock market and comprises 500 of the biggest companies in the US based on their market capitalizations. The fund aims to replicate the returns of the index by holding each stock in the same proportion as the index.

One of the biggest holdings of Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSE:VOO) is Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), a firm that markets electric vehicles and clean energy solutions. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 80 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $11 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 91 in the previous quarter worth $12 billion.

Here is what Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co. LLC has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“To put the demand growth for clean energy materials into perspective, let’s look at Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). At its Battery Day last year, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) projected three terawatt hours of lithium-ion battery capacity needed in 2030 for the EVs and storage they expect to produce. To reach this target, Tesla alone would gobble up approximately 75% of the world’s current nickel production and four times the world’s current lithium production. These numbers are astounding enough, but when one considers that EVs currently represent just 15% of global nickel demand and about 45% of lithium demand and that Tesla will likely be producing only a small proportion of the world’s EVs in 2030, the implications are staggering. Clean energy materials companies will make a lot more money in the decades to come than they ever have both because they will be selling a lot more metric tons of material and because there are certain to be shortages where supply can’t keep up with the rapidly growing demand.”

6. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (NYSE:VTI)

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (NYSE:VTI) is an exchange traded fund that invests at least 80% of net assets in securities on an index that comprises 100% of investable companies in the US stock market. The fund employs a sampling strategy to invest in securities on the index.

A key holding of the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (NYSE:VTI) is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a firm that makes and sells consumer electronics. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 131 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $182 billion in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 in the preceding quarter worth $186 billion.

Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that hedge funds are keeping a close eye on.

In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Berkshire Hathaway highlighted a few stocks and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here, our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. But consider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million. We spent no Berkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job. It’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amounted to a staggering $5.6 billion. Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, an act we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.”

409,The Company That Built Elon Musk's Tiny Home Has Now Raised Over $74 Million From Retail Investors,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk generated headlines last year when he announced in a tweet that he would sell almost all his physical possessions and will not own a house. Musk reportedly followed through with that plan and moved into a tiny house in Texas after disposing of all of his mansions.

Recent rumors suggested that Musk’s primary residence was a prefab house manufactured by Boxabl. It turns out, however, that the $50,000 foldable house is actually being used as a guest house.

What is Boxabl?

Boxabl is a rapidly growing startup that has gained popularity partially thanks to Elon Musk, but also because of the growing demand for tiny homes and a housing affordability crisis with no end in sight.

The company’s flagship product is the Boxabl Casita, a 20-foot by 20-foot accessory dwelling unit that can be delivered directly to a customer’s backyard and ready to occupy in an hour. The unit is fitted out as a studio apartment with a full-size kitchen, bathroom and living room and is expected to sell for $50,000.

The company recently completed a $9.2 million order for the U.S. government and has a waitlist of over 120,000 units. To fulfill the current demand, Boxabl is raising capital from institutional and retail investors to build the world's largest and most advanced housing factory.

Boxabl received a strategic investment from D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE: DHI), who agreed to share resources to help the company scale and placed an order for 100 units. The company is also raising capital on StartEngine through a Regulation A+ offering, which allows non-accredited investors to buy preferred shares with a $1,000 minimum investment.

The current crowdfunding campaign for Boxable on StartEngine has already exceeded $19 million in addition to over $55 million that was previously raised.

411,"Stocks gaining in early trading: Nvidia, AMD, Tesla, Moderna, Gilead","Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are moving in early trading.

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: All right, you mentioned some of the major averages. Let's take here a look at some of those major averages. For the Dow Jones Industrial average right now, still flat, just barely to the downside about 31 minutes into trade here on this Monday as we kick off a new trading week.

The NASDAQ composite, though, you mentioned that that's barely in positive territory. And that's exactly where we find ourselves right now, up just about seven ish points there. So we'll see if we can hold on to that and perhaps build on some of that move higher most recently here this morning in that slight candlestick higher.

And then additionally, just checking in on the S&P 500, you're also seeing that right now in negative territory. So mixed right now and hyper oscillating for some of the major averages, but for the S&P 500, down by about 1/10 of a percent.

I want to take a look at the heat map here real quick to see exactly where we've got some of the biggest movement taking place here today. I've been keeping an eye on some of the semiconductors here. You're seeing Nvidia having a decent day thus far. It's up by about 1%, also AMD up by about half a percent.

But then additionally, as we start to get into some of the other big tech names here, you're seeing even a name like Tesla here on the day, TSLA. That is up by about 2%. Some of the other major movers, shouting out Moderna here as we keep a close eye on that, shares popping there by about 4% on today's activity.

And then additionally here, let's also just take a look at Gilead as well, rounding out some of the broader biotech space. You're seeing that up by about 2.7%. So keep a close eye on some of those names as we move on throughout the rest of today's trading activity. You could see them trending on the Yahoo Finance platform as well online.",2022-08-15T14:20:35+00:00,2022-08-15
412,China’s Real Estate Market Crash Can Affect These 10 American Stocks,"In this article, we discuss the 10 American stocks that can be affected by China’s real estate market crash. If you want to read about some more American stocks that can be affected by China’s real estate market crash, go directly to China’s Real Estate Market Crash Can Affect These 5 American Stocks.

The real estate sector in China has been tethering on the brink of collapse over the past few months after real estate giant Evergrande, in August 2021, warned of liquidity and default risks if it failed to resume construction, dispose of assets, and renew loans. The liquidity crisis of Evergrande threatens to snowball into a much bigger problem for the Chinese economy since the company has investments in health, electric vehicles, cultural tourism, and technology businesses, some even outside China.

The real estate sector in China overall is facing the music of years of governmental neglect as well. S&P Global Ratings has already warned that nearly 20% of Chinese developers it rates are at risk of insolvency. Research firm China Index Academy claims that new housing sales shrank 27% on the year in volume in the first half of 2022 in 100 major cities in China. The crisis is spreading to banks as well. This is significant since 26% of total outstanding loans at Chinese banks are linked to the real estate sector.

A slowdown in the Chinese economy, the second-largest in the world, will have ripple effects across the world. In the US, the collapse of the Lehman Brothers led to a global financial meltdown. American stocks with strong exposure to the Chinese market, like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), are already feeling the heat of this developing situation, and the US trade war with China and COVID shutdowns are adding to the pressures.

Our Methodology

The companies that are based in the United States but have deep links with the Chinese economy were selected for the list. The business fundamentals of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

China’s Real Estate Market Crash Can Affect These American Stocks

10. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32

Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a Las Vegas-based corporation that owns and operates luxury hotels and casinos. The firm has strong exposure to the Chinese market and any slowdown in the Chinese economy will have disastrous consequences for the stock. This is illustrated by the recent earnings of the firm in which it missed market estimates on revenue by $72 million due to Macau uncertainty. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) has extensive operations in Macau and generates over 70% of its revenue from the area.

On August 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli maintained a Buy rating on Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock and lowered the price target to $85 from $92, noting that the firm was reporting better-than-forecast metrics from operations in Vegas.

At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 32 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $269 million in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), up from 29 the preceding quarter worth $260 million.

Just like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is one of the stocks that can be affected by the real estate market crash in China.

In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“In the most recent quarter, we exited the Fund’s holdings in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)  due to: (i) ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions in China, Macau, and Singapore; and (ii) the Macau government’s announcement to tighten its casino regulatory oversight.”

9. Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33

Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) makes and sells semiconductor products. The semiconductor firm has extensive links with Chinese companies working in the tech sector. A real estate crash in China is more than likely to affect manufacturing capabilities at these tech firms, which will hit Qorvo hard as it generates over half of its total revenue from shipments to the Chinese. The firm supplies chips to smartphones makers like Oppo and Vivo in China that have recently cut their sales estimates due to lower demand and currency devaluation.

On August 4, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss maintained a Buy rating on Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) stock and lowered the price target to $140 from $180, noting that smartphone weakness was a potential headwind for the firm.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Select Equity Group is a leading shareholder in Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) with 664,704 shares worth more than $82 million.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Vulcan Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO)  is one of the two major providers of radio frequency RF systems which are critical components of mobile devices including smart phones and the Internet of Things (IoT). Two transitory concerns have recently affected the company’s stock price. First, supply chain issues continue to be a constraint. Second, Apple recently announced its decision to decrease production of its iPhone SE model. Neither of these issues threatens their long-term competitive position. Qorvo’s value is stable and despite the recent pressure on the stock price, we feel its long-term prospects are promising.”

8. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) markets military aircraft, satellites, and missile defense systems. In the past five decades, the company has developed a lasting relationship with aviation authorities in China, regularly selling the country airplanes and aviation equipment. The trade war between the US and China in the past few years has hit this business of the firm, and any slowdown in the Chinese economy will further the pain. The Chinese market accounts for nearly a fourth of all airplane sales in the globe.

On August 1, Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag maintained an Overweight rating on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) stock with a price target of $215, noting that clearance for deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft was a positive catalyst for the firm.

At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 52 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.3 billion in The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), compared to 50 in the preceding quarter worth $1.1 billion.

7. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54

Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) markets construction and mining equipment. The company has been doing business in China since 1975. It generates around 25% of profits from the Asia-Pacific region, and although that includes sales in other countries, a major portion of this revenue comes from China. The firm has around 27 plants operating in the country and since these are all directly related to construction equipment, a real estate crash in the country would directly affect the revenue of the firm.

On August 3, UBS analyst Steven Fisher maintained a Buy rating on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stock and lowered the price target to $225 from $250, backing the firm to achieve margin expansion targets in the coming months.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), with 7.2 million shares worth more than $1.6 billion.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“We also initiated a position in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), one of the world’s leading manufacturers of construction and mining equipment. It’s a company we know well, as we have owned it in our large cap portfolio for quite some time. Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”

6. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a specialty coffee firm. China is the second-largest market for the company, following the US. Although the revenue exposure of the firm to the market is limited to less than 25%, any crash in the Chinese economy would directly weigh on the shares of the firm since it operates 16% of all its stores in China. In the third fiscal quarter, the firm generated nearly $545 million in revenue in a reopened Chinese economy. The firm controls nearly 35% of the coffee market in the Asian country.

On August 3, JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe maintained an Overweight rating on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock with a price target of $92, noting that an upcoming analyst day was an important event for the firm.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Fundsmith LLP is a leading shareholder in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), with 8.2 million shares worth more than $749 million.

In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the stocks with strong exposure to the Chinese market.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“We trimmed our positions in most of these companies in 1Q 2022 and sold our stake in Starbucks after a 12+ year holding period. In our view, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to be in a unique position to serve its customers who value the quality of its products and the convenient way they can be purchased. At the same time, Starbucks’ business is maturing in western markets, and its employee and store-related costs are growing, which should lead to slower earnings growth than we would prefer and further P/E multiple compression. We believe we have better opportunities as we continue to assess the impact of these issues for Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX).”

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Other headlines we're watching right now, Saudi Aramco saw a 90% jump in quarterly profit, marking its highest quarterly net income since going public in 2019. The profit happening, of course, on the back of higher crude oil prices, as Saudi Aramco generates billions in cash for the Saudi Arabian government. In the second quarter alone, Saudi Arabia's GDP grew 11.8% year over year. By the way, Aramco also did not raise its dividend as a part of this big earnings report.

Tesla has officially passed the 3 million vehicle mark for production. That's according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk. Musk congratulated the Giga Shanghai factory for making its one millionth car over the weekend. This follows months of shortages and lockdowns in China due to the country's COVID policies. In July of this year, Musk said the Fremont, California factory had produced 2 million cars.

Facebook users will soon be able to order food delivery from Facebook Marketplace. That's thanks to a new partnership between Meta and DoorDash. The two companies said they have already tested services in several US cities, but that the partnership is still in the early stages.

415,OPEN Stock: What Will a 2022 Housing Crash Mean for the “Amazon of Real Estate”?,"This article is excerpted from Tom Yeung’s Profit & Protection newsletter dated Aug. 12, 2022. To make sure you don’t miss any of Tom’s picks, subscribe to his mailing list here.

“Never get high on your own supply.”

“Don’t use what you deal.”

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Anyone who’s watched an episode of Breaking Bad or The Wire will have seen some version of this street-wise advice before.

But don’t try telling corporate America that.

In the years leading up to the financial crisis, bank bosses would start dabbling in the products they sold to customers. Subprime mortgages… Commodity futures… credit default swaps… These “prop trading” desks seemed to ask, “if our customers are making so much money from our products, why can’t we?”

Zillow Casts a Dark Shadow Over Opendoor’s Future

The same forces seemed to draw Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) into the same trap. In 2018, the online real estate aggregator decided it could make more money by using its pricing algorithm to trade houses…

…and $880 million of losses later, and it too is realizing why I rarely recommend companies that speculate on their own products. When a business specializes in market-making, alarm bells should ring if it starts “getting high off its own supply.”

But what about Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN), a company that specializes in trading these assets? Is it in the same boat as the prop traders that brought down Zillow’s iBuying program?

The Trouble with Opendoor’s Business

Opendoor is a real estate iBuying firm that aims to streamline the residential real estate business. In 2021, the company sold over 21,000 homes and generated $8 billion in revenue.

By all growth metrics, this company should look like a slam-dunk winner. The real estate market is notorious for its inefficiencies. On average, buyers take 30-45 days to close on a house, and Opendoor provides an alternative that can close homes in as little as 14 days.

For home buyers, the firm also provides significant savings. DIY buyers can tour homes without agents, saving thousands on broker fees. No surprise OPEN has notched a 83% compound growth rate since 2017.

Story continues

Yet, not all is well with the growing startup, as its “C-grade” quality score shows.

That’s because OPEN operates much like Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) in autos today, or prop-trading banks in subprime mortgages in 2007:

It gets high on its own supply.

In Q2 2022, Opendoor logged $6.6 billion of real estate on its books — about nine months of inventory. These houses, in turn, are funded by about $6.5 billion in asset-backed debt financing. It’s a powder keg of leverage that’s ready to go off.

As good as its pricing algorithms are, OPEN’s balance sheets will not escape a housing slump.

All else equal, a 10% gain in home prices would raise the firm’s equity value by $660 million, while a 10% loss would do the opposite. You don’t have to be a real estate speculator to know that such high loan-to-value ratios is a recipe for disaster.

A Black Swan Event Hiding in Plain Sight?

These risks have not gone unnoticed entirely. Since November, Opendoor’s shares have lost three-quarters of their value as investors have reconsidered the company’s leveraged positions.  A chart showing the price action of Opendoor OPEN stock.

Source: Chart Source Thomson Reuters

If real estate prices are up 17.5% in a year and your company still loses $274 million, something is clearly wrong.

But Opendoor’s management seems oblivious to such fears. Its annual report highlights interest rate risk as its only significant concern; management ignores the price risk of its 13,000-home inventory. And the firm doesn’t publish any stress-test reports – a major red flag for a company that owns almost as many finished houses as America’s largest homebuilder D R Horton (NYSE:DHI).

These are clear red flags. A crash in housing prices will reduce the carrying value of OPEN’s inventory. And such a drop will have knock-on effects on the firm’s finances. If the company’s equity base shrinks, that could trigger loan covenants, causing even more degradations in the firm’s credit, and so on.

It should surprise no one that OPEN’s 2026 bonds trade at 64 cents on the dollar.

What to Do with OPEN Stock?

None of this means Opendoor can’t succeed. Mature companies from commodity giant Glencore (OTCMKTS:GLNCY) to Japanese conglomerate Marubeni (OTCMKTS:MARUY) have long used their commanding market positions to earn billions from prop trading. And Opendoor’s position as a real estate marketplace may one day turn it into an “Amazon of real estate.”

But the promising company doesn’t make the core Profit & Protection “buy” list for its financial risk.

Instead, two tech-focused real estate firms make the list. One is already up 40% since I recommended it last month. It’s an asset-light real estate brokerage that I strongly recommended as a tactical play on near-term housing prices.

The other company is a longer-term strategic investment that’s up 8%. Buyers still have plenty of time to get in on this slow-burner.

To stay up-to-date with these picks, click here to subscribe to Tom Yeung’s Profit & Protection.

Take Opendoor’s Financials with a Grain of Salt

Scan OPEN’s financial records, and investors will quickly see a series of red flags.

Assumptions that interest expense will remain at 1%…

… A growth rate that seems too good to be true…

… A $62 million fine from the FTC over “deceptive” marketing…

The list goes on.

Sometimes, startups can overcome these hurdles by sheer force of will. Companies from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) adopted a “fake it ‘til you make it” attitude to raise billions in cheap capital and thrive.

But often, these types of companies go bankrupt like Pets.com or Henrik Fisker’s first electric vehicle company.

Now, InvestorPlace’s Eric Fry has assembled a list of 25 other popular stocks that he believes are “doomed firms” that are “all but assured to underperform in the next few years.” And it’s part of a presentation you should see today.

With black swan events seeming to happen more often than ever, it’s important for long-term investors to play good defense as well.

416,Stock Market Today: Dow in Turnaround as Tech Comeback Offsets Energy Wobble,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The Dow made a positive start to the week Monday, as rising tech and consumer stocks sparked a intraday turnaround and offset a slide in energy stocks amid fresh concerns about global growth.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%, or 151 points, after dipping nearly 180 points in intraday trading. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%, and the S&P 500 climbed 0.4%.

Growth sectors of the market, including tech and consumer discretionary, rebounded from session lows to help stocks move off the lowest levels of the day.

Retail and leisure stocks led the push higher in consumer stocks, shrugging off weaker-than-expected economic data from the China and U.S.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA), Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG) and Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP).

The August Empire State index, a measure of manufacturing activity in New York area, unexpectedly fell to -31.3 from 11.1, confounding expectations for a reading of 5.0.

Economists, however, downplayed the data, with Pantheon Macroeconomists reminding market participants that the “Empire State is a small regional survey and it is not definitive evidence of anything.”

The weaker-than-expected regional manufacturing report added to worries about economic growth following a slew of data overnight showing a slowdown in China industrial production and retail sales.

Treasury yields continued to retreat, pushing big tech into positive territory and extending gains following a more than 2% gain last week.

Snap (NYSE:SNAP), meanwhile, gained more than 5% after announcing that its subscription service Snapchat+ had surpassed 1 million paid users.

Energy, however, fell more than 1% as oil prices plunged as investors weigh the impact of slowing global growth on energy demand.

In other news, Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares were up 2% after after activist investor Daniel Loeb took a new stake in the company and called on it to consider spinning off its sports network ESPN.

Story continues

Walmart (NYSE:WMT), meanwhile, reportedly reached a deal with Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARAA) to offer Paramount+ streaming service to subscribers of Walmart+, the retailer's paid subscription service that provides a slew of benefits including free deliveries and fuel discounts.

Over the coming days, investor attention will shift to the strength of the consumer and monetary policy, with the release of retail sales data for July, and the minutes of the Fed's July meeting.

The minutes ""might offer few clues as to whether the FOMC will hike by 50bps or 75bps next month,"" Daiwa Capital Markets.

418,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk: We've built 3 million EVs, including 1 million in China","Tesla (TSLA) just crossed a major production milestone, but the leading EV-maker still has a long way to go to meet its ultimate goals and take on the growing competition.

In a tweet yesterday, CEO Elon Musk beamed:

Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M. pic.twitter.com/2Aee6slCuv

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 14, 2022

It’s an impressive total for the Shanghai factory, one that has been making EVs since the fall of 2019. Musk recently shared that Tesla’s Fremont factory had just produced its two millionth car in July, though Fremont has been building EVs since October of 2010.

Tesla’s march to 3 million vehicles produced all-time from its two main factories coincides with the beginning of the company’s ambitious growth plans.

In its Q2 shareholder letter, Tesla updated its installed annual capacity, or theoretical max production. Tesla said Fremont production capacity expanded to 650,000 vehicles from 600,000 last quarter, and Giga Shanghai’s capacity grew to 750,000 from 450,000. Meanwhile at new factories located in Austin and Berlin Tesla now claimed each factory has an installed capacity for 250,000 vehicles.

The Q2 update noted install capacity increased overall by nearly two-fold, meaning Tesla could theoretically deliver nearly 2 million of its EVs per year — a big jump for a company that delivered 936,000 vehicles in 2021.

Tesla has also stuck by its 50% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) target for annual deliveries, meaning the company will have to deliver around 1.4 to 1.5 million vehicles this year to hit that target. Since it has produced around 564K vehicles thus far in 2022, it has a long way to go in the back half of the year in order to reach its delivery goal.

Looking ahead to 2023, if Tesla maintains its 50% CAGR target it will need to produce 2.1 million to 2.2 million vehicles, which is theoretically possible but would mean all factories working at optimal production, with minimal periods of downtime. Recall just last month Giga Shanghai was shut down for a few weeks for upgrades, after being closed for a few weeks in the spring due to COVID-related shutdowns.

Story continues

While delivering over 2 million EVs in a year would be impressive, note that from an overall sales point of view Tesla is dwarfed by its traditional automaker rivals. Ford sold 3.9 million vehicles globally in 2021, and GM sold 6.3 million vehicles during the same time, all the while both companies were hamstrung by component and chip shortages.

By 2025 Ford (F) and GM (GM) aim to produce a combined 3 million EVs globally. Though that will be around the same figure Tesla aims to deliver by 2025, it does show that Tesla’s main U.S. rivals are catching up, and fast.

The main question for analysts and investors will be whether Tesla’s head start over its competition will keep it firmly in the driver’s seat well into the back half of this decade. Musk predicted two weeks ago that Tesla will make its 100 millionth vehicle in 10 years time.

420,7 Stocks That Love the Biden Climate Deal,"President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act passed in the House of Representatives late last week. The bill includes $369 billion in provisions related to climate and energy. Its passage paves the way for price gains for a select group of stocks to buy.

These funds are earmarked to benefit wind and solar power production while helping reduce the price of electric vehicles (EVs), making them more affordable to more Americans. Importantly, the bill also includes $1.5 billion to be used by oil companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the threat of penalty for failure to do so.

The bill will put the United States on a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% in 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Here are several stocks to consider which should benefit from Biden’s climate deal.

Most of the news surrounding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the last few days relates to CEO Elon Musk selling large chunks of its stock. The sales were catalyzed by an upcoming court case in which Musk may be forced to purchase Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

While the ongoing drama introduces volatility into Tesla’s share price, Biden’s climate deal serves as a strong tailwind. According to InsideEVs, the new EV tax credits “would be limited to trucks, vans and SUVs with suggested retail prices of no more than $80,000 and to cars priced at no more than $55,000.”

That means Tesla’s Model S, which starts above $100,000, would be ineligible. However, Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3 vehicles would both benefit from the tax credit. Model 3 car prices begin at just under $47,000 with the Model Y SUV starting at just under $66,000.

So, the tax credits should go a long way in states like California, where the Model 3 and Model Y are the number-one sellers and should help TSLA stock move higher.

Legacy automotive icon Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and its stock should benefit greatly from the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. In particular, Ford stands to benefit from the removal of former tax credit caps. Those caps previously limited the number of tax credits to the first 200,000 vehicles sold.

The cap has been removed with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. That means all EVs produced by a manufacturer will now be able to use the tax credit provided they meet the act’s other provisions. For Ford, this is a massive catalyst as it pivots toward increasing electric vehicle sales.

The reason is simple. Ford is planning to reach a 600,000 global EV run rate by 2023. That includes 270,000 Mustang Mach-Es in North America, Europe and China as well as 150,000 F-150 Lightning trucks in North America and 150,000 Transit EVs for North America and Europe. In other words, Ford no longer has to worry about how to allot 200,000 EV tax credits across its North American sales.

Even before the Inflation Reduction Act, there were signs that investing in GeneralElectric (NYSE:GE) stock is starting to make sense. One big reason is that GE is splitting into its constituent pieces in the next two years according to recent reports. And indications are that GE will be worth more in pieces than it is as a conglomerate of three current businesses.

As noted, the company currently consists of three headline businesses: GE Aerospace, GE Healthcare and its power and renewables business, which will be rebranded as GE Vernova. The good news here is that GE Vernova, although the least valuable of GE’s current businesses, directly benefits from the IRA act.

GE Vernova represents a portfolio of constituent businesses all related to new energy. The idea here is that the company will be able to move in a much more nimble manner once separated from its parent firm and will be able to capitalize on subsidies within Biden’s climate plan.

A month ago, solar stocks including Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) were looking to be heading downward. The catalyst: Sen. Joe Manchin was hesitant to support climate spending. The initial $550 billion earmarked for climate provisions was beyond what he would accept, as he believed it would serve to further increase inflation.

Manchin acquiesced to the bill’s passage after the value of climate provisions decreased to $369 billion in total. He only did so after conferring with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and receiving his assurance it wouldn’t increase inflation further. So, Enphase Energy is now in position to benefit whereas only a month earlier it was trading lower.

ENPH stock and company management certainly love the news. It should serve to draw more attention to the stock in the near future. Investors should tread carefully though — Enphase Energy shares are already fully priced on the back of multiple quarters of earnings beats.

NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) stock comprises the largest utility company in the U.S. and a clean energy business focused on wind and solar along with battery storage. The good news is no matter how you look at the company, it has performed quite well recently.

When the company released earnings in July the news was positive: Florida Power and Light, its utility business, saw net income increase to $989 million from $882 million in the previous quarter.

NextEra Energy Resources, its clean energy business, saw net income figures reach $133 million in the most recent quarter. That represented a drastic turnaround, as NextEra posted a $315 million loss in the same period a year ago.

Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act makes NEE stock much more attractive, as its provisions strongly incentivize the solar and wind power the company produces.

Biden’s climate deal is going to be a direct boon to TPI Composites (NASDAQ:TPIC) and firms like it. The Arizona manufacturer of composite wind blades now sits in prime position to benefit from rising sales moving forward.

Basically, there’s good reason to believe TPI Composites should see a spike in demand for its wind blades moving forward. That’s because the inflation Reduction Act extends the investment tax credits and production tax credits given to clean energy firms. Meanwhile, it also extends accelerated tax depreciation schedules that benefit firms.

Sales decreased 1.4% in Q2, falling to $452.4 million. But TPI Composites sold 783 of its blade sets during the period. That represented a 7.14% decrease. That means prices increased, and the company should see demand rise as Biden’s climate deal takes effect, so it’s in a strong position now.

Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is a clean energy company that owns a portfolio of renewable energy generation facilities. Those facilities span North America, Colombia, Brazil, Europe, India and China. The good news is the majority of production comes from its North American operations, making Biden’s climate deal a major boon for the firm.

The company experienced a 25% increase in revenues, reaching $1.27 billion in the quarter. That led to net income results that were 10.9% stronger overall and suggest BEP was investment grade prior to the Inflation Reduction Act.

421,Tesla CEO Elon Musk boasts production figure of 3 million EVs,"Yahoo Finance reporter Pras Subramanian discusses Elon Musk's recent comments about EV production, especially at Tesla's gigafactory in Shanghai.

Video Transcript

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I'm watching Tesla shares here. Elon Musk in a very joyous tweet, saying, Giga Shanghai had made over a million vehicles there and three million vehicles to date across all factories. A nice milestone but one that Tesla's keep improving on if it wants to hit its goals.

You know, the company targeting 1.4 to 1.5 million cars this year alone. And the year after likely targeting two million cars. This as competition from GM and Ford is heating up with those two automakers planning millions of EVs by 2025. So you know, a lot happening there in that space. Mid-decade and a decade is gonna be a huge competition, a battlefield between these brands here.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Pras, you mentioned that milestone number, three million vehicles that they have produced. Paling in comparison though, to so many of those larger automakers. Toyota, for example, producing over 10 million cars just last year alone.

So we know that Tesla has these very lofty goals of increasing production by 50%. But you certainly can see the difference here between Tesla and some of those more traditional automakers.

DAVE BRIGGS: Indeed. And clearly shaking off the impacts there of the Shanghai shutdowns. Pras, good to have you here, brother. Thank you.",2022-08-15T20:07:18+00:00,2022-08-15
422,3 Stock Winners and Losers of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act,"The House of Representatives passed the Inflation Reduction Act on Aug. 12. It now goes to President Joe Biden’s desk. The bill is expected to generate $739 billion in revenue, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

Of the $739 billion in revenue, $433 billion will be for new spending, while the remainder will be for deficit reduction. There will be winners and losers from the enactment of the IR Act.

According to the global law firm Dentons, $369 billion of the $433 billion in spending will be for tax credits to address climate change and energy security. The additional $64 billion in spending will be for a three-year extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The big winner from this legislation is the clean energy industry. The IR Act seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40% by 2030 through tax credits for businesses benefiting from the cleaning of energy. This includes electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, makers of equipment for generating clean energy, producers, alternative asset managers investing in clean energy and other related companies.

The biggest losers from the IR Act are pharmaceutical businesses. A significant component of the legislation is focused on reducing the cost of prescription drugs for people with Medicare through negotiated price reductions. Other losers are those who buy back a lot of stock each year and pay little in corporate taxes.

Here are my three stock winners and losers from the Inflation Reduction Act. They’re not what you’re expecting.

Clean energy-related companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) will benefit from the bill’s various tax credits made available including the Production Tax Credit and Electric Vehicles (EVs) Tax Credit. Rather than figure out which company will benefit the most, I believe it makes sense to buy the First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund (NASDAQ:QCLN), which invests in publicly-traded clean energy companies.

Story continues

Tesla is the second-largest holding with a 7.72% weighting. The NextEra play is through its publicly-traded renewable energy subsidiary, NextEra Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NEP). NextEra holds 55% of NEP’s voting rights. QCLN owns a total of 65 stocks ranging from a 10.45% weighting for Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) down to 0.03% for Romeo Power (NYSE:RMO).

The exchange-traded fund, or ETF, tracks the performance of the Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy Index. The index is reconstituted in March and September and rebalanced quarterly. The components are capped at 8%. If more than five securities have an 8% cap, the excess weight is distributed across all the remaining stocks in the portfolio.

Over the past year, QCLN is up 6% compared to a loss of 4% for the S&P 500. A rising tide lifts all boats, and QCLN makes sense if you want to ride the clean energy wave.

Stock Losers: First Trust Dow 30 Equal Weight ETF (EDOW) A stock market ticker tape reads ""Dow.""

The first of two losers, the First Trust Dow 30 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEARCA:EDOW) makes the list. Several of the 30 names in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)are large companies that pay very little in the way of federal income taxes.

In April, the Center for American Progress (CAP) reported that 19 Fortune 100 companies paid little or no federal income taxes in 2021. For example, Dow (NYSE:DOW) in 2021 had a $46 million tax benefit on its federal income taxes, 3.1% of its $1.5 billion pre-tax income. It’s a constituent of the DJIA and, as a result, an equal-weight holding in EDOW.

Other companies on CAP’s list include Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Nike (NYSE:NKE), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, all 30 of the companies in the DJIA could be affected by the IR Act, which implements a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax.

According to the Tax Policy Center, the tax is on average adjusted book income above $1 billion for U.S. companies and $100 million for foreign companies with U.S. income above that threshold. The tax is expected to apply to approximately 150 companies.

Who this tax ultimately affects won’t be known for some time. In the meantime, if you own any of the 30 names in the DJIA, EDOW or another ETF tracking the DJIA, you might face an additional headwind in 2023 and beyond.

To get the IR Act passed, the carried interest section of the legislation was removed to satisfy Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. In its place, a 1% excise tax on share repurchases was implemented. Interestingly, the 1% tax is expected to raise $14 billion in additional revenue above the $60 billion expected to be generated by taxing carried interest.

Some suggest companies will merely shift more of their free cash flow to increased dividend payments. However, if the estimates are correct and the 1% excise tax does raise $74 billion in 2023, the constituents of the Invesco BuyBack Achievers ETF (NASDAQ:PKW) would be affected slightly by the tax.

The companies held by PKW reduced their share counts by 5% or more in the trailing 12 months. This takes into account the net share reduction after share issuance is taken into consideration.

Because of its overall share count, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn’t make the list despite repurchasing billions upon billions of its stock each year. In April, Apple added $90 billion to its share repurchase program. If it buys back all of this stock, it would cost the company nearly $1 billion.

Are the names held by the Invesco BuyBack Achievers ETF going to buy back as much stock in 2023? Although that’s yet to be determined, their share repurchases are unlikely to be as robust next year. It’s something to keep in mind if you’re considering buying or already own PKW.

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

SEANA SMITH: Just about 90 seconds here from the closing bell. Jared Blikre has a closer look at some of these movers this afternoon. Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: Well, let's take a look at some of the action in the majors today. The NASDAQ is a leader. That is up 6/10 of a percent. All the majors did start out the day in red territory. However, have climbed back into the green. This would be the fifth week, fifth straight week for gains in the NASDAQ, as well as the S&P 500. But we got four days and change to go into the close.

Now, consumer staples, that is a leader today. That's up 1%, followed by utilities. That would normally be a defensive sector setup. But we also have consumer discretionary, tech, and healthcare and real estate. All of those are outperforming. And if we take a look inside the NASDAQ, we can see a lot of green here. Tesla is a standout. That is up 3%. Some pharmaceutical names, Gilead, Vertex, up 5%, 3% respectively.

And let me just show you. I've been away for a couple of weeks. Let me just show you how much each of these stocks is off their 52-week lows. So Tesla up 50%, Amazon up 41%, Apple up 34%, a lot of these names recently releasing earnings.

But I want to check out the retail sector because that is where we are going to go tomorrow. We have Home Depot and Walmart earnings on deck. We can see Costco up 1 and 1/2% today. But I'm going to close with the travel sector. We did get some green here. That is on the lowest close in crude oil in some time.",2022-08-15T20:28:48+00:00,2022-08-15

426,Druckenmiller Sold Big Tech in Bear Market as Soros Dove Back In,"(Bloomberg) -- Stanley Druckenmiller’s family office took a different approach than the investment firm of his former mentor, George Soros, as US stocks entered a bear market and reached their lows of 2022.

Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office sold its entire $199 million position in Amazon.com Inc. in the three months through June, while scaling back its stake in Microsoft Corp., according to the firm’s 13F filing Monday. Offloading big tech was a theme for the legendary investor in the first quarter, too, when the firm dumped about $274 million of Alphabet Inc. shares.

Soros Fund Management, by contrast, bolstered its stakes in Amazon, Salesforce Inc. and Alphabet in the second quarter, with all three ranking among its top 10 holdings as of the end of June. The firm also added a new $20 million position in Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc., though that represents only about 0.4% of Soros’s $4.6 billion US equities portfolio.

The S&P 500 Index plunged more than 16% in the second quarter, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped about 22%, as investors fretted that the Federal Reserve would tighten monetary policy enough to cause a recession as it fends off the highest inflation in decades.

Markets have been more sanguine of late. The S&P 500 is up about 18% from its low, set in mid-June.

“My best guess is that we’re six months into a bear market,” Druckenmiller said on June 9 at the 2022 Sohn Investment Conference. “For those tactically trading, it’s possible the first leg of that has ended. But I think it’s highly, highly probable that the bear market has a ways to run.”

Duquesne added some new positions in the second quarter: $96.3 million in Eli Lilly & Co., $38.7 million in Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. and $29.7 million in Moderna Inc.

Iconiq Capital, a multifamily office that has had billionaire Silicon Valley clients including Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and Reid Hoffman, also added to its tech positions. The firm reported a new $275 million position in DoorDash Inc. in the second quarter, while adding to stakes in companies including Alphabet and Meta Platforms Inc.

Iconiq uses its network to invest globally in startups, including Procore Technologies Inc. before its IPO last year. The cloud-based construction software company makes up almost a quarter of its $8.4 billion US equities portfolio.

David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management added to its stake in Meta Platforms, which tumbled 34% in the first quarter and another 27.5% in the three months through June. It reduced its exposure to Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.

Other billionaire family offices made more modest changes amid the market tumult.

An investment firm for the Walton family, which mostly buys and sells low-cost exchange-traded funds, added to its position in emerging-market stocks through the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (ticker: IEMG). The fund now makes up 12.6% of WIT LLC’s $4 billion US equities portfolio.

The firm didn’t add any new positions, but sold out of funds including the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (ticker: EWJ) and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (ticker: VBR). It also exited a small stake in Coinbase Global Inc.

Wildcat Capital Management, the family office of David Bonderman, added a new $10.2 million position in Global-e Online Ltd., while selling off Datto Holding Corp., which was acquired by Kaseya Ltd. in a deal valued at about $6.2 billion.

Hong Kong-based Blue Pool Capital, which manages part of the fortunes of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founders Joe Tsai and Jack Ma, sold an $8 million position in Mirion Technologies Inc. in the second quarter. Its $491 million US equities portfolio is now entirely invested in Blue Owl Capital.

427,UPDATE 1-Apple sets Sept 5 deadline for employees to return to office - Bloomberg,"(Add details on office days, background)

Aug 15 (Reuters) - Apple Inc has set a Sept. 5 deadline for corporate employees to return to office at least three days a week, a Bloomberg News report said on Monday.

The company, which told its employees of the new plan on Monday, will require employees to work from the office on Tuesdays, Thursdays and a regular third day that will be determined by individual teams, the report said.

The iPhone maker did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Apple joins several technology and finance companies that have begun mandating a return to office as COVID cases ease.

Earlier in June, Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has asked employees to return to the office or leave the company, according to an email sent to employees and seen by Reuters.

But Twitter was spared from producing documents for most of the employees Musk says are key witnesses on the bots issue.

Musk, whom Twitter sued to make him complete the deal, accused the company this month of hiding the names of workers specifically responsible for evaluating how much of the platform’s customer base is made up of spam and robot accounts. He asked the judge to force Twitter to identify them. So far Twitter has given up the names of “records custodians,” who aren’t as familiar with the data in question.

Read More: Musk Says Twitter Hiding Witnesses He Needs in Buyout Fight

On Monday, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick mostly denied Musk’s request in a one-page ruling, ordering that Twitter needn’t “collect, review, or produce documents” from any of the other 21 additional custodians Musk asked for.

The exception is Kayvon Beykpour, former head of consumer product, who was fired in May.

Beykpour was the top product executive at Twitter for years before he was unexpectedly dismissed by new chief executive officer Parag Agrawal. It was his product team that was most directly responsible for expanding Twitter’s user base -- and it is the quality of that base Musk has questioned in seeking to walk away from the deal.

Beykpour joined Twitter in 2015 when the company acquired his live video app, Periscope, and quickly climbed the ranks under former CEO Jack Dorsey. He was pushing Twitter into new product areas, like live audio spaces and newsletters, before he was ousted.

Story continues

The departures of Beykpour and Bruce Falck, formerly in charge of revenue product, reflected Twitter’s state of limbo while it awaited a new owner, a state now intensified by the litigation. Meanwhile a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting efforts have left some employees unsure of whether the projects or teams they are working on will be prioritized under new leadership.

Read More: Twitter to Freeze Hiring, Rescind Offers Ahead of Musk Deal

Lawyers for Twitter and Musk have issued a flurry of subpoenas to banks, investors and attorneys involved in the deal, as the two sides prepare for an Oct. 17 trial in Wilmington.

Twitter claims that Musk, the world’s richest person and the CEO of Tesla Inc., is using the concerns about spam and bot accounts as an excuse to get out of the transaction. Musk argues the company has failed to show that spam bots account for fewer than 5% of its active users, as it has said in regulatory filings.

The case is Twitter v. Musk, 22-0613, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

429,Apple Lays Off Recruiters as Part of Its Slowdown in Hiring,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. laid off many of its contract-based recruiters in the past week, part of a push to rein in the tech giant’s hiring and spending, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Most Read from Bloomberg

About 100 contract workers were let go in a rare move for the world’s most valuable company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. The recruiters were responsible for hiring new employees for Apple, and the cuts underscore that a slowdown is underway at the company.

Workers laid off were told the cuts were made due to changes in Apple’s current business needs. Bloomberg first reported last month that the company was decelerating hiring after years of staffing up, joining many tech companies in hitting the brakes. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook confirmed during Apple’s earnings conference call that the company would be more “deliberate” in its spending -- even as it keeps investing in some areas.

“We believe in investing through the downturn,” Cook told analysts. “And so we’ll continue to hire people and invest in areas, but we are being more deliberate in doing so in recognition of the realities of the environment.”

Apple is still retaining recruiters who are full-time employees, and not all of its contractors were fired as part of the move. An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the decision.

The move to lay off workers is unusual for the Cupertino, California-based technology giant, which employs more than 150,000 people. But it’s far from alone in taking such a step. In recent months, Meta Platforms Inc., Tesla Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. have all eliminated jobs in the face of a tech spending slowdown.

Story continues

Terminated contractors were told they would receive pay and medical benefits for two weeks. When they were laid off, employee badges were disabled and workers were told they would need to email a list of their belongings if they wanted those items to be returned. Recruiters were let go across many regions, including at Apple’s offices in Texas and Singapore.

Apple previously fired a large group of contract workers in 2019 in Cork, Ireland. At the time, the company had been relying on several hundred contractors to listen to recordings of Siri conversations to help improve the product. Apple let the workers go as part of scaling down the program in response to privacy concerns. The company also fired some contractors while working on the Apple Park campus in 2015.

Like many other companies, Apple employs contract workers for tasks such as technical support and customer service. It also uses contractors for localizing products and improving its Maps service. Contract workers typically receive fewer benefits than full-time workers and have fewer protections.

In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Fund mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 2003, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an Austin, Texas-based multinational automotive and clean energy company with a $940.1 billion market capitalization. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) delivered a -14.83% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 25.51%. The stock closed at $900.09 per share on August 12, 2022.

Here is what Baron Fund has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

""In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:

Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful.

Regardless, I was right to have spoken with Roger. That was since he outlined numerous issues we needed to consider, study, and question before we determined whether we believed Tesla could be a successful business…before we ultimately chose whether to invest in that company.

When we completed our initial due diligence on Tesla, which diligence has been ongoing since 2014, we decided to invest $360 million in Tesla over the next two years. I then called Roger and outlined why I thought we could earn 20 times our capital over the next 10 years. Roger was so certain I was wrong that he offered to bet me $1 million that Tesla would fail. “Roger, I can’t bet you a million dollars. First, if you are right, I couldn’t afford to pay you. Second, if I’m right, you’re my friend, and I couldn’t take your money.” We settled on a dinner bet..."" (Click here to see the full text)

432,Netflix Burns Shorts as ‘Extreme’ Bearishness Ebbs,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors who bet against Netflix Inc. in recent months might now be licking their wounds.

Shares of the streaming giant have surged 50% from their May low, buoyed by the promise of new features to revive growth, better-than-expected quarterly results and the runaway success of the latest installment of sci-fi thriller “Stranger Things.”

That’s hurting short sellers, who borrow shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference. Since mid-May, they have seen $996 million in mark-to-market losses, according to S3 Partners.

At its May low, Netflix was down 72% for the year as the company faced mounting competition, customers whose finances are getting pinched by rising inflation, the possibility of a global recession and the end of the pandemic-fueled streaming boom.

“Bearishness was extreme,” said Neil Campling, head of technology, media and telecom research at Mirabaud Securities. “The stock got to extreme oversold levels, and traded at a massive discount to trend valuation, to peers, and to history.”

To be sure, with the stock still down 59% in 2022, shorts that have been bearish since the start of 2022 are still sitting on $2.69 billion in mark-to-market profits, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.

The recent rally in Netflix’s shares reflects optimism about the start of a much-anticipated version of the streaming service that will carry advertising, a crackdown on password sharing and better-than-feared second-quarter subscriber loss. The company also forecast growth in its subscriber base after two quarters of contractions.

Bears who gave up on their bets may have added fuel to the surge. In the past month, short sellers have bought back about 2.4 million shares worth $599 million, according to S3 Partners. That’s an 18% decline in the total amount of shares shorted as Netflix rallied.

“Netflix shorts have been actively trimming their short exposure after the most recent earnings call -- looking for the worst to be over and for this quarter to reflect better earnings and\or user growth,” Dusaniwsky said.

Netflix shares are still cheaper than usual after their rebound. They’re priced at less than 23 times profits projected over the next 12 months, well below the 10-year average of 80 times. The Nasdaq 100 is at 24, while the S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio is 18.

Others are bracing for some volatility as competition concerns and rising costs aren’t going away any time soon.

“This stock can do very well over the next 12 to 24 months, but there will probably be a better entry point in the fall,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co.

Tech Chart of the Day

Tesla Inc. shares have rallied about 48% from the lows touched in late May. George Soros’s investment firm added a new $20 million position in the electric-car company, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. The shares, which are down 12% this year, rose in premarket trading Tuesday.

Top Tech Stories

Apple Inc. laid off many of its contract-based recruiters in the past week, part of a push to rein in the tech giant’s hiring and spending, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Apple set a Sept. 5 deadline for corporate employees to be in the office at least three days a week, marking its latest return attempt after Covid-19 spikes delayed its plans several times. Tencent Holdings Ltd. plans to sell all or much of its stake in food delivery giant Meituan to appease Beijing and lock in profits, Reuters reported, citing four sources with knowledge of the matter.

Shares of Meituan and other Tencent investees plunged on the news. Meituan slid more than 10% in Hong Kong, while Kuaishou Technology fell more than 5% and Bilibili Inc. dipped as much as 4.7%. Twitter Inc. was ordered to hand over files from its former consumer product head to Elon Musk on spam and bot accounts the billionaire has cited in seeking to abandon his $44 billion purchase of the social media company. Investment firms Tiger Global Management LLC and Soros Fund Management piled into some of the biggest technology companies weeks before big tech spiked on optimism the Federal Reserve’s tightening won’t be as aggressive as previously thought, the latest 13F filings show. Peloton Interactive Inc. is planning to redesign its bikes so that customers can self-assemble them at home and will explore letting users beam its content to rival workout machines, part of a wide-ranging turnaround bid under Chief Executive Officer Barry McCarthy. Fintech giant Ant Group Co.’s valuation was trimmed again by global investors who bought private shares ahead of its suspended initial public offering. The semiconductor market enjoyed a massive run-up in orders during the pandemic, sending sales and stock prices to new highs and triggering a global scramble to find enough supplies. There was hope in some circles that the boom could be sustained for several more years without a painful pullback, but chipmakers are now facing a familiar problem: growing inventory and shrinking demand.

433,"Buy, Sell or Hold: The 7 Biggest Analyst Calls of Last Week","While the biggest analyst calls garner the most attention, “buy,” “sell” and “hold” ratings from analysts are not always a good source for investors.

The reason is simple. The biggest analyst calls are often late in warning investors to sell a stock. For example, after a company reported a weak quarter, analysts rush in, after the fact, to downgrade the stock.

Readers need to question the motivation behind analyst buy calls. The analyst’s brokerage may have many clients who hold the stock. The bullish report would benefit them.

Despite the risks, analysts are influential. Their ratings can move the stock. In the last week, Tipranks tracked the biggest analyst calls that might interest investors.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) attracted a reiterated “buy” rating from analysts in the last two weeks. Although Telsey Advisory’s Joe Feldman set a $150 target, that wasn’t one of the biggest analyst calls this week. In fact, the average price target is $176.00.

Recently, Amazon agreed it would acquireiRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) for $1.7 billion. iRobot makes innovative cleaning products for the home. Its automated vacuum will complement Amazon’s suite of home solutions. For example, Amazon has Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa and Just Walk Out Technology.

Before it announced the deal, iRobot reported revenue of $255.4 million. This is down from the $365.6 million posted last year. The firm lost 35 cents a share on a non-GAAP basis.

Investors should expect Amazon’s smart home to integrate well with iRobot’s Roomba.

Amazon is building its in-house products. As a result, it does not need to rely on third-party sellers to make a profit on its e-commerce site. Instead, those sellers will attract customers. They may browse for Amazon’s television, Kindle, or smart home solution.

DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is worth at least 21% higher, according to analysts. Optimism improved after the online sports gambling site posted revenue rising by 56.4% to $466 million.

Analysts and investors are ignoring the weak fundamentals. Optimistic investors responded positively when DraftKings raised its fiscal year 2022 revenue guidance. It expects revenue of between $2.08 billion to $2.18 billion. This is only slightly higher than the previous range of $2.055 billion to $2.175 billion.

For the year, the company will lose between $765 million and $835 million. Still, the loss is smaller than the previous guidance of an $810 million to $910 million.

Monthly unique payers grew by 30% from last year to 1.5 million. DraftKings bucked the seasonally weak period. It benefited from a favorable sports schedule.

In addition, its marketing and promotion are attracting more users. Chief Executive Officer Jason Robins said that years of optimizing its marketing are paying off. Its business will fare better as it reaches at least 35% of the population.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) earned many “buy” ratings over two weeks ago. More recently, Needham reiterated a “sell” on META stock.

Meta is selling around $10 billion worth of debt in a jumbo deal. This corporate bond sale is Meta’s first.

In the last year, the stock fell sharply. Investors dumped the stock when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced IDFA. This protected consumer privacy but destroyed the ability for advertisers to get customer behavior and interests on Meta Platforms.

Meta did not say what it would do with the $10 billion. It could use the funds to support heavy capital expenditures. For example, the metaverse will cost billions annually for the next 10 years.

The company’s cash flow growth is slowing as user growth declines and advertising revenue dries up. Meta needs to sustain a rising cash burn rate to support its metaverse developments.

It could buy back its inexpensive shares. Management may bet that the market is undervaluing its stock. Still, the company must post user growth to justify a higher share price.

Rivian Automotive’s (NASDAQ:RIVN) Q2 results impressed Wedbush Securities. The firm believes that Rivian will capture the current and future electric vehicle demand.

Analyst Dan Ives cites a unique global total addressable market, thanks to Rivian’s core engineering and design.

Rivian has a nicely designed product. The engineering of its EV is not sufficiently unique to EV trucks offered by competitors.

In the last quarter, Rivian lost $1.89 a share on a GAAP basis. It posted revenue of $364 million. Citing headwinds in the supply chain environment, the company reaffirmed its production guidance of 25,000 units in output. It will cut its capital expenditure guidance to $2 billion while its annual EBITDA guidance is negative $5.45 billion.

Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough sees 2024 as a pivotal year. Gross margins should pivot to the positive. It will achieve economies of scale by ramping up production to 150,000 units. At that output rate, its fixed overhead will fall per unit. Costs will fall as Rivian leverages its large-scale production facility.

Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) fell after posting a fall in bookings. Analysts questioned its scalability.

Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak set a $32 price target. He said that the firm’s scale and profitability will take longer to achieve. Margins are still following.

Roblox posted revenue growing by 30% year over year to $591.2 million. Bookings fell by 4%, despite average daily active users rising by 21% year over year to 52.2 million. Hours engaged also increased by 16% year over year to 11.3 billion.

CEO Dave Baszucki said that the company has a responsive developer community. They are producing sophisticated, high-quality content.

The firm appreciates the developers are responding to the developer economy. This will lead to a rich pipeline of experiences. For now, the younger players who are 13 and younger are Roblox’s core business. However, the product pipeline might target older players.

Roblox needs to widen its revenue potential with the older game player. It cannot depend on parents to fund their children’s gaming credits.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rebounded sharply in recent weeks. This attracted a buy rating from analysts.

Recently, two members of Congress asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for a briefing regarding the ongoing probes over Tesla crashes.

The NHTSA is investigating Tesla’s AutoPilot and advanced driver assistance systems. The EV giant could damage its brand if the Administration found that Autopilot caused too many crashes.

CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla deployed its FSD beta to over 100,000 owners. It has now driven over 35 million miles with FSD beta. CEO Musk said that Tesla is on track to release the FSD beta to all North American customers before the end of the year.

The company is waiting for Europe to approve the technology.

Tesla is managing cost inflation well. It procured around 1,600 unique pieces of silicon from 43 semiconductor companies. Fortunately, it has strong margins for those inputs. Furthermore, the company increased its cell production. It also has long-term contracts with all of its partners for key battery metals.

Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) bottomed in the low $90 during the market’s summer downturn.

DIS stock perked higher after analysts cited the strong theme park performance. KeyBanc analysts raised their target to $154. Analyst Brando Nispel liked Disney’s strong TV and parks business. The analyst noted that churn remained low despite the company increasing streaming prices by 38% year over year.

Jessica Reif Ehrlich, a Bank of America analyst, sees a path to profitability for Disney’s streaming service. The unit will benefit from price hikes and a strong content plan. More importantly, the analyst does not think that Disney is relying on Marvel and Star Wars, their core brands.

Disney’s theme park is rebounding. Demand is not abating at all, according to CFO Christine McCarthy. The park has days when people cannot even get reservations.

The company’s parks have room to grow. The international business is recovering. It is still below past profit margins. Management is cautiously optimistic that international countries will not impose a lockdown in response to a future outbreak of Covid.

The electric vehicle industry has been battling with multiple challenges in the past few months. A post-pandemic rise in EV demand led to a semiconductor chip shortage around the world in 2021, resulting in a dramatic rise in chip prices and causing massive delays in production at even established EV manufacturers. The supply chain issues that led to the chip shortage also triggered soaring inflation, forcing the Fed to hike interest rates, creating an environment where recessionary fears hit the EV market just as production numbers were rising again.

Prominent EV materials stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) faced the brunt of this crisis, registering a 22%, 28%, and 26% year-to-date drop in the share price as of August 15, respectively. However, the tide is beginning to turn again. Inflation numbers are peaking just as steel and chip prices go down. The Russian war in Ukraine has resulted in a jump in fossil fuel prices, accelerating the shift towards electric vehicles.

S&P Global forecasts that electric vehicle sales in 2022 will nearly triple compared to 2020 numbers. This rise is forecast despite the fact that the prices of lithium, one of the most critical components of EV batteries, have increased seven times in the period between May 2021 and May 2022. The prices of nickel, another important EV component, have also increased due to the Ukraine war since Russia controls 20% of the global supply of the metal. The successful passage of the recent climate change bill in the US will also benefit EV stocks.

In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details.

437,New lithium supply threat looms as heat wave forces China to cut electricity to factories,"Yet another lithium supply-chain snag is about to be served up to the world, as a record-breaking heat wave in China is forcing electricity cuts in a critical hub for the country’s lithium production empire.

A “red warning” of high temperatures across central China was issued over the weekend by the country’s meteorological administration.

Temperatures in several Chinese provinces are currently well above 40°C (104°F), and Chinese meteorologists consider this heat wave the strongest to hit China in six decades, state-affiliated outlet Global Times reported.

One of the jurisdictions afflicted by the suffocating heat is China’s Sichuan province, a regional powerhouse behind the economies of central and western China, and a manufacturing centerpiece for a commodity of extreme importance to global markets and technology firms: lithium.

China’s lithium heartland

China is the undisputed world leader in lithium processing, and Sichuan has one of the country’s largest deposits of the metal essential for the production of everything from electric vehicles to smartphone batteries.

The wealth in Sichuan’s lithium reserves has made the province’s mines the target of multiple multimillion-dollar deals with electric-car makers in recent years.

Earlier this year, a majority stake in a western Sichuan mine reportedly holding 724,000 tons of lithium sold at auction for nearly $300 million to a Chinese tech company specializing in making electric vehicle batteries reusable.

In 2020, a Sichuan-based mining group struck a five-year lithium supplying deal with Tesla, worth up to $880 million.

But Sichuan’s lucrative lithium processing industry could be coming to a temporary standstill, as the country’s scorching heat wave is crippling the energy systems that power it.

How is a heat wave affecting electricity?

The elevated temperatures in Sichuan are dealing a direct hit to the province’s primary energy-supply system: hydropower.

In 2018, 87% of Sichuan’s energy was generated from hydroelectric power stations, but this summer’s punishing heat wave, combined with low rainfall, has led to dry rivers across the province, state media reported, and is forcing the Sichuan energy authority to evaluate where to cut back on electricity usage.

Story continues

Until next Saturday, industrial power cuts will be applied to 19 cities and prefectures across the province, Global Times reported on Monday. The power cuts to factories are intended to leave more energy aside for residential use. Several lithium processing plants in these areas have already suspended operations for this week.

It would be the latest snarl in a convoluted and increasingly precarious global supply chain for the metal, as lithium supply is barely able to keep pace with mounting demand as the world accelerates its shift toward clean energy and battery-powered vehicles and electrical grids.

Electric-car makers including Tesla CEO Elon Musk have warned this year that the demand-supply mismatch is already sending prices for lithium soaring, as the rate of extraction and processing has yet to catch up to the market. Experts say lithium processing times will have to become much faster and more streamlined over the next decade to keep up with projected demand.

440,Inflation Reduction Act is a ‘rising tide for the entire electric vehicle industry’: Analyst,"Later today at the White House, President Joe Biden will put the final touches on a major win for his administration, signing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law.

Within the $700 billion package are huge investments in new climate initiatives, such as rebate programs for energy efficient appliances and retrofits, production tax credits, and provisions for battery and solar cell manufacturers, and most importantly for the automakers, tax credits for new and used electric vehicles.

“Now that we have $370 billion coming from the Inflation Reduction Act, we expect that to continue to accelerate the growth of electric vehicles and really help companies along the value chain from car manufacturers to battery manufacturers to lithium suppliers to parts all involved in electric vehicles to benefit from this bill,” said Jay Jacobs, BlackRock U.S. head of thematic and active equity ETFs in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live. “We believe we're going to see a really rising tide for the entire electric vehicle industry.” Electric car in charging

Jacobs manages a number of ETFs under the iShares umbrella, which BlackRock owns. Among those is the iShares Self-Driving Ev and Tech ETF (IDRV), which invest in the entire value chain of electric and autonomous vehicles. Jacobs believes ETF offerings in the space are the best way for investors to get exposure to the industry because there are a number of smaller companies and foreign firms that are going to benefit from the IRA beyond big names like Ford (F), GM (GM) and Tesla (TSLA).

“Well, I think it's really going to be felt across the entire value chain. I mean, this is the birth of a new industry. This is a revolution in transportation,” Jacobs says. “It's not going to be one winner, we think there's going to be many winners in this space and it's going to expand beyond just passenger vehicles. We're going to get into trucks, we're going to get into alternative forms of transport.

Looking past transportation, Jacobs noted the “global clean energy chain at large” will benefit tremendously from implementation of the IRA.

In this space Jacobs said clients are interested in the iShares Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) because companies held by the ETF will benefit from the IRA’s focus on providing production tax credits to manufacture items like solar panels and wind turbines. The ETF also owns utilities, who will be implementing new clean technologies and produce electricity using solar and wind, as well as hydrogen and other forms of clean energy that the IRA is incentivizing.

442,German court lets Tesla ads continue referring to autonomous driving,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla can continue referring to the capabilities of its driver assistance system and to autonomous driving in its advertising in Germany after a court threw out a complaint against the practice.

Germany's Wettbewerbszentrale, an industry-sponsored body tasked with policing anti-competitive practices, had filed the so-called non-admissibility complaint with Germany's Federal Court of Justice.

A spokesperson for the court said the complaint had been rejected on July 28, effectively allowing Tesla to keep using the phrases ""full potential for autonomous driving"" and ""Autopilot inclusive"" in its German advertising materials.

Industry publication Teslamag first reported the rejection earlier this week.

The complaint by Wettbewerbszentrale came in response to a ruling by the higher regional court Munich in October 2021 that confirmed an appeal by Tesla against a previous verdict by a lower district court that prohibited the use of the phrases.

Tesla earlier this month was also accused by a California state transportation regulator of falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features as providing autonomous vehicle control.

447,Tesla Whipsaws After Stock Rallies 50% From Its May Bottom,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. whipsawed Tuesday after a relentless surge that pushed the stock up 50% from its May bottom lost some momentum, with investors broadly souring on growth stocks.

The electric-vehicle maker fluctuated after jumping as much as 1.7% earlier in the session, which took the stock up 50% from the May 24 closing low of $628.16. The shares currently remain about 27% below their all-time high of $1,243.49 reached on Nov. 4.

While Tesla investors have been through a tumultuous 2022, with the company tackling several challenges, the shares have been recovering at a torrid pace. They posted a 32% gain in July for Tesla’s best month since October, as resilient second-quarter results, a climate change bill from the Biden administration and an overall cautiously optimistic mood in the markets helped boost the stock.

Still, most of the risks that weighed on the company earlier this year are lingering -- supply-chains are far from sorted, China’s troubles are building further and the broader-market sentiment is uncertain.

Meantime, Elon Musk’s tussle with Twitter Inc. continues. Earlier this month, Tesla’s chief executive officer offloaded $6.9 billion worth of Tesla stock to accumulate cash ahead of a trial on the Twitter issue.

The company held its annual general meeting on Aug. 4, where its investors voted to approve a 3-for-1 stock-split. The shares will start trading on a split-adjusted basis on Aug. 25.

It will be Tesla’s second share-split in less than two years. The last time the company had executed a similar move was in 2020, a five-for-one stock split that led to a 60% surge in the share price from the day of the announcement to the execution date.

449,Musk Among Guests as McCarthy Raises Money on Cheney’s Home Turf,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk is among the guests at a Wyoming event hosted by House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy the same day that Representative Liz Cheney faces a likely primary loss to a challenger backed by the Republican establishment, according to a person familiar with the plans.

McCarthy refused to confirm or deny Musk’s attendance. “I am not going to talk about that,” he said in a telephone interview from his hotel room in Teton Village, Wyoming. Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment about Musk or his plans.

The event is “for members, donors and candidates,” McCarthy said.

Musk, whose SpaceX has operations in McCarthy’s Bakersfield, California-area district, has donated to Republican and Democratic candidates and campaign committees since making his first contribution in 2003. His biggest investment, some $128,900, has been in committees connected with McCarthy. He’s also become increasingly vocal on political issues.

The event at a resort in Teton Village, not far from Cheney’s home, is another illustration of how much of a pariah the state’s lone House representative has become within the Republican Party because of her vocal and persistent criticism of former President Donald Trump over his role in the insurrection at the US Capitol.

It’s unusual for a party leader in the House to campaign against an incumbent in a primary, but McCarthy, who hopes to be elected House speaker if Republicans win control of the chamber after November’s midterm election, threw his support behind conservative lawyer Harriet Hageman early in the campaign.

McCarthy, who’s been a staunch Trump ally, said in the interview that he’s confident Hageman will defeat Cheney and that she “is going to be a great representative” for Wyoming. He said he’s already made plans to put Hageman on the Natural Resources Committee.

Story continues

More than McCarthy, it was Trump’s backing of Hageman and his verbal attacks on Cheney that have contributed to the three-term incumbent’s trouble in Wyoming. That trouble has only increased as Cheney has taken a prominent role in the special House committee investigating the storming of the Capitol last year by a mob of Trump supporters.

Cheney has said Trump “tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power.” Her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, recorded a campaign ad in which he labeled Trump a “coward.”

The latest poll in the state, by the University of Wyoming’s Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center, showed 57% of likely Republican primary voters support Hageman, while only 28% support Cheney.

453,UPDATE 4-Elon Musk says he is buying Manchester United,"(Adds background on Musk and Manchester United)

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Elon Musk, the world's richest person, on Tuesday tweeted that he was buying football club Manchester United Plc, without offering any details.

Musk has a history of being unconventional and making irreverent tweets, and it was not immediately clear whether he planned to pursue a deal to secure Manchester United.

""I'm buying Manchester United ur welcome,"" Musk said in a tweet. The team is controlled by the American Glazer family. Neither the family nor Musk immediately responded to a request for comment.

British newspaper The Daily Mirror reported last year that the Glazers were prepared to sell the club but only if they were offered in excess of 4 billion pounds.($4.84 billion)

Musk is currently trying to exit a $44 billion agreement to buy the social media company, which has taken him to court.

Manchester United is one of the world's best supported football clubs. They have been champions of England a record 20 times and have won the European Cup, the most prestigious club competition in the global game, three times.

Dissatisfaction among fans at the Glazers' perceived lack of ambition to bring in top players intensified after the club finished sixth in the English Premier League last season, while crosstown rivals Manchester City won a second successive title.

The football club had a market capitalisation of $2.08 billion, as of Tuesday's stock market close.

Manchester United fans have in recent years protested against the Glazers, who bought the club for 790 million pounds ($955.51 million) in 2005, due to the team's struggles on the pitch.

The anti-Glazer movement gained momentum last year after United were involved in a failed attempt to form a breakaway European Super League.

Some fans have urged Musk to buy Manchester United instead of buying Twitter.

Musk has a history of unconventional actions and comments, making it difficult sometimes to tell when he is joking.

Story continues

His ambitions range from colonising Mars to creating a new sustainable energy economy, and in the process he has built the most valuable car company in the world, electric vehicle maker Tesla, rocket company SpaceX, and a slew of smaller firms. One is a tunnel maker called the Boring Company.

Musk has appeared to smoke marijuana in a podcast and fought U.S. regulators over his comments about his plans for Tesla, including an abandoned effort to take it private.

Forbes estimates his fortune at $270 billion. ($1=0.8268 pounds) (Reporting by Juby Babu in Bengaluru; Writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Aditya Soni, Neil Fullick and Michael Perry)",2022-08-17T00:17:22+00:00,2022-08-17
454,Musk says he backs moderate Republicans and Democrats,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he backs moderate Republicans as well as moderate Democrats, just three months after announcing that he would vote for Republicans.

""To be clear, I support the left half of the Republican Party and the right half of the Democratic Party!"" the billionaire wrote on Twitter on the day he was due to attend a fundraiser for top U.S. House of Representatives Republican Kevin McCarthy, according to the New York Times.

That fundraiser was to be held in Wyoming, where Republican U.S. Representative Liz Cheney faced a primary challenger from within her own party who former President Donald Trump backed because Cheney supported impeaching him after his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Cheney was stripped of her House Republican leadership roles after criticizing Trump.

Musk in a May tweet said that he had voted for Democrats in the past but that his future votes would be for Republicans.

Musk frequently comments on politics, saying earlier this summer that he was leaning towards supporting Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis for president in 2024 and that Trump was too old to serve as president again.

In June, President Joe Biden compared Tesla unfavorably to Ford Motor Co, while sarcastically wishing Musk ""lots of luck"" on his ""trip to the moon"" after the billionaire expressed reservations about the economy.

Musk has frequently fired off harsh tweets directed at the president and has been critical of Biden's union-first, subsidy-heavy approach to building the electric vehicle market.

The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and world’s richest person made the claim in a tweet thread where he stated he supported the left half of the Republican Party and the right half of the Democrats.

Musk has a track record of using Twitter to make jokes and troll the media, who follow what he tweets closely. He has also run afoul of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, most infamously for tweets in 2018 about taking Tesla private. That led to securities fraud charges, and a settlement that included appointing a “Twitter sitter” to approve Musk’s Tesla-related tweets.

More recently, he has drawn scrutiny from regulators over a May 17 tweet that his $44 billion takeover bid for Twitter Inc. “cannot move forward.” Musk backed away from the purchase last month, spurring a lawsuit from the company to make him complete the deal.

The latest tweets could also attract regulatory attention, given Manchester United securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The Class-A shares have fallen 10% this year.

Manchester United is valued at $4.6 billion, according to Forbes. In the most recent sale of a Premier League powerhouse, a group led by Todd Boehly agreed to buy Chelsea FC from sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich for £4.25 billion ($5.1 billion), including future investments.

Manchester United, which has won a record 13 Premier League titles, is currently last on the table after a disastrous start to the season under new coach Erik ten Hag. It lost its two opening games -- including a 4-0 defeat to Brentford on the weekend.

Fans have protested the performance of the storied club under the ownership of the Glazer family, which also owns the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers. At the opening home game of the season -- a 2-1 loss to Brighton -- a large group of fans walked toward the stadium with banners that read: “Fight greed. Fight for United. Fight Glazers” and “We want our club back,” the Telegraph newspaper reported.

Manchester United won its last Premier League title under legendary coach Alex Ferguson in the 2012-13 season, and has since fallen behind crosstown rival Manchester City, which has won four of the past five titles. Wantaway star striker Cristiano Ronaldo will be allowed to leave Manchester United this summer if he can find a club to buy him, the Telegraph reported.

Musk has a history of being unconventional, posting irreverent tweets, and it was not immediately clear whether he planned to pursue a Manchester United deal.

Below are some other tweets by Musk - who has more than 103 million followers - which have taken investors, Twitter users, Twitter's board and the rest of his audience than by surprise.

May 13, 2022: ""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users."" Twitter had agreed with Musk on his $43 billion takeover of the social media company, after initial hiccups, and its shares fell sharply after Musk's tweet.

The billionaire later terminated the deal saying that Twitter withheld information about these accounts, and the two sides are currently readying for a trial scheduled to begin Oct. 17 in Delaware.

April 27, 2022: ""Next I'm buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in."" Musk's tweet, an apparent joke, came days after he made his buyout offer for Twitter.

Aug. 7, 2018: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" Musk was not close to taking Tesla private and had not lined up financing, and the number 420 is closely associated with marijuana use. Tesla shares jumped, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission went on to sue Musk, saying he had misled investors.

April 1, 2018: ""Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt,"" Musk said in an April Fool's day tweet. Tesla shares fell 5.1% the following day.

Jan. 27, 2018: ""When the zombie apocalypse happens, you'll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!"" Musk's Boring Co sold flamethrowers and hats to raise funds for its Hyperloop transportation project.

July 25, 2017: ""I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited."" Musk was targeting Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc, who downplayed Musk's warnings about the danger of artificial intelligence.

March 12, 2015: ""The rumor that I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet Mars is totally untrue."" Musk has said he wanted his company SpaceX to develop a rocket capable of an unpiloted trip to Mars in 2022, with a crewed flight two years later.

458,Elon Musk Tweets He’s Buying England’s Manchester United Soccer Team,The billionaire’s post comes amid a court battle over whether he can walk away from a $44 billion agreement to buy Twitter.,2022-08-17T03:51:00+00:00,2022-08-17
459,UPDATE 8-Elon Musk says he was joking about buying Manchester United,"(Adds Musk's new tweets, background on Manchester United and Musk's stock sales)

Aug 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk, the world's richest person, said early on Wednesday that he was joking when he tweeted hours previously that he was going to buy currently struggling English football club Manchester United Plc.

""No, this is a long-running joke on Twitter. I'm not buying any sports teams,"" Musk posted when asked by a user if he was serious about buying the club. ""Although, if it were any team, it would be Man U,"" he added, ""they were my fav (sic) team as a kid.""

Musk originally tweeted: ""I'm buying Manchester United ur (sic) welcome,"" without offering any details. Some Manchester United fans, disgruntled by their club's declining fortunes of late, had previously urged Musk on Twitter to consider buying the club.

The tweet turnaround comes as Musk seeks to exit a $44 billion agreement to buy Twitter only four months after announcing on the platform he would buy the social media company, which has taken him to court.

Musk has a history of being unconventional and posting irreverent tweets, making it difficult sometimes to tell when he is joking.

""Next I'm buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in,"" he tweeted on April 27, two days after Twitter's board accepted his unsolicited offer to buy the company.

Referring back to that post, on Wednesday he tweeted: ""And I'm not buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in, despite the extreme popularity of such a move.""

Musk's tweets about potential acquisitions have landed him in hot water with U.S. regulators in the past.

In 2018, he tweeted that there was ""funding secured"" for a $72 billion deal to take Tesla private, but did not move ahead with an offer. Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines - and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman - to resolve U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claims that Musk defrauded investors.

Story continues

The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk's tweet that he was buying the club outside usual business hours.

Musk's ambitions range from colonising Mars to creating a new sustainable energy economy, and in the process he has built the most valuable car company in the world, electric vehicle maker Tesla, rocket company SpaceX, and a slew of smaller firms. One is a tunnel maker called the Boring Company.

WIDESPREAD OPPOSITION

Manchester United is one of the most famous names in world football but is currently in crisis on the field amid angry calls from fans for the club's current owners, the American Glazer family, to pull out.

Clamour from fans and pundits for a change of ownership at the three-time winners of the European Cup, the most prestigious club competition in the global game, is intensifying amid a lengthening run without winning major titles.

British newspaper The Daily Mirror reported last year that the Glazers, who have faced widespread fan opposition to their stewardship since acquiring the club in 2005 for 790 million pounds ($957 million), were prepared to sell but only if they were offered in excess of 4 billion pounds.

In its annual rankings this year, Forbes rated Manchester United, with its huge global fanbase, the third most valuable football club in the world, worth $4.6 billion, behind only Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.

But shares in the New York-listed football club have slid a quarter in the past 12 months, valuing it at just over $2 billion. The stock has rebounded in the past month, gaining 16% to close at $12.78 on Tuesday.

The northern England-based team has more than 32 million followers on its main Twitter account and Musk's first tweet about the club had garnered more than 430,000 'likes' on the platform within five hours.

Musk, who is worth $270 billion, according to Forbes, could certainly afford to buy the club.

Last week, filings revealed that Musk had sold $6.9 billion worth of Tesla shares, which he said could be used to finance a potential Twitter deal if he loses a legal battle with the social media platform.

In total, Musk has sold about $32 billion worth of Tesla stock in less than a year partly to pay tax obligations and finance a Twitter deal.

Musk and his lawyer did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on his original Twitter post before his message that he had been joking. The Florida-based Glazer family did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

462,Exclusive-China's EVE to supply BMW with large Tesla-like cylindrical batteries in Europe -sources,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's EVE Energy Co Ltd will supply BMW with large cylindrical batteries for its electric cars in Europe, two people with knowledge of the matter said, as the German automaker follows Tesla Inc in adopting the new technology.

EVE has signed contracts to be BMW's primary supplier of the battery cells in Europe for its new series of electric vehicles due to hit the market from 2025, said one of the people who has direct knowledge of the deal.

Tesla this year started manufacturing its new larger-format 4680 cylindrical battery - denoting 46 millimetres in diameter and 80 millimetres in length. It has said it expects the battery to lower production costs and improve range compared to the current-generation 2170 cylindrical battery.

Guangdong-based EVE's batteries will be similar in size, said the sources, who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Company filings also show EVE is planning a large cylindrical battery plant in central China.

EVE, a supplier to BMW in China, did not respond to a request for comment. BMW said it plans to release some battery-related news in early September but declined further comment.

The shift by BMW, which currently uses prismatic batteries, underscores growing momentum for larger-format cylindrical batteries. Prismatic batteries, which are rectangular in shape, have become the most common form of auto battery in the past two years as they can be more densely packed, saving on costs. But proponents of cylindrical batteries argue the newer larger format cells have become more cost-effective due to improvements in energy density.

China's CATL, the world's largest battery maker, is also due to start supplying cylindrical batteries to BMW from 2025.

Expectations are high that these batteries will also be large-sized cells. CATL did not respond to a request for comment on planned dimensions.

It was not immediately clear how many batteries BMW plans to procure from EVE and CATL.

Story continues

EVE's deal with BMW prompted the Chinese company to announce in March that it would build a cylindrical battery production facility in Debrecen, Hungary - its first plant in Europe, according to the person with direct knowledge of the deal.

BMW is also constructing a plant in the same city where it plans to produce EVs developed on its Neue Klasse platform.Government incentives are driving demand for EVs in Europe and the United States, spurring Chinese battery and EV makers to accelerate plans to set up production bases overseas.

CATL announced last week it would build Europe's biggest battery plant with annual capacity of 100 gigawatt hours, also in Debrecen, to supply European automakers. Mercedes-Benz will be its largest client.

With much of fresh battery demand likely to be for large cylindrical cells, Chinese battery makers which have relied on a huge domestic market where prismatic cells reign, will have to change tack like EVE and CATL, said Duan Bing, an analyst at Nomura.

Eve, founded by lithium-ion battery researcher Liu Jincheng in 2001 and also a supplier to Xpeng Inc, is a much smaller player than CATL. It ranks eighth with 2.3% market share in China, according to data from the China Automotive Battery Innovation Alliance.

By comparison, CATL makes 47.6% of the total batteries installed in EVs in China.

468,5 High-Flying US Bigwigs With Solid Upside Left to Buy Now,"Wall Street has been enjoying an impressive bull run for the past one and a half months after completing a terrible first half of 2022. Although the three major stock indexes are in negative territory year to date, their recovery from the recent lows recorded i mid-June is incredible.

From Jun 17 to Aug 16, the Dow advanced 15.2% and the S&P 500 appreciated 18.4%. As of the same date, the Nasdaq Composite surged 24% since Jun 16. We have selected five U.S. corporate behemoths with a favorable Zacks Rank that have provided higher returns than the market’s benchmark S&P 500 Index in the past month.

These companies are — Tesla Inc. TSLA, Airbnb, Inc. ABNB, Cadence Design Systems Inc. CDNS, Texas Instruments Inc. TXN and NextEra Energy Inc. NEE.

Future Catalysts of U.S. Economy

On Aug 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed a $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act. The size of the allotted money may rise up to $737 billion in 10 years. Democrats have estimated that the act will reduce the government deficit by more than $300 billion.

The act has provisions of $390 billion to combat climate change. Per the Biden administration, the most important way to restore a clean climate is to encourage Americans to shift toward electric vehicles. Democrats are of the opinion that the legislation will reduce carbon emissions 40% by 2030.

On Aug 10, 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act that will provide $52.7 billion to microprocessor developers for five years. The Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 37% share in global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which drastically dropped to just 12% in 2021.

Consequently, U.S. businesses, especially the auto and high-tech industries are suffering from an acute shortage of chipsets owing to the breakdown of the global supply-chain during the pandemic.

On Nov 15, 2021,  President Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure act of $550 billion in addition to the previously approved funds of $450 billion for five years. The law aims at establishing the United States with the world's best economic infrastructure. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years.

Story continues

The infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak. The project will provide $11 billion toward reducing car crashes and fatalities through a “Safe Streets for All” program. The law allocates $39 billion for modernizing public transit and improving access for disabled people.

In addition, the law has proposed $66 billion for passenger and freight rail, $15 billion for electric vehicles and buses, and $17 billion for airports, ports and waterways. The project will invest $50 billion in water infrastructure and $55 billion in clean water projects. Moreover, $65 billion will be invested in high-speed Internet (broadband), $21 billion in environmental clean-up and $73 billion in power infrastructure.

477,Brief Recession or Complete Economic Collapse? What These Wall Street Veterans Think,"Since the pandemic hit in 2020, conspiracy theorists have had a field day. With seemingly everything in question, it’s been hard to discern real information from fake.

An economic collapse is not a new phenomenon or new fear. However, the current scare feels closer than ever before. While nobody is a fortune teller, experts in the field share what they see coming. Here are some reputable investors and large active traders who have shared their thoughts on the matter.

Elon Musk has aired his candid views. Musk stated at the Qatar Economic Forum in late June that “a recession is inevitable at some point, as to whether there is a recession in the near term, that is more likely than not.”

More recently Musk doubled down and said “we are past peak inflation” and likely to see a “relatively mild recession,” lasting for about 18 months. Musk’s take on the global economy was shared during Tesla Inc.’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) shareholders call. Musk admitted however, “making macroeconomic prognostications is a recipe for disaster.”

Jim Cramer has also voiced his opinion on what the economy may look like in the near future. Cramer stated on a July 22 episode of Mad Money that a mild recession was likely. He said “if you talk to Bank of America, Citi, or if you talk to JP Morgan, they will tell you that the consumer is in great shape. When you consider the strong job market and all the money people saved during the pandemic, it’s possible that the consumer can ride out a wave of disappointment.”

BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK) CEO Larry Fink didn’t outright say “economic doom, but he did suggest that “Americans should be more concerned with food prices than oil prices.” Fink’s thoughts were shared in an interview with the Financial Times in July. He explained that “this isn’t just an inflation concern. There are also geopolitical concerns that result.”

Fink’s concerns largely stem from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions and destruction. Oil, gasoline, fertilizer and agricultural products were all hit hard after Russia had sanctions imposed, which contributed to food inflation.

Story continues

Bill Gates billionaire, co-founder of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), has not said much about his personal outlook on the global economy. However, actions speak louder than words, and it seems he agrees with Fink’s take. It is probably common knowledge that Bill Gates is the largest owner of U.S. farmland in the world. He shared Fink’s sentiments in a quote as well, commenting on the Ukraine/Russian war, stating it was “driving up food prices, which will increase malnutrition and instability in low-income countries.”

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and you can comb through numerous quotes from savvy investors, moguls and billionaires. One shared sentiment is that during an economic crisis, there is an opportunity for gains. If you’re smart, patient and a little lucky, you could come out the other end far wealthier than you entered. Here are some of the typical things people invest in during an economic downturn.

Land: If mortgage rates scare you, you like real estate investment trusts (REITs) and you believe there will be a scarcity in food, you may want to explore Farmland Partners, Inc. (NYSE: FPI). The REIT focuses on farmland and land with agricultural development potential. Its portfolio focuses on corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and cotton. Remaining land concentrates on specialty crops like almonds, citrus, blueberries and vegetables. The REIT is up over $3 per share over the past year.

Metals: You may have heard people saying “buy gold.” This precious metal can be turned into cash in most countries, unlike the fluctuating values of other investments like stocks or bonds. The price per ounce may have peaked in 1979, but it is approaching that high again. And had you bought in 2001, you could have cashed in nearly $2,000 per ounce recently.

484,Musk's 'joke' ManU tweet unlikely to land him regulator's red card -legal experts,"By Katanga Johnson and Michelle Price

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While the U.S. securities regulator is likely to examine Elon Musk's tweet in which he joked about buying New York-listed soccer club Manchester United, legal experts say that on its face the crack is unlikely to land him in hot water.

Musk, the world's richest person, briefly lifted the gloom over the club's shares by tweeting on Tuesday: ""I'm buying Manchester United ur (sic) welcome,"" to his 103 million followers, adding later that it was a ""joke.""

Even so, the 51-year-old Tesla CEO's musings ignited Manchester United shares, which briefly jumped as much as 17% in after hours trading before ending Wednesday at $13.67, up nearly 7% on Tuesday's close.

Known for his unconventional and irreverent style, Musk has a history of moving stocks and cryptocurrencies with his tweets and has been locked in a feud with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since tweeting in 2018 that he had funding secured to take Tesla private when the SEC concluded he did not.

According to court and regulatory filings, the SEC has several open investigations into Musk's subsequent tweets about Tesla and has queried others about his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter itself, which he is now embroiled in a legal fight to exit.

Joke or otherwise, the tweets are likely to draw scrutiny from the SEC, given the share price move and Musk's history of skirting U.S. securities rules, legal experts said.

""This may have been a joke to some, but it will not be to the regulators,"" said Jacob Frenkel, a Washington-based attorney at Dickinson Wright and a former SEC official. ""Regulators will want to know what motivated the tweets,"" said Frenkel, adding they would likely take a hard look at trading around the tweet.

Regulators would be interested if there was evidence Musk purposely or recklessly tried to manipulate the market, said Hui Chen, a compliance consultant and former Justice Department lawyer.

Story continues

The SEC declined to comment. Attorneys for Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

HIGH BAR

Still, the bar for pursuing an enforcement action is high, said several other attorneys.

Since Musk is not a Manchester United executive he does not have the same legal obligations to its shareholders as he does to those of Tesla, and there is no indication that he or anyone close to him has a major financial interest in the soccer club.

And while Musk's comments on Tesla are subject to special legal checks under a deal he struck with the SEC to resolve its allegations that his 2018 ""funding secured"" tweet broke the agency's rules, U.S. free speech protections afford Musk plenty of leeway to comment on issues beyond his electric carmaker.

In addition, his clarification that the tweet on Manchester United was a joke addresses the question of his intentions.

All told, it is unlikely that the SEC would be able to demonstrate that he was trying to commit securities fraud, based on the available information, said several attorneys.

""At least on the facts we know, I suspect it will be difficult to prove that Musk ... acted with intent to deceive,"" said Robert Frenchman, a partner at Mukasey Frenchman LLP.

Others said that Musk's track record of whimsical twitter commentary - which has ranged from an April Fool's Day quip about Tesla going bankrupt to aliens and the zombie apocalypse - could also be cited in his defense, were regulators or other parties to take issue with the tweet.

It is arguable that investors now know to treat Musk's tweets with caution, said Howard Fischer, a partner at Moses & Singer in New York.

""While Musk is already under investigation for his conduct relating to Tesla and Twitter, it appears unlikely that this will make it a hat trick,"" he added.

487,UPDATE 1-Tesla cuts delivery waiting time for Model Y in China to a minimum of 4 weeks,"(Adds details, context)

SHANGHAI, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Electric auto giant Tesla said on Thursday it has slashed the delivery waiting time for its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China as it ramps up output at its Shanghai plant after upgrading production lines.

The waiting time for the rear-wheel drive Model Y sport utility vehicle is now four to eight weeks, while buyers of other versions of the SUV and Model 3 sedans need to wait for 12 to 20 weeks. Tesla previously said a buyer in China had to wait for eight to 24 weeks after placing an order for the best-selling models.

Tesla confirmed the shortened waiting time, first disclosed on the company's Chinese website, citing the output ramp-up at its Shanghai plant as one of the reasons.

The automaker usually delivers more of its cars produced in Shanghai to Chinese customers in the latter half of each quarter, which also brings an acceleration in deliveries, the company said.

Tesla has completed a major upgrade of the production lines at its Shanghai plant, its most productive manufacturing hub, and is ramping up output with a target of making 22,000 Model 3 and Model Y cars combined each week.

Chief Executive Elon Musk has said production is a bigger challenge for the company than demand. It is struggling to increase output in its Berlin and Texas plants, while production losses during a two-month COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai hurt Tesla's profit margin in the second quarter.

The company has stopped taking orders for its Cybertruck outside North America, and also for Model 3 Long Range vehicles in the United States and Canada, citing big delivery backlogs.

489,7 Speculative Stocks to Buy If You Believe the Rumors,"Nothing drives interest the way speculative stocks seem to.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. That’s a long held adage and trading strategy on Wall Street and speaks to the fact that speculation abounds when it comes to speculative stocks.

Often times, whispers that a company is about to be acquired or split its stock are enough to send share prices soaring. Those same stocks can come crashing back to earth once official news reports clarify the situation, often debunking the rumors that had led a particular stock to rally.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Such is the nature of investing. And with internet chat rooms full of people speculating and spreading rumors about stocks around the clock, it can be increasingly difficult for retail investors to separate fact from fiction.

Currently there are several rumors circulating that, if true, could lead to big gains in certain securities. In this article, we look at seven speculative stocks to buy if you believe the rumors related to them.

ATVI Activision Blizzard $80.46 TWTR Twitter $44.28 ROKU Roku $78.61 CMG Chipotle Mexican Grill $1703.23 HOOD Robinhood Markets $10.44 CVX Chevron $157.87 BABA Alibaba $90.63

Rumor has it that Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) $68.7 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) will be approved by antitrust regulators around the world and conclude next year.

If that rumor proves true, Microsoft will end up paying $95 a share for Activision Blizzard in an all-cash deal. That $95 a share would represent a a nearly 20% premium over the current share price of $80.

Investors who are willing to take a calculated risk, could buy ATVI stock now and sell their stake in the company for a 20% profit when the acquisition by Microsoft concludes in 2023.

Buying speculative stocks in hopes of tendering the shares for a profit in a successful takeover is known as arbitrage play. And at least one high-profile investor is doing exactly that with ATVI stock.

Story continues

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) has been accumulating shares of Activision Blizzard, betting that they will be able to tender them for a profit once Microsoft’s acquisition of the video game company is given the green light by regulators.

Buffett added to his Activision Blizzard stake as recently as this year’s second quarter and now owns more than 74 million shares of the company worth in excess of $6 billion.

The rumor is that Elon Musk is going to be forced by a court to buy social media giant Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) for the original price he agreed to of $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

Should Musk be forced by a court in Delaware to honor the agreement he signed this past spring to purchase Twitter, then the acquisition price will represent a 21% premium to Twitter’s current price of $44.80 a share.

Of course, Musk, who is also chief executive of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), has tried everything under the sun to get out of the deal to buy Twitter. But with the case heading to court this October, there is a very real possibility that he could be forced to buy the company.

Investors willing to bet on the rule of law, could purchase TWTR stock now in hopes of tendering their shares and making a tidy profit once the Twitter acquisition is completed, in much the same way they would with shares of Activision Blizzard.

Of course, the situation with Twitter is much more acrimonious and anything could happen once the legal case begins. However, analysts who have been following the saga seem to feel that the judge in the case will render a verdict quickly.

The rumor is they are likely to side with Twitter and force Musk to buy the social media company. Should this be the case, a quick profit could be made by shareholders of TWTR stock.

Roku (ROKU) Here's How the Roku Stock Retreat Has Created a Good Buying Opportunity

Source: Shutterstock

Embattled company Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), which makes internet-connected television sets and runs an online advertising business, is a takeover target. Or so the rumor goes.

There was a rumor that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which spun-off Roku in 2009, was looking to reacquire the business to help it launch its new ad-supported streaming tier.

That rumor turned out to be false as Netflix ended up partnering with Microsoft for its new advertising venture. Yet rumors that Roku, whose share price has fallen 76% in the past 12-months, will be acquired just won’t go away.

Who else could acquire Roku? And would an acquisition be the best thing for Roku at this point? There have been media reports that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could potentially buy Roku, whose market capitalization currently stands at $11 billion.

While a concrete acquisition has not yet emerged, rumors of a takeover persist. With ROKU stock down 64% since the start of the year a sale might be what’s needed to boost the flagging share price.

Chipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle

While takeovers are usually great catalysts to push a stock higher, so too are stock splits.

Stock splits are all the rage this year with companies such as Amazon, Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) each undertaking them in recent months.

Among the companies that continues to be mentioned when it comes to discussions about stock splits is Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).

The popular quick-service restaurant chain that specializes in Mexican cuisine has been a publicly traded company since 2006 but has never split its stock which makes it fit nicely among these prime speculative stocks.

Consequently, CMG stock currently trades at $1,700 per share. That’s quite pricey for most retail investors and puts the stock out of reach for many people.

As such, analysts who cover the company (and hopeful investors) say the time is right for Chipotle to finally relent and split its stock, bringing the price per share down and sparking a buying frenzy among investors and traders.

But whether Chipotle will actually split its stock remains unknown. To date, the company has said very little on the subject. But it’s fun to speculate.

Robinhood (HOOD) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Robinhood (HOOD).

There was a rumor a few weeks back that online trading platform Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) was going to be acquired by privately held FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange run by MIT graduate Sam Bankman-Fried.

While many analysts saw the potential marriage of Robinhood and cryptocurrency as a match made in hell, the rumor turned out to be false, with Bankman-Fried saying there are no active talks underway between the two companies.

Yet, Robinhood is among these speculative stocks to buy because people believe the company needs to be acquired.

Fueling the speculation is the notion that now that the pandemic-fueled trading frenzy has cooled and HOOD stock has cratered 77% since last summer to trade at $11 a share.

HOOD stock is now trading nearly 80% below its 52-week high of $55.01 per share. The company has released dreadful earnings this year and recently announced that it is cutting nearly a quarter (23%) of its workforce after missing on both the top and bottom lines with its Q2 results.

So, where does the company go now?

At its current valuation, and with a market cap of $9 billion, many analysts on Wall Street say that Robinhood remains a likely takeover target. Analysts at Citigroup (NYSE:C) recently issued a note to clients saying that HOOD stock could be worth $15 a share in a takeover, which would represent a premium of 36%.

Chevron (CVX) CVX stock

This next rumor is, admittedly, an ugly one. But investors who believe the rumor that Russia is likely to cut off oil and natural gas supplies to western European nations this coming winter.

If that happens it will send energy prices sky high in the process making Chevron (NYSE:CVX) one of the speculative stocks to watch.

We already got a glimpse of what this situation might look like when Russian temporarily shutoff a pipeline delivering natural gas to Europe for maintenance repairs in July, raising political alarm bells and causing oil and natural gas prices to spike.

Germany, France and other countries are racing to stockpile oil and gas before the cold weather arrives, but indications are that the stockpiles will be insufficient and run out before spring.

There is also no way to know exactly what Russia will do once the snow flies, but new all-time highs for prices of crude oil and natural gas are likely.

That would be a boon for energy giants such as Chevron, which just reported record second quarter revenues on the back on elevated oil prices.

Chinese technology giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) would be a great stock to buy for investors who believe the rumor that authorities in Beijing are done beating up on large, publicly traded domestic companies.

Over the past two years, Alibaba has been hit with a record antitrust fine of $2.8 billion and seen its stock collapse 70% to now trade at under $100 a share. The situation got so bad that Alibaba founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Jack Ma went into hiding for a period of time.

But indications are that Chinese authorities are easing up on their crackdown of Alibaba and other technology concerns.

Official comments from government authorities in recent weeks hint at a loosening of restrictions and punishments imposed on publicly traded companies.

If true, now would be an excellent time for investors to scoop up shares of BABA stock on the cheap. Alibaba’s share price hasn’t been this low since late 2016 and is hovering right around the company’s 2014 IPO price.

Of course, the situation in China remains unpredictable at the best of times, but investors with an appetite for risk might want to roll the dice on Alibaba stock, betting that the worst is over.

490,Tesla Asks Chinese Government to Help Secure Power to Suppliers,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. and SAIC Motor Corp. told Shanghai’s government they may have difficulty maintaining production if a power crunch in Sichuan continues to impact suppliers, according to people familiar with the matter, prompting city officials to ask the southwestern province if it could prioritize electricity for the carmakers’ suppliers.

The two companies informed authorities in Shanghai that key parts of their supply chains may be impacted by power cuts in Sichuan, which is seeing its worst drought on record. The Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Information then reached out to the government in Sichuan in a document that subsequently circulated on Chinese social media.

According to the document, the Shanghai government asked that electricity supply to 16 auto-parts suppliers based in Sichuan -- including Chengdu Yinli Car Parts, the only company named in the document -- be extended.

Tesla is coordinating with the Shanghai and Sichuan governments to ensure its suppliers in Sichuan have ample power, the people familiar said, adding that the carmakers hadn’t seen any production delays as yet.

A representative for Tesla in China declined to comment. A spokesperson from SAIC, one of China’s largest state-owned automakers, said via WeChat that the company is “actively coordinating with the local government of Sichuan” and working to reduce any impact from the power crunch.

Xi Highlights Drought Risk in China as Power Supplies Threatened

The idea Tesla and SAIC suppliers may be prioritized for power as people suffer in what is intense heat sparked a backlash on Chinese social media with people calling the Shanghai government and its entities selfish and arrogant.

“The lives of people in Sichuan seem less important than Tesla,” one post read.

Another said: “It is just too much. We are in desperate need of electricity. Thirteen people were hospitalized yesterday out of heat stroke.”

Sichuan is one of China’s most populous provinces. It is highly reliant on hydropower, making it particularly vulnerable to a heat wave and drought that’s pushing up air-conditioning demand and drying up reservoirs behind hydro dams.

Toyota Motor Corp. and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s top battery maker, earlier closed plants in Sichuan, with the Japanese automaker shutting a factory in the provincial capital of Chengdu and CATL halting activity at its major lithium battery base in Yibin. Both suspensions are expected to last through Aug. 20.

491,5 Companies Most at Risk of Biden’s Stock Buyback Tax,"Is the upcoming stock buyback tax bad news or no big deal? That’s what investors are asking now, following President Biden’s signing of the Inflation Reduction Act into law on Aug 16.

For some industries, this $437 billion spending package could potentially result in a windfall.

Shares in EV makers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), as well as other “green wave” companies like green hydrogen company Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), have moved higher since Congress passed the bill earlier this month.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

For others, however, this bill really isn’t cause for celebration.  This legislation also calls for increased corporate taxes, including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations, plus a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks.

A 1% stock buyback tax may seem like nothing to worry about.

Still, this bill stands to be a negative for companies using shares repurchases as a means to maximize investor returns. For example, with these stocks. In the case of each one, a stock buyback tax could put a drag on future returns.

AAPL Apple $174.55 MSFT Microsoft $291.32 NKE Nike $117.04 WFC Wells Fargo $46.14 XOM ExxonMobil $92.20

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands to be one of the largest payers of this excise tax.

The tech giant currently has a $90 billion share repurchase plan in place. If the tax were to be applied to the total value of this repurchase plan, it would amount to a $900 million tax bill.

The stock buyback tax could dent future returns for AAPL stock investors. How? Without the tax, Apple’s buyback could help to boost its earnings per share (or EPS) by 3.5%. With the tax bill, and its impact on earnings, the EPS boost would amount to just 2.5%.

Again, the difference may sound like small potatoes. Yet with the company trying to sustain its valuation (28.4x earnings), as its organic growth slows, and rising interest rates put pressure on valuations, it may have a meaningful impact on anyone looking to invest in Apple today.

Like Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech giant using big buybacks to give a boost to its EPS.

A year ago, it initiated a $60 billion repurchase program. With its share repurchase programs typically spanning several years, much of this amount will be subject to the excise tax, as it affects any buybacks that happen after Jan 1, 2023.

The downside here for MSFT stock investors is that, again like Apple, aggressive repurchases could be a slight negative for earnings growth, making it tough to maintain its own similarly-high earnings multiple (28.7x).

To avoid the tax, Microsoft could opt to, instead of buying back stock, raise its dividend. Even then, however, it would completely lose the positive benefit buybacks have on EPS.

With interest rates rising, it’s questionable whether significantly raising its forward yield (currently 0.85%) would do much to sustain/grow its stock price.

Back in June, Nike (NYSE:NKE) announced the start of a new share repurchase program. It plans to buy back $18 billion worth of stock over the next four fiscal years. In other words, much of this amount will be subject to the stock buyback tax.

Yes, the financial impact doesn’t seem that high, compared to earnings. It comes out to a cost of $45 million per year, or just under 3 cents per share. EPS for NKE stock this fiscal year (ending May 2024) is expected to come in at $3.77, implying an impact of less than 1%.

However, this could still be a negative. Trading for an even higher forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.3x, it’s already in a precarious position in today’s rising rate environment.

Any further dent to earnings growth could send shares, already down 28.3% this year, lower.

Lately, bank stocks have been suspending buybacks. Mainly, because major money center banks have had to shore up their capital reserves, after the latest regulatory stress tests. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), though, seems to be an exception.

Last month, CFO Mike Santomassimo informed investors that the repurchase of WFC stock would continue.

Still under an asset cap imposed in 2018 due to past scandals, it made sense for the bank to return excess cash to shareholders. According to a Seeking Alpha commentator, it has bought nearly $20 billion worth of shares in the past year.

But the stock buyback tax, atop the prospect of more challenging economic times, may compel it to reduce future repurchases.

With loan growth limited by the asset cap, its only option for excess cash will be to raise its dividend. With interest rates moving up, the impact of this could at best be a wash.

ExxonMobil (XOM) XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some Time

Reporting high earnings due to energy prices, big oil has been announcing big stock buybacks. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is no exception. It plans to complete $30 billion in buybacks by the end of 2023.

In other words, possibly on the hook for hundreds of million in stock buyback tax. Of course, the company could decide to accelerate the repurchase of XOM stock, before the Dec 31 deadline.

Already trading at a low valuation (7.2x), a less than 1% drop in earnings due to the tax (if it had to pay it) likely wouldn’t add any more pressure to shares.

So, what’s the big risk here? The success of this bill could pave the way for further increased taxation of big oil.

While repeated efforts to tax “windfall profits” have gone nowhere, that’s not to say new proposals (or aspects of these proposals) will fail to gain traction.

493,3 Long-Term EV Plays to Reap Benefits From the Climate Bill,"U.S. President Biden has signed the sweeping climate change bill into law. The bill — also called the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — is the boldest climate legislation in U.S. history. The landmark bill seeks to allot around $370 billion toward clean energy initiatives to turbocharge decarbonization efforts, which would put the United States on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 40% below 2005 levels by the decade-end.

The electric vehicle (EV) space is likely to emerge as one of the beneficiaries of the new climate bill.  As it is, amid heightening climate concerns and technological advancement, more and more cars are getting electrified as legacy automakers are fast shifting gears to e-mobility. And now this IRA is set to further supercharge the prospects of the EV industry.

To capitalize on the e-mobility future, consider adding to your watchlist the EV king Tesla TSLA as well as two auto giants that are rapidly revving up their electrification game— General Motors GM and Ford F. Before discussing these stocks, let’s take a look at the key takeaways of the climate bill for the automakers.

IRA to Unlock EV Discounts Albeit With Caveats

The bill seeks to transform the U.S. auto industry with incentives that would induce automakers to accelerate the production of zero-emission vehicles in an effort to meet environmental goals.

To encourage the adoption of EVs, the IRA includes a $7,500 tax credit till 2032 on the purchase of a new EV. Importantly, the tax credit will be sans the 200,000-car cap. In the current scenario, the tax credit phases out once a company has reached the 200,000 EV sales mark. A few auto biggies, including Tesla, General Motors and Toyota, have already exhausted the limit. The updated EV tax credit would remove that cap at the start of 2023.Beginning next year, the vehicles of these auto giants will again become eligible for a tax credit as long as they are manufactured in North America and meet the raw material sourcing requirements.

Story continues

This brings us to one of the major concerns that automakers are set to face. The new bill has provisions for tax credits only for vehicles that are assembled in North America. In other words, the law immediately disqualifies any EV produced outside North America to take advantage of the incentives. Going by that, around 70% of the 72 models currently eligible for the $7,500 tax credits will no longer get the benefits, per the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. Notably, some of the mass market brands, including the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and Toyota Rav4 Prime are no more eligible for the tax credit as they are not domestically manufactured.

And things would get tougher with the raw material sourcing criterion that comes into effect in 2023. Notably, the raw materials for the vehicle batteries should be procured only from countries with which the United States has free-trade agreements, starting from 2023. While the bill surely seeks to promote domestic battery manufacturing, many EVs will get disqualified for the credit benefit right off the bat.

There’s also a new $4,000 credit on used EVs, which are priced at $25,000 or less. But to be eligible for the tax credit for a used vehicle, the gross annual income of a family should not exceed $150,000 (for joint tax filers) or $75,000 (for individual tax filers).

For the new vehicles to qualify for tax credits, the sticker price for sedans should be below $55,000. Meanwhile, SUVs, trucks and vans, should not be costing more than $80,000.To qualify for the new EV credit, buyers’ taxable income will be capped at $150,000 if they are single filers or $300,000 for joint filers.

While on the surface, the IRA looks like a sure-fire legislation to fast-track the EV industry, things are not that hunky dory. With the new legislation, it may get difficult for many cars to qualify for the credit right, considering the sticker price and income caps. And most importantly the fact that the law requires the cars and batteries to be “made in America” remains a major limitation.

So, the new legislation may not be much beneficial for automakers, which don’t manufacture a large number of EVs in the United States or certain EV upstarts whose vehicles are too expensive to qualify for credit. Meanwhile, companies like Tesla, General Motors and Ford stand to benefit from the new climate bill as they have reorganized their supply chains to manufacture vehicles in America.

3 Stocks in Focus

Tesla: With the sales threshold removal under the new bill, Tesla will regain eligibility for incentives beginning 2023 for its entry-level, Model 3 RWD variant, which is priced under $55,000. With both variants of Model Y classified as SUVs and meeting the price caps, they would also qualify for tax credits. Industry watchdogs believe that Tesla is the closest in terms of fulfilling the raw material sourcing requirements from the United States or trading allies, as mandated by the new law.

This EV behemoth currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The robust demand for Models 3 and Y is buoying Tesla's revenues. High volumes are also aiding Tesla in achieving production efficiencies, thereby strengthening gross margins. The company’s long-term expected EPS growth rate is 31.2%.

General Motors: While GM has also exhausted its quota of 200,000 electric cars, it will again qualify from next year now with the new climate bill. The company has numerous affordable EV brands that will be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. These include Cadillac Lyriq, Chevy Bolt EV, Chevy Bolt EUV, Chevy Silverado EV, Chevy Blazer EV, Chevy Equinox EV and GMC Sierra EV. Silverado and Sierra EVs will only be eligible for lower trim levels considering the price cap.

General Motors, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), intends to roll out 30 EV models by 2025-end. GM’s Factory ZERO and plants in Spring Hill and CAMI are setting the stage for the company’s electrification goals. GM’s Ultium Drive system is scaling up its e-mobility prowess. The company’s long-term expected EPS growth rate is 10%.

Ford: In May, Ford’s CEO Farley notified that he expected the Ford EV tax credits to dry up by late 2022 or early 2023. But with the elimination of the quota of 200,000 cars, Ford’s popular EV models stand to take advantage of the discounts under the bill. Both Mustang Mach E and F-150 Lightning are eligible for the tax credit, considering their manufacturing status and sticker price. All trim levels of Mustang Mach E— manufactured in Mexico with prices well below the $80,000 threshold for SUVs —qualify. Built in Michigan, all Standard Range models of the F-Lightning e truck that will fall below the $80,000 threshold qualify for the tax credit.

Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The firm’s aggressive EV push, with planned spending of around $50 billion by 2026 and the target production of over 2 million EVs by 2026-end (representing 70% CAGR), augurs well for long-term growth. By 2030, Ford expects EVs to account for 50% of its global sales, which will cement its position in the red-hot EV landscape. The company’s long-term expected EPS growth rate is 9.1%.

495,Tesla (TSLA) to Bring Supercharger Network to US Non-Tesla Owners,"After many months of planning, the global EV magnate Tesla Inc. TSLA has announced that it will be offering its Supercharger network throughout the United States to non-Tesla EV owners. The novel move will provide a wide range of places for car owners to plug in.

The Supercharger network is the company’s extensive global network of fast-charging stations.. The network functions through a pay-per-use plan as well as a membership-based plan with fees at rates of per kWh. A separate membership is needed for each Tesla account, with each member being limited to a maximum of five Supercharger charge sessions per day.

The company had already carried out a number of overseas pilot programs to execute its plan in North America. In November last year, the company initiated a pilot program functioning at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands to open its doors to non-Tesla owners who could charge using the Tesla app. In January 2022, it widened the program's reach to Norway and France and has gradually been working to cover a large chunk of Europe under the ambit of the framework.

The announcement is thus one of the most awaited ones for EV owners in the country. However, introducing the program to North America had its challenges since Tesla uses its proprietary plug in the country instead of the usual CCS plug. But as Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk had stated, the company has made available an adapter to facilitate the standard CCS plug in the US.

Undoubtedly the global EV space is witnessing great strides and is posed to be a burgeoning domain in coming times. However, a lack of adequate charging networks seriously ails the EV world and hinders widespread adoption.

TSLA operates the largest charging network in the country and providing access to non-Tesla customers is likely to encourage more Americans to transition to battery power. It will commence production of the new Supercharger equipment in North America later this year.

The Biden administration in the country is all up for an intensive electrification drive and has announced several plans to bolster electrification. It has laid out plans to build a network of 500,000 public charger ports by 2030. In May, it kick-started a $3 billion investment plan to enhance battery production for EVs. Tesla’s Supercharger network in North America underscores the government’s vision and makes way for the company to leverage part of the $5 billion investment pool set up by the administration for EV infrastructure. It is also natural that the plan will generate additional revenues for the EV giant and enable it to add more to its already large market footprint.

But there seems to remain a hitch that the network could throw up some issues. There have been complaints from Tesla owners about the growing traffic at Supercharger stations that often keeps owners in long queues. Therefore the addition of more EVs is brewing fresh concerns in this aspect. Time will tell if Tesla can expedite the manufacture of chargers and look for a solution in its best possible capacity.

Nonetheless, the execution will be a noteworthy development in the country, sure to catapult the company’s success.

Shares of TSLA have surged 35.4% over the past year outperforming its industry’s 14.3% rise.

496,Elon Musk’s GOP ties deepen as he appears at a Trump-aligned donor event,"With his attempt to un-buy Twitter not going to trial until October, Elon Musk has spent the interlude wading even further into politics and the Republican camp by appearing at a GOP donor retreat this week in Wyoming hosted by House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).

The Tesla (TSLA) CEO reportedly participated in a “fireside chat” with McCarthy on Tuesday night before the Trump-aligned audience. The gathering was notable for taking place the same day and in the same state that Republican primary voters ended Liz Cheney’s tenure in Congress over her criticisms of Donald Trump.

But at the same time, in a tweet that was apparently sent from the Republican event, Musk also again claimed to be a moderate without allegiance to either political party.

To be clear, I support the left half of the Republican Party and the right half of the Democratic Party!

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 16, 2022

While Musk has a long history of supporting both political parties — allying himself over the years with a dizzying array of figures from George W. Bush to Barack Obama to Margaret Thatcher to Kanye West — nearly all recent public evidence points toward him becoming more and more of a Republican.

‘This election I will’ vote Republican

Musk said directly in May that “this election I will” vote Republican largely because he says Democrats are “overly controlled by the unions and by the trial lawyers,” during an interview where he also criticized Republicans. Musk also went after Joe Biden, saying the current president is more beholden to the left-wing forces in his party compared to Barack Obama, whom Musk supported in the past.

Likewise, Musk has donated exclusively to Republicans since 2021 according to the Federal Election Commission records. His recently giving (which is very modest) is in contrast to his donations in 2020 which were tilted toward Republicans but with a few Democratic names sprinkled in.

Story continues

Musk’s Twitter feed in recent weeks has also featured political messages firmly in line with the GOP.

Fate 🖤 Irony pic.twitter.com/RHZ9BEws7k

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 11, 2022

He recently posted a meme that echoed misleading claims that the Inflation Reduction Act will lead to 87,000 new IRS agents. Fact checkers have repeatedly pushed back against that GOP talking point, noting that the bill doesn't specify that 87,000 new IRS agents are coming. In fact, much of the $80 billion in the bill set aside for the IRS is set to go toward replacing retiring staff and upgrades to catch tax cheats.

Representatives of Musk didn't respond to requests from Yahoo Finance for evidence to back up the CEO's claims of bipartisanship. He also reportedly didn't declare himself a Republican or pledge new money at this week's GOP event, while also saying that the party needs to be more open and compassionate to immigrants like himself.

Musk & Trump

Musk meanwhile has had a rocky relationship in recent months with the current leader of the GOP, Donald Trump. Musk asked the former president to “hang up his hat & sail into the sunset” after Trump called him “another bullsh*t artist” during a back and forth over his possible purchase of Twitter.

But Musk's ongoing fight with Twitter (TWTR) has also put Musk in good stead with many Trump allies, because of his criticisms of the social media company's free speech policies and his suggestion that he might let Trump reinstate his account if the deal goes through.

And Musk was apparently a hit before with the audience of Trump loyalists in Wyoming.

“Bucket list #selfie” wrote Morgan Ortagus in a tweet and photo apparently taken at the event. Ortagus was a spokesperson for the State Department during the Trump administration and received an endorsement from Trump earlier this year for an ultimately short-lived run for Congress.

Bucket list #selfie Thank you @elonmusk ❤️ pic.twitter.com/MBAC8PV2PC

— Morgan Ortagus (@MorganOrtagus) August 17, 2022

Another picture circulating online came from the account of Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX), who welcomed Trump’s endorsement in 2020.

Going forward, Musk has mused about creating a “Super Moderate Super PAC” but has taken no public steps to do so. Notably, he floated that idea on the same Twitter thread where he also said he was leaning toward a candidate in 2024 who is not considered by many to be a super moderate: Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL).

501,LVS Advisory: “We’re Watching Musk’s Deal to Acquire Twitter (TWTR)”,"Investment management company LVS Advisory, a New York City-based full-service investment firm, recently released its second quarter, 2022 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The defensive portfolio of the fund declined 1% and its Growth Portfolio declined 36.2% in the first half of the year. Investments in industries that were hit hard and in international stocks impacted the fund's performance. Moreover, the portfolio's bias towards small and medium cap stocks and concentration of its Growth Portfolio in 10 to 20 stocks contributed to the underperformance of the fund. For more information on the fund’s top picks in 2022, please check its top five holdings.

LVS Advisory mentioned Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) in the letter and discussed its views about the company. Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) is a San Francisco, California-based communication company. The stock of Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) closed at $43.99 per share on August 17, 2022. One-month return of Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) was 11.09%, while its shares lost 29.19% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) has a market capitalization of  $33.663 billion.

Here's what LVS Advisory specifically said about Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR)  in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“A good example of a situation we avoided was Elon Musk’s deal to acquire Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR). In this case, the merger agreement is contractually very strong. However, Elon Musk is an impulsive and unpredictable buyer. In 2018, he offered to acquire Tesla and backed away from the offer a few months later. Furthermore, the $44 billion acquisition was originally to be financed by taking out a sizable margin loan on his Tesla stake that could be impacted by a decline in Tesla’s stock. Finally, it quickly became clear that Musk struck a bad deal when the technology market crashed in the weeks following his Twitter deal signing.

We were not surprised when Musk attempted to terminate his deal with Twitter just a few months after agreeing to it. Because the deal is legally binding, Twitter is taking Musk to court. Merger agreements are rarely tested in court, so we are watching this situation intently from the sidelines to see how it will play out.

Instead of betting on impulsive deals with questionable motives, we prefer betting on deals that are clear win-wins for the buyers and sellers. For example, a situation where the buyer is willing to pay a healthy price to lock in the strategic benefits & synergies of a deal and the seller’s shareholders are exiting from a position of strength...""

507,U.S. seeks information from Tesla on in-car camera in Autopilot probe,"By David Shepardson and Hyunjoo Jin

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. auto safety regulators on Thursday asked Tesla Inc to answer questions about its in-car camera intended to monitor driver awareness as part of a probe into 830,000 Tesla vehicles that employ the carmaker's advanced driver assistance system called Autopilot.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is assessing the performance of Autopilot after earlier identifying a dozen crashes in which Tesla vehicles struck stopped emergency vehicles.

In June, it upgraded its probe to an engineering analysis - a required step before it could potentially demand a recall.

NHTSA's nine-page letter demands Tesla answer questions by Oct. 12 about ""the role that the Cabin Camera plays in the enforcement of driver engagement/attentiveness.""

According to Tesla, the cabin camera - a camera located above the rear view mirror - can determine driver inattentiveness and provide audible alerts to remind the driver to keep their eyes on the road when Autopilot is engaged.

NHTSA said it was seeking information on the cabin camera's ""impact on driver engagement alert types and timing"" as well as ""recoverable data elements pointing to its influence.""

The agency said it wanted an explanation for ""design decisions"" on driver engagement enforcement, ""including the evidence that justifies the period of time that the driver is permitted to have their hands off the steering wheel before receiving a warning.""

The regulator is reviewing whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention. The agency said in June evidence suggested drivers in most crashes under review had complied with Tesla's alert strategy, raising questions about its effectiveness.

Tesla, which has disbanded its press office, did not respond to a request for comment.

Consumer Reports said when it evaluated Tesla's driver attention monitoring camera in late 2021 ""we found that it wasn't adequate to ensure that the driver was fully paying attention when the driver was using Autopilot and Full Self Driving (FSD) features.""

Story continues

The magazine said it ""could block the in-cabin camera, and the car wouldn't issue a warning, slow down the car, or shut off the systems.""

In June, Consumer Reports said the company had installed an over-the-air update that issued a warning when the camera is covered while FSD is engaged, but not with Autopilot.

Autopilot is intended to enable cars to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within their lane, while FSD enables vehicles to obey traffic signals and make lane changes.

In addition to the defect probe, NHTSA has opened 38 special investigations since 2016 of crashes involving Tesla vehicles and where Autopilot or other advanced systems were suspected of being used. A total of 19 deaths have been reported in those Tesla-related investigations.

Separately, California's state transportation has accused Tesla of falsely advertising the features as providing autonomous vehicle control.

Tesla said in notices filed with the state that were released Thursday that it is seeking a hearing on the complaints and intends to present a defense.

California's Department of Motor Vehicles is seeking remedies that could include suspending Tesla's license to sell vehicles in the state and requiring the company provide restitution to drivers.

510,Musk Says Twitter Is Hounding Him Over Every Chat About Buyout,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk says Twitter Inc. is casting too wide a net for the names of those he talked to about his proposed $44 billion buyout of the social media company.

The billionaire on Wednesday complained about it to the judge overseeing their legal dispute. After a fusillade of document demands over the acquisition, which Twitter has sued Musk to complete, Twitter is now going after friends, colleagues and firms far outside the case’s scope for information on the deal’s financing, his legal team argued.

In a letter to Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, Musk’s attorneys said they had already handed over the names of “scores of individuals and entities” with “unique information” about the financing. They said Twitter at this point is pushing for documents from anyone “who might have had a passing conversation” with Musk about the buyout.

Both sides are jockeying for position as they prepare for an Oct. 17 trial, sending out a torrent of subpoenas to equity investors, advisers and banks involved in the proposed acquisition. On Thursday, Musk filed notice of subpoenas served on advertising technology firms Integral Ad Science and DoubleVerify. In trying to avoid the buyout, he claims Twitter has understated the number of bot and spam accounts on the platform.

Among the people and firms Twitter has described as “actual or potential” co-investors in the deal are Citadel Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin and Founders Fund Growth II Management, a venture capital fund owned by PayPal co-founder and longtime Musk friend Peter Thiel.

Story continues

At issue in Wednesday’s letter is who qualifies as a potential co-investor in Musk’s $7.1 billion equity raise for the buyout. Musk’s side says Twitter wants to include anyone the Tesla Inc. CEO talked to about the deal in “even the briefest, non-substantive, social interactions.”

A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on the letter.

The case is Twitter v. Musk, 2022-0613, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

“What we want is the electric car, not the battery. For Tesla, we want them to build electric cars in Indonesia,” President Joko Widodo said in an interview with Bloomberg News’ Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait on Thursday. “We want a huge ecosystem of electric cars.”

Jokowi, as the president is known, said that he had similar expectations from Ford Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp., signaling his intent to seek investment and ensure Indonesia was not relegated to being just a raw material supplier or component maker in the global electric-vehicle supply chain.

The Southeast Asian nation, home to almost a quarter of global nickel reserves, has emerged as a powerhouse producer in recent years. That makes it an extremely attractive destination for auto and battery-makers, including Tesla, looking for battery materials.

Indonesia Says Tesla Secures $5 Billion Nickel Supply Deal

“It’s still a discussion,” Jokowi said, when asked what’s holding back a deal with Tesla. “Everything needs time. I don’t want to be quick with no result. It needs intense communication and the result will show.”

An Indonesian official said in May the country was arranging a meeting between the president and Musk to discuss potential investments. A team from the pioneering EV maker also visited several Indonesian sites. Musk said he was considering a visit “hopefully in November” to explore opportunities, according to a statement from Jokowi’s office in May.

Musk Considers Indonesia Trip to Explore Possible Investments

The government has held talks on potential partnerships with Musk’s team over several years, including on the development of EVs with Tesla and on the possibility of a SpaceX rocket launch site in the country -- but no agreements have been reached.

Indonesia is home to some of the world’s largest deposits of copper, nickel and tin. While most of its nickel output has been so far exported as intermediate material for steel plants in China and elsewhere, Jokowi’s government is now keen to reposition the nation as an EV and battery hub.

517,Exxon Mobil and Nvidia have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – August 19, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM as the Bull of the Day and Nvidia NVDA as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tesla TSLA, General Motors GM and Ford F.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

Exxon Mobil Corp. posted a blockbuster second quarter, generating roughly $17 billion in free cash flow. The U.S. oil titan's earnings estimates continue to soar, driven by strong oil prices, streamlined business operations, and beyond.

Exxon's outlook remains impressive even as oil prices cool. Plus, XOM's valuation and dividend payout help make it worth considering as part of a diversified long-term portfolio and during the exuberant stock market rebound.

Exxon's Energy Pitch

Exxon is one of the world's largest publicly traded energy providers and chemical manufacturers, with a diverse portfolio of offerings that help drive modern economies. XOM runs upstream operations, with oil and natural gas exploration and development around the world. The firm is also a leading refiner and marketer of petroleum products. These segments are poised to remain Exxon's lifeblood for the foreseeable future.

Exxon's executive team is, of course, more focused than ever on the future. These efforts include its product solutions segment that aims to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and plastic waste by ""developing more sustainable products such as lower-emission fuels, chemical performance products and next-generation lubricants and plastics.""

Exxon is also actively investing in hydrogen technology, biofuels, and other lower-emission fuels. On top of that, XOM continues to make progress on the carbon capture and storage fronts.

The Oil and Energy Boom

Oil and energy experienced a rough stretch during the 2010s as oil and natural gas production in the U.S. boomed. Part of the energy sector's decline was due to the large increase in supply, driven by the advent of hydraulic fracturing (fracking). At the same time, the push toward renewable energy saw some on Wall Street avoid investing in oil and gas.

Story continues

The so-called lost decade for oil and gas companies forced Exxon and others to reevaluate every aspect of their businesses, slimming down operations to run more efficiently than ever. The cost-cutting measures are now paying off in a huge way amid rebounding oil and energy prices.

Exxon is investing in a lower-carbon future and the green energy boom appears here to stay. Yet, the comeback off the covid lows and the huge boom in 2022 helped cement the critical roles crude and natural gas play in the global economy.

Oil and natural gas will likely continue to be some of the backbones of economies around the world for decades to come. And the Russian invasion of Ukraine highlighted just how important Exxon and other titans are, as supplies struggle to meet growing global demand.

Exxon and others benefited from rising oil and energy prices amid the huge rebound in demand as the U.S. and other economies roared back to life. Travel, including air travel, has already mounted a serious comeback and broader energy demand is attempting to return to pre-Covid levels.

XOM's Growth and Outlook

Exxon is the largest U.S. oil company with a market cap approaching $400 billion. XOM reported strong growth in 2021 and historic strength in first-half of 2022, driven by soaring oil and energy prices that saw crude climb to $120 a barrel at one point.

Exxon posted record quarterly profit in the second quarter, with its adjusted Q2 earnings up 276% to $4.14 per share, driven by record refining margins.

XOM's FY22 and fiscal 2023 consensus earnings estimates extended their march higher following its impressive results on July 29. The company's FY22 EPS estimate is now up 21% over the past 60 days, with FY23 over 13% higher. XOM's bottom-line positivity helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment.

Exxon's FY21 revenue soared 57% to $285.6 billion and it swung from an adjusted loss of -$0.33 per share to +$5.38 a share. Looking ahead, Zacks estimates call for its revenue to climb 47% higher this year to hit $418.51 billion to lift its EPS by 131%.

At the moment, Exxon's sales and earnings are projected to pull back off these levels in 2023. But the expected YoY dip hardly signals a huge economic slowdown.

Other Fundamentals

Exxon's Oil and Gas -Integrated–International industry sits in the top 12% of over 250 Zacks industries. Exxon's stellar 2021 helped it repay about $20 billion in debt, or most of the total debt it borrowed during the pandemic downturn.

The company's ratio of net debt to capital dropped to 13%, which should help it thrive even as oil hovers around $90 a barrel.

The reduced debt load and high margins are also helping the firm return tons of value to shareholders. XOM said earlier this year it would triple its share repurchases, while slightly increasing its oil-field spending and production.

Exxon's 3.8% dividend yield provides investors solid income that tops its highly-ranked industry's average. XOM's yield also crushes the 10-year U.S. Treasury's 2.88% and the S&P 500's 1.4%.

Bottom Line

Exxon shares have soared 125% in the last two years to outclimb its industry's 78% and the S&P 500's 27%. This stretch of success includes a 54% surge in 2022 vs. the benchmark's 11% decline and its industry's 28% gain.

XOM did drop rather significantly off its early June highs of $105 per share to around $83 in the middle of July. Exxon has bounced back to around $94 a share, which still offers 8% upside vs. its current Zacks consensus price target. And the stock has found strong support at some key technical levels over the last year.

Despite its climb, Exxon is trading at a 40% discount to its year-long highs at 8.3X forward 12-month earnings. This also marks a 25% discount to its year-long median and right near its lows not only over the past 12 months but over the last 10 years. The nearby chart showcases its strong valuation, with the Covid demand evaporation creating that strange vertical section in 2020.

Bear of the Day:

Nvidia is a chip superstar that's expanded its reach far beyond the gaming industry into data centers and beyond.

The GPU maker has, however, come under pressure due to slowing demand as consumers shift their spending habits. Nvidia on August 8 provided downbeat preliminary second quarter FY23 guidance that forced analysts to trim their earnings outlooks. And the stock is still down over 35% in 2022.

Nvidia Basics

Nvidia transformed into a Wall Street favorite in the chip space on the back of its ability to supply the growing gaming industry with great processors.

Yet it was NVDA's expansion into and success within the booming world of data centers and cloud computing that established Nvidia as a global technology titan and the largest U.S. chipmaker by market cap.

Despite its ability to grow over the long-haul within crucial tech industries, Nvidia is still exposed to the broader cyclical nature of the semiconductor market. Nvidia on August 8 offered up preliminary second quarter revenue guidance of $6.70 billion vs. its initial outlook of $8.10 billion, driven by a big slowdown in gaming.

Nvidia said that the shortfall relative to the May revenue outlook is ""primarily attributable to lower sell-in of Gaming products reflecting a reduction in channel partner sales likely due to macroeconomic headwinds."" Nvidia said its overall Q2 revenue is still projected to climb 3% YoY, with data centers sales up 61% and gaming down 33%.

Bottom Line

The lowered gaming guidance was accompanied by slightly-lower-than-projected data center revenue. The new outlook is set to eat into its margins and bottom line. Nvidia's updated earnings estimates help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment, alongside its ""F"" grades for Value and Momentum in our Style Score system.

Nvidia's Semiconductor – General industry is currently in the bottom third of over 250 Zacks industries. NVDA stock is down around 36% in 2022 and it's still trading at 48.8X forward 12-month earnings vs. its industry's 25.1X average.

NVDA is, of course, one of the largest tech stocks on the planet and it's poised to thrive over the long-haul. But it might be prudent for investors to shy away from Nvidia for the moment until it provides updated full-year guidance when it officially reports on August 24.

3 Long-Term EV Plays to Reap Benefits from the Climate Bill

President Biden has signed the sweeping climate change bill into law. The bill — also called the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — is the boldest climate legislation in U.S. history. The landmark bill seeks to allot around $370 billion toward clean energy initiatives to turbocharge decarbonization efforts, which would put the United States on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 40% below 2005 levels by the decade-end.

The electric vehicle (EV) space is likely to emerge as one of the beneficiaries of the new climate bill.  As it is, amid heightening climate concerns and technological advancement, more and more cars are getting electrified as legacy automakers are fast shifting gears to e-mobility. And now this IRA is set to further supercharge the prospects of the EV industry.

To capitalize on the e-mobility future, consider adding to your watchlist the EV king Tesla as well as two auto giants that are rapidly revving up their electrification game— General Motors and Ford. Before discussing these stocks, let's take a look at the key takeaways of the climate bill for the automakers.

IRA to Unlock EV Discounts Albeit With Caveats

The bill seeks to transform the U.S. auto industry with incentives that would induce automakers to accelerate the production of zero-emission vehicles in an effort to meet environmental goals.

To encourage the adoption of EVs, the IRA includes a $7,500 tax credit till 2032 on the purchase of a new EV. Importantly, the tax credit will be sans the 200,000-car cap. In the current scenario, the tax credit phases out once a company has reached the 200,000 EV sales mark. A few auto biggies, including Tesla, General Motors and Toyota, have already exhausted the limit. The updated EV tax credit would remove that cap at the start of 2023.Beginning next year, the vehicles of these auto giants will again become eligible for a tax credit as long as they are manufactured in North America and meet the raw material sourcing requirements.

This brings us to one of the major concerns that automakers are set to face. The new bill has provisions for tax credits only for vehicles that are assembled in North America. In other words, the law immediately disqualifies any EV produced outside North America to take advantage of the incentives. Going by that, around 70% of the 72 models currently eligible for the $7,500 tax credits will no longer get the benefits, per the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. Notably, some of the mass market brands, including the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and Toyota Rav4 Prime are no more eligible for the tax credit as they are not domestically manufactured.

And things would get tougher with the raw material sourcing criterion that comes into effect in 2023. Notably, the raw materials for the vehicle batteries should be procured only from countries with which the United States has free-trade agreements, starting from 2023. While the bill surely seeks to promote domestic battery manufacturing, many EVs will get disqualified for the credit benefit right off the bat.

There's also a new $4,000 credit on used EVs, which are priced at $25,000 or less. But to be eligible for the tax credit for a used vehicle, the gross annual income of a family should not exceed $150,000 (for joint tax filers) or $75,000 (for individual tax filers).

For the new vehicles to qualify for tax credits, the sticker price for sedans should be below $55,000. Meanwhile, SUVs, trucks and vans, should not be costing more than $80,000.To qualify for the new EV credit, buyers' taxable income will be capped at $150,000 if they are single filers or $300,000 for joint filers.

While on the surface, the IRA looks like a sure-fire legislation to fast-track the EV industry, things are not that hunky dory. With the new legislation, it may get difficult for many cars to qualify for the credit right, considering the sticker price and income caps. And most importantly the fact that the law requires the cars and batteries to be ""made in America"" remains a major limitation.

So, the new legislation may not be much beneficial for automakers, which don't manufacture a large number of EVs in the United States or certain EV upstarts whose vehicles are too expensive to qualify for credit. Meanwhile, companies like Tesla, General Motors and Ford stand to benefit from the new climate bill as they have reorganized their supply chains to manufacture vehicles in America.

3 Stocks in Focus

Tesla: With the sales threshold removal under the new bill, Tesla will regain eligibility for incentives beginning 2023 for its entry-level, Model 3 RWD variant, which is priced under $55,000. With both variants of Model Y classified as SUVs and meeting the price caps, they would also qualify for tax credits. Industry watchdogs believe that Tesla is the closest in terms of fulfilling the raw material sourcing requirements from the United States or trading allies, as mandated by the new law.

This EV behemoth currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The robust demand for Models 3 and Y is buoying Tesla's revenues. High volumes are also aiding Tesla in achieving production efficiencies, thereby strengthening gross margins. The company's long-term expected EPS growth rate is 31.2%.

General Motors: While GM has also exhausted its quota of 200,000 electric cars, it will again qualify from next year now with the new climate bill. The company has numerous affordable EV brands that will be eligible for the $7,500 tax credit. These include Cadillac Lyriq, Chevy Bolt EV, Chevy Bolt EUV, Chevy Silverado EV, Chevy Blazer EV, Chevy Equinox EV and GMC Sierra EV. Silverado and Sierra EVs will only be eligible for lower trim levels considering the price cap.

General Motors, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), intends to roll out 30 EV models by 2025-end. GM's Factory ZERO and plants in Spring Hill and CAMI are setting the stage for the company's electrification goals. GM's Ultium Drive system is scaling up its e-mobility prowess. The company's long-term expected EPS growth rate is 10%.

Ford: In May, Ford's CEO Farley notified that he expected the Ford EV tax credits to dry up by late 2022 or early 2023. But with the elimination of the quota of 200,000 cars, Ford's popular EV models stand to take advantage of the discounts under the bill. Both Mustang Mach E and F-150 Lightning are eligible for the tax credit, considering their manufacturing status and sticker price. All trim levels of Mustang Mach E— manufactured in Mexico with prices well below the $80,000 threshold for SUVs —qualify. Built in Michigan, all Standard Range models of the F-Lightning e truck that will fall below the $80,000 threshold qualify for the tax credit.

Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The firm's aggressive EV push, with planned spending of around $50 billion by 2026 and the target production of over 2 million EVs by 2026-end (representing 70% CAGR), augurs well for long-term growth. By 2030, Ford expects EVs to account for 50% of its global sales, which will cement its position in the red-hot EV landscape. The company's long-term expected EPS growth rate is 9.1%.

524,"Is Most-Watched Stock Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Worth Betting on Now?","Tesla (TSLA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned +11.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +12% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has gained 23.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Tesla is expected to post earnings of $2.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.84 points to a change of +74.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.9%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.44 indicates a change of +30.4% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.8%.

Story continues

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TSLA _12MonthEPSChartUrl

Revenue Growth Forecast

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

In the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $22.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +66.8%. The $85.14 billion and $120.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +58.2% and +41.2%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Tesla reported revenues of $16.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +41.6%. EPS of $2.27 for the same period compares with $1.45 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.98%. The EPS surprise was +24.73%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Tesla is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

525,10 Best Self-Driving Stocks To Invest In,"In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best self-driving stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our industry introduction, and want to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Best Self-Driving Stocks To Invest In.

The boom in information technology has disrupted and revolutionized a wide variety of industries and brought new technologies to the consumer. One such area is the autonomous driving sector, which uses advanced technologies such as machine learning to predict the road environment and minimize the input required from a driver while driving.

This allure of self-driving technologies has piqued investor interest and resulted in making Elon Musk one of the richest people in human history. While it is widely believed that Musk's net worth — courtesy of the meteoric share price increase of his company Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares — is due to electric vehicles, the reality is that investors have also bet on Tesla's vast pool of vehicle data that the company is using to train algorithms for autonomous driving.

Taking a look at industry research reports for the sector, we find out that several firms have laid down optimistic projections for autonomous driving. For instance, Fortune Business Insights estimates that from a value of $1.64 billion from the end of last year, this market will grow at a strong compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.3% to stand at $11.3 billion as 2028 ends.

Precedence Research also takes a wager at estimating the number of units in the market, and projects that by 2030 end, there will be 65 million self-driving cars on the roads. It also lays down current and future market values in dollar terms alongside a growth rate, outlining that the market was worth $15 billion in 2021 and will be worth $21 billion by 2030 through a CAGR of 3.97%. Asia Pacific will fuel this growth as the living standards of populations increase and a high number of people belonging to the working age group spearhead their automobile purchases.

Story continues

Finally, Markets and Markets also believes that there were 20.3 million autonomous driving units on the roads in 2021 and this will grow to 62.4 million in 2030 through a 13.3% CAGR. It also explains that Asia Pacific will drive this growth and outlines that autonomous driving also has advantages for the ride sharing market as it has the potential to drastically reduce the costs per mile paid by passengers. However, the most optimistic take for the sector's monetary value is from Allied Markets Research, as the firm pegs down the value of the global autonomous vehicle market to a whopping $2 trillion by 2030 through an unbelievable CAGR of 40%.

Our list consists of a variety of firms, some of which sell cars while others focus on trucks and components used in self-driving. Some of the popular names likely to catch your attention are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).

526,BMW AG's (BAMXF) Next-Gen EVs to Get Eve Energy's Batteries,"The next generation of Bayerische Motoren Werke BAMXF or the BMW Group’s electric vehicles (EVs) in Europe will get a supply of battery cells from battery cell manufacturer Eve Energy, from 2025, per sources. The auto magnate’s ‘New Class’ electric cars will be provided with large, cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells.

The China-based firm stated that its production line is under construction, and supply will commence after negotiations by both parties.

Eve Energy was established in 2001 and listed on the Shenzhen GEM in 2009. Over a span of nearly two decades, it has become a globally competitive lithium battery platform company. Its core technologies and comprehensive solutions for consumer and power batteries have gained popularity over the years.

Rectangular prismatic batteries have emerged as the most common form in the auto industry in the past two years as they are economical owing to their dense packaging. However, of late, cylindrical batteries have gathered steam as these are believed to be more cost-saving due to upgrades introduced in the energy density.

BMW has been taking great strides in electrification with a target of more than 1.5 million electric cars by 2030. To live up to the tough competition in the EV domain, it is following the footsteps of the global EV giant, Tesla Inc. TSLA, which started manufacturing larger-format cylindrical battery cells this year. Reports surfaced in May that BMW intends to switch from prismatic cells to round cells for its New Class series. During that time, it was assumed that Samsung SDI would be the default option for BMW as the Korea-based battery maker already had plans for a production plant for such batteries. Recent news, however, suggests a different picture.

It is also believed that Eve Energy will supply BMW’s plant under construction in Debrecen, Hungary, where the New Class will initially be built locally. Moreover, according to media reports, Eve Energy has signed a contract with BMW to become its main battery supplier for the EVs to be launched in Europe in 2025. A while ago, another China-based battery cell manufacturer CATL announced that it will build its second cell factory in Debrecen. In the light of this news, it is therefore not yet certain whether Eve Energy will be the sole supplier for BMW or one among many. There have not yet been any comments from BMW. It is expected to come up with some battery-related announcements at the beginning of September and provide some clarification.

BMW has been boosting its orders for battery cells to cater to the demand surge for EVs. The progress in its ChargeForward plan, the first smart charging program offering customers the scope to maximize the integration of renewable energy while optimizing EV charging, augurs well. Moreover, it has been reported that BMW intends to build five gigafactories for electric car batteries through partnerships, strategically positioned globally at places where the auto biggie manufactures its EVs. It is only recently that BMW entered into battery manufacture, but once it has set its focus, it appears that it has laid out an ambitious target.

Shares of BAMXF have lost 12.2% over the past year compared with its industry’s 22.6% decline.

527,10 Best Small-Cap Nickel Stocks to Buy Now,"In this article, we discuss 10 best small-cap nickel stocks to buy now. If you want to read about some more small-cap nickel stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Best Small-Cap Nickel Stocks to Buy Now.

Nickel has steadily climbed the mining ladder in the past few years, coming to dominate discussions around the growth of electric vehicles and the rise in production of stainless steel products. Nickel is an important raw material used in both products. In EVs, nickel is used to manufacture cathodes in lithium-ion batteries. Nickel sourced from sulfide and limonite deposits is ideal for this purpose. Nickel also readily combines with other metals and has corrosion-resistant properties at high temperatures, hence it is used in stainless steel products.

There has been a shortage in supply of the metal in the past few months due to a rise in post-pandemic demand coupled with supply chain problems. Despite these headwinds, the International Nickel Study Group estimates that nickel usage increased by more than 16% last year and caused a supply shortfall of 168,000 tons. Per the group, the usage for nickel in 2022 will increase by close to 9%, climbing over 3 million tons. Supply shortages will decrease as production from a new Indonesian plant is expected to result in surplus tons of nickel.

Some of the prominent stocks that will benefit from this rising production of nickel include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX). Even as production booms, there are concerns that a demand slowdown from China, the largest stainless steel producing nation in the world, might affect nickel usage overall. However, the fast growth of the EV sector will likely overshadow China worries, per investment bank Goldman Sachs.

The bank estimates that nickel usage in the EV battery sector will increase by 62% to 285,000 tons in 2022 and by another 26% to 358,000 tons in 2023. Indonesian markets will be the biggest beneficiary of this mini-boom for the nickel sector in the coming months. The country provides a bulk of the metal to industries in China, both for EV battery production and stainless steel. In 2021, the country mined 40% of the global production of the metal.

Story continues

Investors looking for more exposure to the nickel space, which is also a great way to ride the boom in EVs and steel, but are not willing to invest in expensive mining stocks, there are several little-known nickel stocks that offer tremendous growth potential in the sector. Many firms in the space, especially in the small-cap range, have the potential to explode in the coming years as the demand for the metal rises significantly.

Our Methodology

The companies that operate in the nickel sector and had a market capitalization between $250 million to $2 billion, as of August 19, were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details.

532,"Apple workers fear a ‘draconian’ return-to-office plan like Tesla’s, with an overcrowded office and tracked attendance","Apple CEO Tim Cook keeps trying to bring workers back into the office, only to find his efforts thwarted by continual coronavirus waves. After rolling out a slow hybrid plan in April, the company delayed such efforts in May due to an uptick in COVID-19 cases.

That left Apple employees continuing to work from home with the option to go into the office as they please. Not to be deterred, Apple recently announced that employees are set to finally return to the office three days a week starting September 5.

But some Apple workers fear the office isn’t ready for the influx of workers, according to their comments on Blind, an anonymous message board for techies. Blind users are mostly corporate employees who work in engineering or product, Rich Chen, director of public relations at Blind, previously told Fortune.

While Apple employees are not threatening to quit over the RTO mandate with as much ire as they did in the spring, they’re speaking of growing pains and worried about having their attendance tracked. (Apple did not respond to requests for comment.)

“I thought I was all for [a] return to office but God d*mn, is Apple park packed,” an Apple employee said on Blind, adding that the offices are overloaded: ”On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I can barely hear myself think when everyone is having a separate conversation, people’s phones are off silent getting a million messages a minute, and don’t even get me started on conference room availability.”

Another Apple employee explained the root of the problem: “three years of expansion while offices did not.”

Apple went on a hiring spree in 2021, recruiting top cloud talent. But a growing workforce may put the tech giant face-to-face with the same return-to-office dilemma Tesla dealt with: not having enough physical resources. After Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that employees return to the office this summer, workers found there were not enough desks or parking spaces for everyone who had been hired over the last couple of years. Some Tesla employees told The Information that shaky Wi-Fi couldn’t even handle all the workers.

Apple workers aren't just concerned about an office space that has outgrown its britches. They’re also waiting for an onslaught of employee monitoring in which their office attendance is tracked—not unlike the way Tesla tracks how often its workers ""badge in.""

“Time logging is coming as well,” an Apple employee forecasted on Blind. “You will need to badge out so that they keep a tab. Draconian times are upon us.”

Another employee dryly joked that they were unsure if their bathroom breaks would be monitored, while another was more worried about getting to Apple’s overflowing parking lot. “Here we come traffic jams and hours-long travel,” commented another Apple employee.

Some workers said they could be enticed to return to the office by free perks like drinks and corporate lunches, but others were quick to shoot that down. “Where do you get free salad?"" one employee wrote in response. ""Also free coffee is not drinkable, I get my own Keurig cups.”

“Apple has free coffee and salad? I thought Tom Cook was too frugal for that,” chimed in a second worker.

Apple has historically offered free dinners for iOS or OS X team members, as well as subsidized cafés that gave employees a tax break by allowing them to pay for meals using a payroll deduction plan, according to Insider. The cafés offer everything from seafood to barbecue, and apparently apples are free. Whether the food is good is a matter of taste buds.

Workers will have the chance to ask all their questions about bathroom breaks and food perks given their eventual arrival in a couple weeks. Knock on wood for Apple that there’s not another coronavirus wave on the horizon.

534,Tesla Short Scott Burg Makes Multibillion-Dollar Bet Against Elon Musk's Firm,"(Bloomberg) -- While Elon Musk has plenty of Wall Street detractors, Scott Burg may be the first distressed-bond manager to make a multibillion-dollar options bet that Musk’s Tesla Inc. will be “squashed like a bug.”

Burg, the chief investment officer of Deer Park Road Management Co. who made the prediction in a 2020 tweet, acquired put options on almost 4.8 million Tesla shares during the second quarter, according to a regulatory filing this week. The shares covered by the puts had a face value of about $3.2 billion at the end of June, though the amount the firm has at risk would be far lower.

After stepping up criticism of Tesla and Musk on social media this year, Burg abruptly deleted his Twitter account Wednesday following an email inquiry from Bloomberg about the put options. Deer Park didn’t return messages seeking comment, nor did Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.

The Tesla wager is one of several bearish bets Deer Park made earlier this year using puts, which increase in value when an underlying asset declines. In the first quarter, Deer Park acquired puts on the S&P 500 with a face value of about $20 billion, more than four times the firm’s net assets of $4.6 billion at the end of March.

“We have been strategically positioned within the fund to ensure downside protection through the use of our hedging practices,” Deer Park, based in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, told investors in a June letter obtained by Bloomberg. “Our hedging program has also provided substantial gains which have enabled the fund to generate liquidity by monetizing a portion of these proceeds.”

STS Master, the firm’s flagship structured credit fund, gained 8.65% in the first half of 2022, with almost all of the gains coming from options, swaps and hedges, according to company documents obtained by Bloomberg. The documents don’t provide returns for Deer Park 1850, a fund with $709 million of assets at year-end that the firm manages on behalf of a single investor.

STS Master’s fortunes reversed sharply in July, when the fund tumbled roughly 6.5%, putting it on track for its worst quarter ever if results don’t improve by the end of September. The loss pared the fund’s 2022 gain to 2.2%, the firm told clients in an email Friday, after Bloomberg reported on the short wager.

“The significant rally in risk assets in July largely reversed the hedged gains from June,” Deer Park wrote. “The volatility this year absolutely highlights the importance of the long-term performance (and protection) of the portfolio beyond monthly activity.”

Shares of Austin, Texas-based Tesla tumbled 38% in the second quarter amid mounting concerns about production disruptions at the electrical-vehicle maker’s factory in Shanghai. The stock has rebounded sharply since June 30, surging 35% through Thursday’s close. In its filing this week, Deer Park didn’t disclose strike prices or expiration dates for the options it purchased.

Deer Park focuses mainly on distressed securities, including mortgage-backed and corporate debt, though it also has leeway to invest in stocks and equity derivatives, according to a filing.

Little known outside Wall Street, Deer Park has generated average annual returns of about 19% since founder Michael Craig-Scheckman, one of the first employees at Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management, started STS Master during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2010, Craig-Scheckman hired Burg, who started a firm to price hard-to-value securities.

Twitter Inc. itself may have been a catalyst for Deer Park to load up on Tesla put options in the second quarter.

In April, Musk made an unsolicited bid to acquire the social media platform for $44 billion, only to try to pull out of the deal after a market rout crushed tech stocks. The two parties are now engaged in a court battle that has weighed on Tesla shares, in part because Musk sold billions of dollars of his personal stake in case he’s forced to complete the deal.

“Do you know what a death spiral is? Coming...$TSLAQ,” Burg tweeted on May 20, when shares of Tesla, which trades under the ticker TSLA, tumbled 6.4%.

Stock exchanges typically add the letter Q to a company’s ticker when it files for bankruptcy protection.

535,"GM stock is about to dust Tesla stock, analyst says","Back up the Corvette and shovel General Motors stock into the trunk, one top Wall Street auto analyst says in a new note to clients on Friday.

Citi's Itay Michaeli came out with an $87 price target on General Motors. If you run the math, Michaeli is looking for about 187% upside in GM shares. By comparison, Michaeli — who has an under-perform rating on Tesla — expects shares of Elon Musk's creation to tank 52%.

GM shares rose 2% on Friday.

Michaeli points to several catalysts for GM's stock headed into 2023 following a meeting with the company's executive team. They include:

Strong auto demand continuing. September unveiling of an EV Equinox crossover. September investor event for GM's autonomous driving unit Cruise. Production ramp for GM's Ultium batteries, which should help bring down EV production costs. November investor day in New York City. Declining commodities costs.

""We were encouraged by management's tone at our meeting,"" Michaeli added. A badge of Cadillac, an automobile brand owned by General Motors Company, is seen on the grill of a vehicle for sale at a car dealership in Queens, New York, U.S., November 16, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly

The automaker also reinstated its dividend to 9 cents a share — it had been halted since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020 — and lifted its share buyback plan to $5 billion from $3.3 billion.

""GM is investing more than $35 billion through 2025 to advance our growth plan, including rapidly expanding our electric vehicle portfolio and creating a domestic battery manufacturing infrastructure,"" said GM CEO Mary Barra in a statement. ""Progress on these key strategic initiatives has improved our visibility and strengthened confidence in our capacity to fund growth while also returning capital to shareholders.""

536,10 Best Fidelity Funds to Buy Now,"In turbulent times, investors would be well served considering the best Fidelity funds to buy now. Primarily, Fidelity represents an organization with a well-earned reputation for viability and stability.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our population grew at 0.1% in 2021, the slowest rate since the founding of the nation. While so much talk exists in the media about labor and inflation, prior paradigms always featured a rising population level. In contrast, we could be facing declining demographic trends, which inherently bolster the best Fidelity funds to buy now.

Put another way, we’re navigating uncharted territory so we’re making things up as we go along.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Another factor to consider with the best Fidelity funds to buy now is their diversity. Investors can gain exposure to various markets and themes. Further, if any one individual holding lags, others can potentially lift up the fund.

Given the variability of this environment, here are some ideas to consider for the best Fidelity funds to buy now.

FXAIX Fidelity 500 Index Fund $148.96 FSPHX Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio $28.07 FLGEX Fidelity Large Cap Growth Enhanced Index Fund $27.08 FDVLX Fidelity Value Fund $14.50 FBCG Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF $25.74 ONEQ Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF $49.85 FENY Fidelity MSCI Energy Index ETF $21.94 FCPI Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF $32.40 FOCPX Fidelity OTC Portfolio $15.48 FDVV Fidelity High Dividend ETF $39.49

A mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500, buying into the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (MUTF:FXAIX) represents a market wager on America. If you follow the advice of the Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett, you’ll know that he urged investors to never bet against America. The FXAIX fund allows you Buffett fans to put your money where your mouth is.

One of the best Fidelity funds to buy now for the long haul, the FXAIX doesn’t pull any punches. Its top three holdings are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Combined, these three companies feature a market capitalization of nearly $6.3 trillion. For context, that’s about half of China’s entire GDP.

Story continues

Better yet, the FXAIX is cheap to own, featuring a net expense ratio of 0.02% and a management fee of 0.015%, which are well below their respective category averages.

A major factor bolstering the best Fidelity funds to buy now is that they allow investors to buy into trends as opposed to single stocks. Moving forward, easily one of the biggest trends is healthcare. With baby boomers retiring en masse, healthcare demands will almost surely rise. As well, the growing threat of deadly diseases incentivizes the biotechnological and pharmaceutical industries to continue research and development initiatives.

Therefore, if you’re looking for the ultimate in buy-and-hold ideas, the Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio (MUTF:FSPHX) mutual fund represents an excellent choice. Its top three holdings are UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).

Finally, FSPHX represents a good deal relative to category averages. Its net expense ratio of 0.67% and management fee of 0.52% are below the respective averages of 1.18% and 0.72%.

Fidelity Large Cap Growth Enhanced Index Fund (FLGEX) Large-cap written on a stock ticker. Large-cap stocks.

According to the prospectus for the Fidelity Large Cap Growth Enhanced Index Fund (MUTF:FLGEX), the FLGEX normally invests at least 80% of assets in common stocks included in the Russell 1000. This index is market-cap weighted, designed to measure the performance of the large-cap growth segment of the equities sector.

Its top three holdings mimic that of the aforementioned Fidelity 500 Index Fund. Utilizing quantitative analytics to find the best high-growth opportunities among the largest players in the game, the FLGEX concentrates most its focus on the technology sector, representing 42.4% of all holdings. Next up is consumer cyclical at nearly 16% and communication services at 9.5%.

As with the other best Fidelity funds to buy now, the FLGEX is relatively cheap. Its net expense ratio of 0.39% and management fee (also 0.39%) are significantly below their respective category averages.

On the opposite end of the growth equation is of course value. Sure enough, the Fidelity Value Fund (MUTF:FDVLX) lets you know right off the bat what it’s all about. The beauty here is that the FDVLX focuses largely on lesser-known entities. While such a strategy is typically higher risk, investors enjoy the benefit of exposure to promising enterprises.

Currently, the mutual fund’s top three holdings are Antero Resources (NYSE:AR), Hess (NYSE:HES) and Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE). In terms of sector weighting, the FDVLX is more balanced than other funds, with the heaviest allocation belonging to industrials at 19.4%. Energy (14%) and consumer cyclical (13.4%) round out the top three sectors.

Following in line with the theme of comparative solid deals, the net expense ratio of 0.79% and the management fee of 0.65% are below their respective category averages of 1.05% and 0.68%.

Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks

Many investors may prefer ETFs over mutual funds. One of the main differences is that generally speaking, mutual funds are actively managed while ETFs are passively managed. In turn, the latter may feature superior cost structures.

For those that are seeking higher-growth opportunities with some of the biggest names in business, the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (BATS:FBCG) may be an appropriate idea. The ETF’s top three holdings are the usual suspects: Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. However, FBCG also features popular names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

In terms of weighting, FBCG concentrates the most in tech at 41.7%, followed by consumer cyclical (25.4%) and healthcare (7.5%). The major drawback, though, is that FBCG is a tad expensive with an expense ratio of 0.59%. The category average is 0.55%.

Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (ONEQ) Bright signs for Nasdaq (NDAQ) cover the Nasdaq building in Times Square.

Though the tech sector presents some of the most exciting public companies, it’s also among the riskiest. Often tied to an aspirational narrative, firms that lead in innovative ideas can also spectacularly fail. That’s one reason why the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) cuts an interesting figure. By distributing the risk across multiple tech names, ONEQ investors can focus on themes rather than individual business plans.

As with the other best Fidelity funds to buy now, ONEQ runs with the biggest companies in the U.S. with its top four holdings: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla. At the same time, ONEQ varies its exposure, which include companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).

What people will undoubtedly appreciate is that ONEQ is attractively priced. Featuring an expense ratio of 0.21%, it’s well below the category average of 0.55%.

Despite all the political talk about going green, the harsh reality is that hydrocarbon energy sources will likely be relevant for decades to come. The issue comes down to capacity factors. While wind and solar draw plenty of attention, their capacity factors – essentially their measurement of reliability – are 35.4% and 24.9%, respectively. On the other hand, natural gas has a capacity factor of 56.6%.

Further, geopolitical tensions imply that energy demands will likely boom again. Therefore, it’s time to advantage the lull in the sector and consider the Fidelity MSCI Energy Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FENY).

FENY’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Further, the ETF features an expense ratio of only 0.08%, well below the category average of 0.43%. Therefore, it’s a viable candidate for the best Fidelity funds to buy now.

Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF (FCPI) Inflation written on dice with red arrows going up. Inflation.

Source: stockwerk-fotodesign / Shutterstock

Say what you want about the consumer price index easing slightly to 8.5%, to borrow the Wall Street Journal’s language. Regular folks don’t live and breathe by indices and other lofty gauges. Instead, if prices are high at the grocery aisle and the gas pump – and wages aren’t keeping up – consumers are likely to complain. In other words, nothing much has changed.

Given the possibly nasty and protracted battle with inflation that we have before us, the Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF (BATS:FCPI) makes plenty of sense. The ETF focuses on public companies that tend to do well during inflationary cycles. Therefore, aside from Apple and Microsoft, the FCPI includes Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) and Nucor (NYSE:NUE) among its top holdings.

About the only drawback is that FCPI is somewhat pricey. Featuring an expense ratio of 0.29%, it’s not that far removed from the category average of 0.42%.

Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX) A ticker tape reads ""OTC"" in big letters.

Going back to mutual funds, this segment has a reputation for highlighting safe-but-boring names. However, the Fidelity OTC Portfolio (MUTF:FOCPX) proves that sometimes, mutual funds can dial up the spiciness. The FOCPX fund mostly focuses on companies either listed on the Nasdaq exchange or the over-the-counter market.

To be fair, OTC-listed securities don’t always mean penny stocks. Several reasons exist why certain companies prefer their shares to be traded in the pink sheets. Mainly, it comes down to the cost structures associated with listing on a proper exchange. Still, the FOCPX brings some intriguing ideas to the table, even though its core holdings represent the usual suspects.

In terms of fees, the FOCPX is somewhat of a mixed bag. On the net expense ratio side of things, it pings as 0.8%, below the category average of 1.01%. However, the management fee of 0.66% is higher than the category average of 0.62%.

Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV) stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text

Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.com

Finally, to round out this list of the best Fidelity funds to buy now, investors ought to consider the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). According to its prospectus, the FDVV is “designed to reflect the performance of stocks of large and mid-capitalization high-dividend-paying companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends.”

Its top two holdings of Apple and Microsoft are not surprising; other names among the best Fidelity funds to buy now feature them. However, to presumably bolster the dividend portion of its objective, the FDVV features Exxon Mobil and Chevron as its No. 3 and No. 4 holdings.

However, those seeking shelter from the inflationary storm will have to pay a bit of a premium. The expense ratio of this dividend ETF is 0.29%. While below the category average of 0.38%, it leans on the higher end of the spectrum.

The mega-rich have built habits that have led them to be successful, but there are plenty of memes and real-life, in-depth stories that will tell you the opposite. You’ll see stories discrediting Jeff Bezos’ “garage startup” called Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) because he received $300,000 from his parents, or that Elon Musk was far from a self-starter because his father was a rich Engineer in South Africa.

Something we forget is that we are allowed to acknowledge both sides. Of course, Bezos and Musk had a massive advantage given the position their parents put them in. Of course, their upbringing was atypical, privileged, and not what you envision when you hear of stories about ‘ground-up, self-starters, etc’. However, we can also applaud their ability to maintain and grow with the tools they were provided.

See, just having money does not make success a forgone conclusion. How many lottery winners wind up broke? Various reports say 70%. Yet, when we imagine hitting it big, we all say we’d be “set for life”.

The point is, that long-term success can’t be luck or privilege. There are too many opportunities for stupid decisions that people like Musk and Bezos have to avoid on a daily basis to have their fortunes be made by accident. Sure, it’s uncommon to find yourself at the same starting point that any billionaire on this list found themselves at in the beginning. But, it’s absolutely within our control to learn from the discipline, the business savvy and the ability to make smart long-term plays to manage your money, assets and wealth. While each of these moves may not be perfect for any individual's set of circumstances, it’s worth looking into the types of risks these billionaires find to be worth it.

With all that being said, what were the world’s wealthiest getting into this week (8/12/22 - 8/19/22)?

Story continues

Bill Gates is already Ecolab Inc’s (NYSE: ECL) largest shareholder. But this week, according to Barrons, the billionaire and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder doubled down on this investment, purchasing even more. The move may resemble something you can use in your own portfolio. Ecolab is down nearly 27% YTD. Gates saw a stock he clearly believed in when he made his original investment. Despite the stock being down, he likes and believes in the company and doubled down on his instinct. If you believe in the product, just pretend that that stock is on sale.

One reason for the move in Ecolab may have to do with a story reported on Yahoo! Finance, crediting Gates for saving Biden’s Climate Bill. Bloomberg Green reported that “One of the world’s richest men felt he had to give one of the nation’s most powerful lawmakers a little pep talk...” The same article claims that Gates has sunk tens of millions into green cement startups like Ecocem, CHEMent, and Brimstone Energy.

There was also the matter of nuclear fission startup TerraPower. TerraPower, obviously not yet on market, has raised well over $700 million to develop advanced nuclear reactors to serve as alternatives to the existing reactors that make up the vast majority of the world’s civilian nuclear fleet. Set to be in operation by 2028 and with a price tag of $4 Billion, these are not moves to be taken lightly. You can read more about TerraPower at CanaryMedia. One interesting investing note on the matter is where the startup is getting its money from. Investments include over $250 million from a group in South Korea and previous funding being contributed by none other than..

Warren Buffett may be plotting for the future by backing Gates, but in the present moment, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) just received approval on August 19, 2022, to purchase up to 50% of oil giant Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY). The news of Buffett’s involvement alone helped the stock jump nearly 10% to close the day. Berkshire is already heavily invested in the company, which has led to some speculation regarding Buffett’s willingness to buy the entire company. CNBC reported “He will likely continue to buy as much as he can get below $70 or $75. If you own 30% or 40% and would like to buy it out at $95 or $100, you saved a lot of money,” said Cole Smead, president of Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire shareholder. “This stock trades like a casino. The market is giving him all the stock he wants.”

Jeff Bezos made a ton of money betting on startups as well. In fact, he likely made a fortune by investing in Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ: ABNB) nearly a decade before they went public. Bezos has an eye for up and comers in the Real Estate sector, as he was one of several high-profile investors to participate in Arrived Homes’ seed round in 2021. Arrived Homes is a real estate investment platform that allows retail investors to buy shares of single-family rental properties with as little as $100.

Bezos’ Amazon was in the news this week, as the company filed a legal complaint accusing the Federal Trade Commission of ""harassing"" current and former executives, naturally including Bezos himself. The filing made on August 5, 2022, hasn’t hurt the company, as Amazon is up nearly 13% over the past month.

Elon Musk also stayed in the news, per usual, this week. There was the tweet about purchasing Manchester United PLC (NYSE: MANU), which was quickly clarified as a joke by Musk himself. He likely had to clarify since Man. U. is a publicly traded company. CNN discussed the potential for SEC action against Musk regarding the matter, but it seems unlikely. However, Musk needs to be careful, as his tweets literally move markets. Manchester United jumped immediately following the tweet and is up $2.50 in the past month.

Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) seems to get Musk in hot water in more ways than one lately. Aside from trolling, thanking Billie Eillish and general mockery, there’s the whole matter of... acquiring the entire company. The purchase has been in the news for months, but there was an interesting development this week. Musk’s team used Botometer to estimate that 33% of visible accounts on the platform were simply spam or fake. However, Botometer creator and maintainer Kaicheng Yang said the figure ""doesn't mean anything"". BBC tackled the story in depth.

Finally, Musk’s baby, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) made news for several reasons this week. On Friday, Musk stated that Tesla is slowing down the rollout of its next “Full Self-Driving Beta” software update (10.69) due to “many major code changes.” Musk’s full tweet said: “There are many major code changes, so this will be an extra cautious rollout. Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners, then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback & release to ~10k customers, then 10.69.2 week after & release to rest of FSD Beta.”

The news comes during the same week that Indonesian President Joko Widodo urged Tesla to manufacture its cars and batteries in the country. The President and Musk talked previously about the mov and had met earlier this year. The Indonesian President envisions the country as a hub for all EVs, not just batteries. Approaching rapidly is the meeting in November when the country will host a leaders summit for the Group of 20 major economies. It should be noted that Tesla isn’t the only EV company on Indonesia’s radar, as they already have investments or planned investments from Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM), Mitsubishi Corp (OTCMKTS: MSBHF), and Hyundai Motor Company (OTCMKTS: HYMTF).

A couple of takeaways:

Invest in what you're passionate about. Despite what you may think about Gates or Musk, or the backlash they receive, it’s clear they spend time, money and energy on the projects that matter most to them.

Double down on your investments and things that you believe in. And don’t be afraid to play both sides. If Warren Buffett can back nuclear fission, while also taking steps toward acquiring an entire oil company, you can invest in health-conscious Simply Good Foods Co (NASDAQ: SMPL) and sugar pusher Hershey Co (NYSE: HSY).

Take your time, invest in what you believe, only invest what you can afford to lose and develop positive habits by investing in yourself. Do these things, and you’ll be better for it.

555,Tesla Continues to Perform Despite Headwinds,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the world's largest electric vehicle maker, which went from near bankruptcy in 2008 to superior stardom by 2020 as the stock price jumped by over 780% in that year alone.

The company has still been performing strongly, but since its all-time highs in November 2021, the stock has corrected down by approximately 27%. According to 13F filings, George Soros (Trades, Portfolio) was buying in the second quarter when shares traded at an average price of $822, which is approximately 8% lower than where the stock was trading at the time of writing. Soros' firm loaded up on 29,883 shares with a total market value of about $25 million.

TSLA 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of TSLA Peter Lynch Chart of TSLA Tesla Continues to Perform Despite Headwinds

In this discussion, I wil break down Teslas strong quarter, which was reported in July, and highlight some of its recent developments.

Strong second quarter

Tesla generated strong financial results for the second quarter of 2022 despite several challenges. It posted revenue of $16.93 billion, which beat analysts' estimates by roughly $2 million. Tesla Continues to Perform Despite Headwinds

In its report, Tesla's management team noted:

We continued to make significant progress across the business during the second quarter of 2022. Though we faced certain challenges, including limited production and shutdowns in Shanghai for the majority of the quarter.""

Management was referring to the ongoing and widespread Covid-19 lockdowns in China as a result of the government's strict shutdown and clean policy. This resulted in a slump in sales during April and May. However, in June, EV sales made a strong comeback and popped by a blistering 130% year over year to 546,000 units. July also showed strong growth in EV sales of 110% year over year to 486,000 units.

China has the world's largest population of 1.4 billion people, a growing middle class and the world's number one EV market. The country has made a commitment to a 2060 carbon neutral plan, which does have a much longer timescale than most countries but is still better than nothing in helping to prevent climate change. Carbon neutral plans are expected to accelerate the growth for EV companies such as Tesla in China.

Story continues

Tesla is the third-largest EV maker in China with approximately 10% market share. The company has completed its Shanghai production line expansion program, which is expected to ramp up production to 22,000 vehicles per week by the end of 2022.

If we pair this with annual production from Teslas existing Fremont factory, which produces approximately 600,000 vehicles per year, with its Berlin and Austin, Texas factory ramp ups, management is confident about hitting its production goal of a staggering 1.5 million units by the end of the year. Tesla Continues to Perform Despite Headwinds

Tesla achieved one of the highest operating margins in the industry of 14.6% and strong positive free cash flow of $621 million in the second quarter. Its gross margin did fall slightly to 27.9%, but is still strong relative to the industry. Earnings per share popped to $2.27, which beat Wall Street's consensus estimates by 48 cents.

The company's energy division has achieved a record quarter on all products with the exception of solar roofing.

Self-driving vehicles

When training artificial intelligence models for self-driving vehicles, the company with the most data wins. In this case, Tesla has the most real-world driving miles of any autonomous vehicle company. In the second quarter, Tesla has racked up a staggering 35 million miles for its full self-driving Beta and is getting closer to full autonomy. As Elon Musk has stated in prior earnings calls, This is a march of 9s trying to get a probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving.

Tesla sells its bitcoin

Tesla has had a hot-and-cold relationship with bitcoin. The company invested a staggering $1.5 billion into the asset class in early 2021 and began to accept it as vehicle payment. However, it subsequently suspended the bitcoin payment option, citing environmental concerns. Then in the second quarter, the company announced, We have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency. Conversions in Q2 added $936M of cash to our balance sheet.

The company also has a fortress-like balance sheet with $18.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, along with $6.6 billion in total debt, only about $1 billion of which is current (due within the next two years).

Valuation

The GF Value Line indicates Tesla has a fair value of around $1,000 per share, which means the stock is modestly undervalued at the time of writing based on historical ratios, past financial performance and future earnings projections. Tesla Continues to Perform Despite Headwinds

Final thoughts

Tesla is an innovative company with a driven founder who has the incredible ability to execute. Vehicle sales are growing strong and its production is ramping up globally to meet demand. Self-driving technology gives the stock major optionality for the future as it could disrupt the entire transportation industry.

The purchase by Soros really just adds a seal of approval and helps to gauge the valuation.

559,"China Eases, Gazprom to Shut Pipeline, Tesla Price Hike - What's Moving Markets","By Peter Nurse

Investing.com -- China eases monetary policy once more, Europe suffers from more gas supply worries, while an Iranian nuclear deal could be on the verge of being agreed upon, weighing on the price of oil. U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower, and Tesla lifts the price of its advanced driver assistance system. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, August 22.

1. China steps up easing

Beijing is clearly worried about the slowdown in the Chinese economy.

The People’s Bank of China lowered its one-year loan prime rate by 5 basis points to 3.65% at the central bank's monthly fixing on Monday, while the five-year LPR was cut by 15 basis points to 4.30%.

This followed last week’s surprise decision to lower two other benchmark interest rates.

China's economy, the world's second-biggest, narrowly avoided contracting in the second quarter, but widespread COVID-19 lockdowns and a property crisis are weighing heavily on consumer and corporate confidence.

Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs last week cut its full-year GDP growth forecast for China to 3.0% from 3.3% previously, far below Beijing's official target of around 5.5%.

2. Gas stoppage to exacerbate European energy concerns

Europe’s energy woes intensified after Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) announced late Friday it will stop delivering natural gas to Europe through its main pipeline for three days at the end of the month, further squeezing energy supplies.

This resulted in the Dutch front-month gas contract, the European benchmark, soaring 11% higher to 270.98 euros a megawatt-hour, up further from Friday’s record closing high.

The supply of gas through this pipeline has been the subject of much concern for weeks after Gazprom closed the flow down for maintenance work last month. It had subsequently resumed at just 20% of capacity, and European authorities have repeatedly warned of the possibility of a complete shutdown as the Kremlin retaliates for sanctions imposed because of its war in Ukraine.

Story continues

Many European countries, and Germany in particular, are struggling to fill storage sites ahead of winter, and have been urgently seeking out alternative sources of power.

3. Stocks set to drop; Palo Alto, Zoom to report

U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower Monday, with investors nervous ahead of the Federal Reserve’s eagerly-awaited Jackson Hole economic symposium.

By 06:00 ET (10:00 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 300 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 futures were down 1.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.5%.

The main Wall Street indices all closed lower Friday, halting the summer rally on fears that the recent hawkish tone from a number of Fed policymakers will translate into the continuation of more aggressive interest rate hikes, potentially with another 75-basis-point increase in September.

The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped almost 300 points, or 0.9%, on Friday, the broad-based S&P 500 fell 1.3%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed 2% lower.

Fed Chairman Jay Powell is set to speak in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Friday, and investors will be looking for possible answers about how high U.S. interest rates may go and how long they will need to stay at elevated levels to bring inflation back under control.

On a corporate note, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) and Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) are set to report results after the bell Monday, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in the spotlight after lifting the cost of its advanced driver assistance system [see below].

4. Tesla lifts premium driver assistance system price

The price of Tesla’s Full-Self Driving system, its top-level driver assistance program, is set to rise by 25% to $15,000 from $12,000 in September, CEO Elon Musk said, in a tweet on Sunday.

Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system has a feature called “Navigate on Autopilot”, which is intended to let Tesla cars automatically detect and slow down for traffic signs and signals; navigate from highway on-ramp to off-ramp while engaging turn signals; make lane changes and take exits.

Since 2016, the NHTSA has opened 38 probes into collisions, including 19 fatalities, that involved a Tesla vehicle where driver assistance systems including Autopilot and more advanced systems were thought to be a factor.

5. Iran nuclear deal ‘imminent’

Oil prices weakened Monday on reports indicating that a deal reviving a nuclear agreement between Iran and the Western powers was close to being signed off.

Qatar news organization Al Jazeera reported over the weekend that such a deal was ‘imminent’, while the White House confirmed that the leaders of the United States, Britain, France, and Germany discussed the plans over the weekend.

These fraught negotiations have lasted for more than a year and the market may be getting ahead of itself, especially after Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman on Monday accused the United States of ""procrastinating"".

However, an agreement could result in the release of over 1 million barrels of oil per day of supply into the market if the sanctions on Iranian oil are pulled.

By 06:00 ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.6% at $89.84 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 0.75% at $96.27 a barrel.

A group of workers formed Apple Together in 2021 as offices started functioning remotely due to the pandemic. The group circulated a petition internally, demanding ""location flexible work."" Recently, CEO Tim Cook urged employees in and around the Cupertino headquarters to return to the office three days a week from September 5. Cook said he wanted to preserve the ""in-person collaboration that is so essential to our culture."" Cook has insisted on returning since June 2021 while the Covid resurgence delayed his plans. Apple Together urged Apple to allow employees to work with their ""immediate manager"" to decide their working arrangements, with immunity from ""high-level approvals"" and ""complex procedures."" Apple Together looked to collect signatures this week before verifying and sending the results to executives. Silicon Valley companies, including Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) Facebook, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google's engineers worked remotely during the pandemic, including relocation to other parts of the country. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) chief Elon Musk said ""remote work is no longer acceptable,"" threatening workers with termination lest they did not show up. In May, a prominent machine learning computer scientist, Ian Goodfellow, quit Apple for Google sibling DeepMind, reportedly due to Apple's return-to-work policy.

565,Apply Buy-on-the-Dip Strategy in the Near Term: 5 Picks,"Wall Street has enjoyed an impressive bull run for two months after completing a terrible first half of 2022. However, the rally halted on Aug 19 as the three major stock indexes fell sharply. U.S. stock markets may remain volatile in the short term based on a few factors that we will discuss below.

However, each and every dip will be a good opportunity to enter the market to tap mid to long-term gains. We have selected five U.S. bigwigs with a favorable Zacks Rank that are already trading at a deep discount. Further decline in these shares will be a strong entry point. These companies are — Tesla Inc. TSLA, Airbnb Inc. ABNB, Fortinet Inc. FTNT, Oracle Corp. ORCL and Schlumberger Ltd. SLB.

Volatility May Reappear on Wall Street

U.S. stock markets may face volatility in the near term. Market participants remained cautious about the Aug 25-27 scheduled annual Jackson Hole Symposium of the Fed. Although no decision on interest rate hike will be taken in the meeting, the central bank will provide an important indication regarding its near-term policy prescription. This year, policies will be centered  around mounting inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s July FOMC also showed that almost all Fed officials had given consent to a rigorous rate hike until inflation reaches at least close to the central bank’s targeted 2% rate. The consumer price index dropped slightly to 8.5% in July from 9.1% in June. However, in absolute terms, inflation remains highly elevated.

The U.S. GDP contracted in the first two quarters of 2022. Consumer and business spending levels are softening. Our latest estimate suggests that total earnings of the S&P 500 Index will rise 1.9% in third-quarter 2022, implying a sharp fall from 7.2% projected at the beginning of July.

Finally, from mid-June lows to Aug 18, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have rallied 14.7%, 17.8% and 22.7%, respectively. Although these indexes are in negative territory year to date, their recent valuation may result in some profit booking in the near term.

A Buy-on-the-Dip Wall Street

Under the present circumstance, market participants should adopt a “buy-on-the-dip” strategy instead of the “sale-on-the-rise” strategy we saw from mid-January to mid-June. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid.

Despite near-term expected fluctuations, market valuation is unlikely to revert to the mid-June lows. Moreover, the U.S. economy has several future catalysts.

On Aug 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed a $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act. The size of the allotted money may rise up to $737 billion in 10 years. The act has provisions of $390 billion to combat climate change. Per the Biden administration, the most important way to restore a clean climate is to encourage Americans to shift toward electric vehicles.

On Aug 10, 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act that will provide $52.7 billion to microprocessor developers for five years. The Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 37% share in global semiconductor and microchip production in 1990, which drastically dropped to just 12% in 2021.

On Nov 15, 2021,  President Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure act of $550 billion in addition to the previously approved funds of $450 billion for five years. The law aims at establishing the United States with the world's best economic infrastructure. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants currently trading at a deep discount to their 52-week highs. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month. Zacks Investment Research

Tesla has acquired a substantial market share within the electric car segment. Increasing Model 3 delivery, which forms a significant chunk of TSLA’s overall deliveries, is aiding its top line. Along with Model 3, Model Y is contributing to its revenues. The global auto industry is gradually moving toward electric vehicles. Tesla is expected to be the largest beneficiary of this trend.

Despite the chip crisis, Tesla reported strong deliveries of 254,695 units in second-quarter 2022, up 27% year over year. Additionally, TSLA’s energy generation and storage revenues are growing, thanks to the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products.

TSLA has an expected earnings growth rate of 74.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 5.4% over the last 30 days. Tesla is currently trading at a 28.4% discount from its 52-week high.

Airbnb is riding on an improvement in the travel industry. Continued recovery in both longer-distance and cross-border travel owing to a reduction in travel restrictions is benefiting ABNB’s Nights & Experience bookings. Additionally, growth in Average Daily Rates and Gross Booking Value is acting as a tailwind.

Growing active listings in Latin America, North America and EMEA are contributing well to the top-line. Further, growing sales and marketing initiatives along with continuous efforts to upgrade various aspects of the Airbnb service are helping the company gain momentum among hosts and guests.

Airbnb has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 15.8% over the last 30 days. ABNB is currently trading at a 46% discount from its 52-week high.

Fortinet is benefiting from rising demand for security and networking products amid the coronavirus crisis as a huge global workforce is working remotely. FTNT is also benefiting from robust growth in Fortinet Security Fabric, cloud and Software-defined Wide Area Network offerings.

Moreover, continued deal wins, especially those of high value, are solid drivers. Higher IT spending on cybersecurity is further expected to aid Fortinet to grow faster than the security market. Also, focus on enhancing its unified threat management portfolio through product development and acquisitions is a tailwind for FTNT.

Fortinet has an expected earnings growth rate of 30% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 2% over the last 30 days. FTNT is currently trading at a 31% discount from its 52-week high.

Schlumberger is the largest oilfield services player, with a presence in every energy market across the globe. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, SLB is better positioned to take up new offshore projects in international markets.

The significant improvement in oil prices is aiding its overall business. Schlumberger reported strong first-quarter results, driven by strong drilling activities in North America, Latin America and the Middle East. SLB is targeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Schlumberger has an expected earnings growth rate of 57.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 8.6% over the last 30 days. SLB is currently trading at a 25.5% discount from its 52-week high.

Oracle is benefiting from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning, Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management, bodes well.

Solid demand for the Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is anticipated to drive the top line ORCL. Partnerships with Accenture and Microsoft are helping Oracle win new clientele. ORCL’s share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.

Oracle has an expected earnings growth rate of 6.3% for the current year (May 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. ORCL is currently trading at a 26% discount from its 52-week high.

568,Inflation Tesla-style: Elon Musk unveils record price hike for unfinished self-driving software,"Elon Musk is jacking up the price of Tesla’s unfinished autonomous vehicle software yet again, an added feature that itself is starting to approach the cost of a typical small hatchback.

Full Self-Driving (FSD) isn’t just your everyday standard option.

None other than Musk himself believes the stock’s long-term value depends on his massive bet Tesla can be the first to develop and scale robotaxis solely through software upgrades made possible by artificial intelligence.

For that reason, Musk uses a clever mix of psychology and social media to market the feature among its many fans in an attempt to create the impression it is much more popular and more powerful than it may in fact be.

For all customers that have not purchased its prior to Sept. 5, Musk said price will rise by $3,000 to $15,000—his largest hike to date after previous incremental hikes of $1,000 and later $2,000 in the past few years.

The new cost is roughly equivalent to the advertised starting price for a 1.4L Chevrolet Spark with manual transmission and an average transaction price including all features for any subcompact car of $23,220, according to industry data from the Kelley Blue Book.

This time he is aligning the price hike with the wide rollout of his FSD Beta version 10.69.2, which he touted on Sunday as a “big step forward” towards an eventual date in the future when his cars are expected to drive unsupervised.

“The current price will be honored for orders made before Sept. 5, but delivered later,” posted Musk on Sunday.

The hike may be a signal the build constitutes fulfilling his vague pledge this month to shareholders for a “widespread deployment of FSD beta” this year in North America. A wide-scale release may unlock up to $1 billion in deferred software revenue, according to Tesla's latest 10-Q filing.

Demand declining

The announcement, which comes days before investors may take profits on bullish bets placed ahead of Thursday’s three-for-one stock split, is the latest sign of inflation making Tesla less affordable for the broader public. This comes despite his intention to sell 20 million cars annually, or twice as many as industry leader Toyota, by the end of the decade.

Story continues

Previous customers that didn’t purchase the feature with their car are encouraged to buy it now as Tesla has long maintained all cars leaving the factory gate come equipped with a computer powerful enough to operate the software.

“You can upgrade your existing car to FSD in 2 mins via the Tesla app,” Musk added.

Musk has argued that the price hikes are justified as the utility of an autonomous vehicle can be four or five times higher than a conventional one. That's because he claims Teslas will be able to earn passive income for owners by ferrying other passengers around, while other cars without his technology will sit around collecting dust in parking spaces for hours on end.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1182826581070245888?s=20u0026t=TrP5nbTRvM_WYHlKLcATHQ

All things being equal, a price hike is bullish for the stock as it means higher margins. But profit from software sales may drop on an absolute basis if fewer customers decide to buy it.

Survey data from Tesla analyst Troy Teslike estimated the take rate fell to 14% in North America in the first quarter of this year. This represents an almost continuous decline from a peak of 50%-plus in the third quarter of 2019, when the feature still only cost $6,000.

Gamifying the user experience

Normally customers only pay in full for a good when it’s delivered, although an increasing number are now used to getting a product even before that thanks to the emergence of buy-now-pay-later services.

FSD works the other way around. Even though it isn’t ready and may not be for the rest of this year, Tesla customers for years now have been paying full price for it as if it were.

The psychology of FSD beta turns standard practice not just for the auto industry but indeed for any business on its head.

Musk employs delayed gratification to great effect, with customers eagerly looking forward to each new improvement that comes with a software upgrade for a product they already bought—stretching out the purchase experience as owners scour release notes for each change like an Easter egg hunt.

The user experience is also gamified through safety scores. Certain beta testers proudly post to social media when they are among the first to receive an over-the-air upgrade, eliciting envious responses from others still waiting to receive theirs once their safety score is high enough.

https://twitter.com/chazman/status/1561257210453303296?s=20u0026t=HsP5Qf90rBZHOYJ_Ob61Dg

This enthusiasm is all the more remarkable considering the software is not self-driving and drivers are still liable in a crash. Tesla owners must constantly be prepared to intervene at a moment’s notice and seize control should the vehicle suddenly veer from course.

By comparison, rivals argue that the true customer value of self-driving cars can only be unlocked once supervision is no longer required. The only ones capable of that right now are robotaxis like Cruise and Waymo which are not for purchase and still often limited to favorable driving conditions, as liability rests with the company.

'Dangerous and irresponsible'

The method however is coming under fire just as his senior director of AI left the company.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety under the Biden administration has departed from its laissez-faire approach to regulating the technology and recently issued a warning to Tesla that its FSD feature is on probation.

""NHTSA must use its safety recall authority to order that the FSD technology be removed in every Tesla,"" urged veteran consumer safety advocate Ralph Nader earlier this month, calling Musk's planned widespread rollout ""one of the most dangerous and irresponsible actions by a car company in decades.""

https://twitter.com/PatrickMoorhead/status/1561488273993760768?s=20u0026t=TrP5nbTRvM_WYHlKLcATHQ

YouTube later took down videos posted by two social media influencers that involved potentially putting real children in danger as part of a bizarre attempt to prove the system is so advanced it can recognize the difference between kids crossing a street and dummies.

FSD beta isn’t the only part of Tesla business that is currently soaring in price. The brand’s average new car price in the case of an actual transaction (i.e. irrespective of the advertised price that can be materially different) surged 20% in July.

According to the Kelley Blue Book, a new Tesla typically changed hands at $69,255 last month compared with $57,479 in the previous year.

With the industry average gaining only 12% by comparison, it has now vaulted past traditional German premium carmakers Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz—once the benchmark in innovation and quality—when it comes to the price customers are willing to pay.

Add in the new FSD price tag and you’re looking paying at close to $85,000 for your average Tesla.

When it will actually be able to drive on its own without human intervention as a crutch is, however, anyone's guess.

569,"Tesla Raising Price of Driver-Assistance System to $15,000","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. will start charging $15,000 for the driver-assistance system it calls Full Self-Driving, raising the price of the controversial product for the second time this year.

The hike for customers in North America will take effect Sept. 5, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted Sunday. The current $12,000 price will be honored for orders made before that date, he wrote.

Tesla’s Full Self-Driving, or FSD, has been a lightning rod because it requires active supervision and doesn’t make the company’s vehicles autonomous. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles has accused the company of misleading consumers about FSD and its less-capable Autopilot system. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also has opened two separate investigations into whether Autopilot is defective.

Musk, 51, has said solving issues with the company’s self-driving technology is critical to the company’s valuation. “That’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero,” he told fan club members during a recent interview.

Tesla shares fell as much as 2.5% to $867.58 as of 9:40 a.m. Monday in New York. The stock has dropped about 16% this year.

NHTSA sent a letter to Tesla last week regarding the first of its two pending Autopilot defect investigations, posing several questions related to how the company is monitoring and enforcing driver engagement and attentiveness, including its use of in-car cameras. The agency gave the carmaker until Sept. 19 to respond.

The regulator also warned consumers against using real people -- and especially children -- to test Tesla’s safety features after owners posted a video batting back criticism of how capable the company’s cars are at detecting pedestrians. NHTSA’s defect probes have focused on Teslas crashing into stationary first-responder vehicles and suddenly braking at high speeds.

Story continues

Tesla last raised the price of FSD by $2,000 in January. The company said last month that more than 100,000 drivers had access to FSD Beta at the end of the second quarter.

Musk tweeted that a wide release of FSD Beta is one of his two big goals for this year, the other being Space Exploration Technology Corp. getting its massive Starship to orbit. The closely held company has designed the rocket to eventually take humans to Mars.

Credit Suisse Investment Bankers Are Bracing for Brutal Cutbacks Wall Street Bears Take Revenge After a $7 Trillion Rally Stocks Keep Getting Hit as 10-Year Yield Tops 3%: Markets Wrap Powell Has Chance to Reset Market Expectations at Jackson Hole Ukraine Latest: Russian Diplomat Sees No Mediated End to War

Analysts predict the video-conferencing company, which went public in 2019, will report its smallest-ever increase in quarterly revenue late Monday. And Zoom’s shares have missed the big rally in technology stocks since mid-June, dropping 7.8% versus a 17% surge for the Nasdaq 100 Index.

Zoom’s sales exploded during the pandemic as individuals and businesses flocked to video conferencing. Many consumers, though, stuck to the company’s free service, and many businesses that were willing to pay for the offering had, and still have, other options, such as Microsoft Corp.’s Teams. While Zoom is profitable, expectations for its sales growth may still be too high.

“Even if the company guided to more profitability in a more macro constrained environment, a more conservative top-line outlook could cause the name to trade off in the near term,” Meta Marshall, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.

Investors are on edge about the second-quarter earnings. The options market implies they expect a 13% move in either direction for the stock after the report, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Since going public in 2019, the company has beaten revenue and profit estimates every single quarter, but its shares have fallen after six out of the last seven reports, as investors look to see how Zoom will fare in a slower-growth, post-pandemic environment.

Analysts predict that sales increased 9% in the second quarter, down from 12% in the first. For this year and the next two, they estimate 11% to 13% growth, a far cry from the 300%-plus annual surge during the peak of the pandemic.

Story continues

Now that the hyper-growth days are over, Zoom is looking to gain market share among business clients, pitting itself directly against technology giant Microsoft and to a lesser extent Cisco Systems Inc.’s Webex and Salesforce Inc.’s Slack.

Enterprise is “not easy business to win, when you think about Microsoft’s ability to package Teams into an Office 365 sale,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst John Butler said.

“Zoom has shifted its focus to the enterprise segment for growth, where I don’t think their strong brand name will help them as much as it did in the consumer online market,” Butler said.

Analysts are split on the stock, with 14 recommending investors buy and 15 at hold. Citigroup Inc.’s Tyler Radke last week became the lone analyst to rate the stock a sell.

He sees more competition from Microsoft Teams and also expects smaller mom-and-pop businesses to cut back on less critical expenditures as inflation squeezes their budgets.

“There’s so much competition here now,” said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure and a proprietary trader at Bright Trading. Everyone’s asking, “the earnings are OK here at Zoom, but are they sustainable?”

Amazon.com Inc. is closing in on Alphabet Inc.’s market capitalization. The e-commerce giant slipped behind Google’s owner in July last year and now ranks fourth in size, behind Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet.

INES FERRE: And Brad, stocks continuing to sell off from last Friday. Take a look at the NASDAQ. It's down 1.7%. Do want to point out the 10-year Treasury note yield that is pushing up towards 3%.

Also want to point out the US dollar index at 108.67. Remember that we've seen this before. When that dollar goes higher, we are seeing stocks that tend to go lower. So let's take a look under the hood.

We're watching consumer discretionary. Energy stocks, these are losing the most right now. Consumer discretionary, a lot of this has to do with Amazon, down more than 3%, Tesla down almost 3% as well. Do want to point out Netflix down 5% after a downgrade at CFRA.

Also want to point out the semiconductors. These are seeing weakness. Citi came out with a warning about memory chips and pricing weakness going forward there. So we are seeing a little bit of a pullback there.

Want to mention the energy stocks, because we had seen that this is one of the biggest decliners. So a pullback with some of these names. But also, when we take a look at WTI, Brent Crude, just want to mention that we're watching Brent down more than 2% the last time that I checked.

Oh, 4% right now. And we are looking at WTI extending its losses down more than 4% as well for WTI. Just want to mention also though, natural gas hitting another 14-year high, guys.

JULIE HYMAN: Interesting. And that's also as we watch what's going on in Iran, that affecting the price of oil. Natural gas closely tied to Russia and what's going on in Europe. So a lot moving. Thank you so much on the energy front.",2022-08-22T14:46:50+00:00,2022-08-22
576,Tesla loses challenge to California agency suing for race bias,"By Daniel Wiessner

(Reuters) - A California administrative agency has declined to review Tesla Inc's claim that the state's civil rights watchdog suing the company for race bias at an assembly plant is rushing to sue businesses without conducting full investigations.

California's Office of Administrative Law in a letter denied Tesla's petition, filed in June, to determine whether the Department of Civil Rights (DCR) had adopted ""underground regulations"" that flout requirements it must meet before suing employers.

The letter obtained by Reuters is dated August 8 but was received by the department last week.

The OAL, which reviews state agency regulations and can recommend changes, said its decision in no way reflects the merits of Tesla's complaint.

The department in a pending lawsuit filed in February says Tesla's flagship Fremont, California, plant was a racially segregated workplace where Black employees were harassed and discriminated against in terms of job assignments, discipline and pay.

A representative of Tesla, which has denied wrongdoing in the race bias case, had no immediate comment.

A spokesperson for the DCR did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency was called the Department of Fair Employment and Housing before changing its name last month.

Tesla's petition with the OAL was an attempt to rein in the department's authority to pursue discrimination cases by forcing it to take additional steps before suing, such as providing businesses with detailed explanations of alleged legal violations and making efforts to settle outside of court.

In the pending lawsuit, Tesla has argued that the DCR sued without first notifying the company of all of the claims or giving it a chance to settle.

A California state judge is scheduled to hold a hearing on Wednesday on Tesla's motion to dismiss the case.

The lawsuit is one of several pending in California courts that accuse Tesla of tolerating discrimination and sexual harassment at its factories.

A state judge in April cut a jury verdict for a Black worker who alleged racial harassment from $137 million to $15 million. The worker, Owen Diaz, rejected the reduced award and opted for a new trial, which is scheduled for March 2023.

577,"Tesla, DocuSign, Coupa, Salesforce stocks on the move after Wall Street ratings","Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss how Tesla, DocuSign, Coupa, and Salesforce stocks are trading after Wall Street ratings.

Video Transcript

JULIE HYMAN: We're taking a look at some Calls of the Day Right now. Starting with DocuSign and Coupa Software, RBC is warning that a weaker macro picture will affect software earnings. It's slashing its rating on DocuSign to sector perform from outperform. And Coupa Software is going to under-perform from sector perform. What's interesting here on DocuSign in particular is that, of course, it has been an under-performer.

I guess RBC was coming in here and saying, well, maybe it's fallen enough to buy. But now, not doing that, saying now is not the time to get in here. Weak bookings may take time to show up in revenue or in billings, according to the RBC analyst. And Coupa, according to RBC, looks disproportionately recession-prone compared to its peers, which is not something you want to be in this environment, Souz.

BRIAN SOZZI: No, not at all, Julie. You are, in fact, correct. But DocuSign, I'm a little concerned about the near-term outlook for DocuSign. But again, this Coupa call comes ahead of Salesforce's earnings later this week-- a lot of eyes on that report. And if they, in fact, saw a slowdown in backlog, I think a lot of the notes out this morning are a little concerned on that-- not surprised to see this call.

BRAD SMITH: And with DocuSign, even as we're taking a look at that longer term period, this chart for the one-year period, seeing them down by about 78%, there is so much of what we continue to talk about, that pull forward in demand that happened early days of the pandemic. And even after this company had going public, there was a larger question of once they hit the total addressable market and you enter in the competition as well, account for that, the number of different solutions where DocuSign is going to need to rely on the partnerships that they've been able to create to even address some of those portfolio clients that they may not have.

Story continues

But because of their plug-in that they allow to so many of their-- well, Adobe can have their own plug-in. But Microsoft, where DocuSign had really netted one of those key partnerships, to allow them access into a portfolio client base much larger than their own, once they've actually fully tapped that, then where else does the growth come from? And that's a significant headwind that they continue to face even right now, Sozz.

BRIAN SOZZI: All right, let's stay on tech here. My call today is Tesla. I'm looking at Garrett Nelson over at CFRA, lifting his 12-month price target to $1,245 from $1,125. You do that rough math. He's looking for about 42% upside in Tesla shares from current levels. We mentioned this at the top of the show when we were talking about Tesla.

But according to Nelson, the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act was the equivalent of, quote, ""Christmas in August"" for Elon Musk. So the basic call is this. You could probably see an acceleration in Tesla profits in coming quarters. At least that's the vibe I got from Nelson's note, as more people get out there and buy electric cars because of this tax credit.

JULIE HYMAN: I mean, you have to wonder, though, about all of these sort of exogenous factors that are affecting Tesla, everything from the NHTSA investigation into Autopilot that we talked about earlier, to Elon Musk's court battle over Twitter, and kind of what effect that that is going to have on the company. But I don't know how you model that stuff as an analyst, really.

BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and it really continues to come back to, not just Tesla and how any of the price hikes that they've already started to institute or those that they've signaled, whether it's on individual features or the total cost of the car, it's going to be the manufacturing and the raw materials, and ensuring that those raw materials costs don't continue to tick up because suppliers know what the environment is right now. They know exactly what type of demand that they're seeing.

And so the long term contracts come into play as you're seeing even more of the automotive landscape get more competitive around their electric vehicle plays, Ford, GM, and then even internationally, when you see some of the Mercedes-Benz's-- well, the Mercedes-Benz brand more internationally, or Volkswagen, all of those with the EV plays that are moving forward, they also have a customer base that has been prone to say trade in and trade up.

And so that's perhaps where they're going to lean into their strategy there. And we'll see exactly what that means for Tesla. But the battery, it's going to come back to that. So as long as the battery is better, perhaps they'll get more mileage for the consumers there.",2022-08-22T14:52:45+00:00,2022-08-22

By Joseph White

Aug 22 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said it will cut a total of 3,000 salaried and contract jobs, mostly in North America and India, as it restructures to catch up with Tesla Inc in the race to develop software-driven electric vehicles.

Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley has been saying for months that he believed the Dearborn, Mich. automaker had too many people, and that not enough of its workforce had the skills required as the auto industry shifts to electric vehicles and digital services.

""We are eliminating work, as well as reorganizing and simplifying functions throughout the business. You will hear more specifics from the leaders of your area of the business later this week,"" Farley and Ford Chairman Bill Ford wrote in a joint email.

Ford shares were down 4.8% in midday trading amid broader declines on Wall Street.

Like other established automakers, Ford has a workforce largely hired to support a traditional combustion technology product lineup. Going forward, Farley has mapped out a strategy for Ford to develop a broad lineup of electric vehicles. Like Tesla, Ford wants to generate more revenue through services that depend on digital software and connectivity.

Tesla's pre-tax profit margins have exceeded Ford's this year, and Farley has been blunt about the need to cut costs.

In Monday's email to staff, Farley and Ford said the company's cost structure ""is uncompetitive versus traditional and new competitors.""

Rising prices for batteries, raw materials and shipping are putting additional pressure on Ford and other automakers. Still, Ford has stuck to its full-year profit forecast, despite $3 billion in higher costs due to inflation.

Ford has begun separating its operations into electric, combustion engine and commercial vehicle operations. Farley said in July ""cost reduction will happen"" in the combustion operations. But Ford said on Monday the staff cuts will affect all parts of the company.

Story continues

Rival General Motors Co in late 2018 moved to cut 14,000 jobs as it prepared to accelerate its electric vehicle strategy.

Ford, GM and Stellantis' North American operations will confront a new workforce challenge next year as they begin contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union, which represents the Detroit automakers' U.S. factory employees.

UAW leaders have expressed concern that electric vehicles will mean fewer manufacturing jobs, and more jobs dispersed to non-union battery and EV hardware factories. (Editing by Bernadette Baum)",2022-08-22T15:41:56+00:00,2022-08-22
581,7 Stocks to Buy This Week,"The stocks to buy this week relate to major news items that occurred relatively recently. As well, they take into consideration prior price action. Therefore, I steered clear of obvious meme trades. While speculating on short squeezes or other contrarian events draws excitement, it tends to be very unpredictable.

Nevertheless, these companies merely represent ideas that could swing higher in the near term. The goal is more toward bringing compelling opportunities to the table with a reasonably long shelf life.

With that out of the way, here are seven stocks to buy this week.

Perhaps the most obvious idea for stocks to buy this week is Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). That’s because on Friday, Aug. 19, Warren Buffett via his company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of oil firm Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).

CNBC noted that Berkshire dramatically increased its stake in Occidental. Naturally, OXY shot up just a hair under double-digit territory on Friday. On a year-to-date basis, the security is up 140%. However, chasing OXY might not be the wisest idea for stocks to buy this week.

And that brings us back to Exxon Mobil. The idea here is to ride Occidental’s coattails. While no major breaking news hit Exxon, the bigger takeaway is that the Oracle of Omaha sees upside in hydrocarbons.

Moreover, XOM presents a fairly valued (if not undervalued) investment. The company features robust strengths in the balance sheet and very solid profitability metrics. In contrast, Gurufocus.com considers OXY significantly overvalued.

Based on recent developments, the inclusion of employment services agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) might appear strange. After all, the latest jobs report for July produced outstanding results. Indeed, the number of employment opportunities added to the economy exceeded expectations. However, not all is well.

Primarily, investors should note that the labor force participation rate for workers aged 25 to 54 years has been flat since March of this year. That’s an oddity if the labor force is holistically rebounding. More significantly, good jobs have begun fading into the background. Recently, I drew attention to seven technology firms forced to conduct layoffs.

In particular, tech-driven real-estate brokerage firm Compass (NYSE:COMP) draws major red flags. A few months ago, it announced that it will cut about 10% of its workforce. More recently, management stated that more layoffs will occur by October.

So yes, the jobs report stunned everyone. However, the prospects for good jobs present significant ambiguities. That’s why I’ll bet that RHI is one of the stocks to buy this week.

Hagerty (HGTY) Used car market: a row of cars of different makes and models sitting on a lot.

Specializing in insurance products for classic cars, Hagerty (NYSE:HGTY) broadly benefits from recent fundamental developments. Mainly, equities slipped on Friday because “St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard indicated that the central bank would likely continue hiking rates in the near term,” per CNBC.

Naturally, higher rates equate to higher borrowing costs, reducing incentives for growth-oriented businesses. However, not all companies feel the same about higher rates. Specifically, insurance firms tend to have a direct correlation with rates. Basically, as rates go up, so too does the valuation of insurance companies.

However, that’s not necessarily the reason why I bring up HGTY as one of the stocks to buy this week. Rather, the underlying company caters to a wealthier clientele. In addition to insuring classic cars, it also covers boats, motorcycles and other rich people’s toys.

Not everyone will feel the impact of a potential recession at the same time. In a way, then, Hagerty provides some margin of safety.

KeyCorp (KEY) KeyBank storefront logo

Considering that Friday’s main talking point on Wall Street centered on the trajectory of the benchmark interest rate, it’s a good time to bring up KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY). KeyCorp’s primary subsidiary is KeyBank, a regional bank headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. This fact may be significant for two reasons.

First, as a general discussion, regional banks may present a safer option than big banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). As the title suggests, regional firms tend to focus on regional concerns. Therefore, these localized enterprises theoretically feature insulation from international headwinds that could impact a JPMorgan.

Second, multiple reports indicate that millennials have migrated to the Midwest. Many have even relocated to smaller Midwestern cities. Naturally, this dynamic boosts KeyCorp and its main subsidiary due to its Midwestern focus and roots.

As well, KEY may be one of the stocks to buy this week for interest-rate insulation. Essentially, as rates rise, this movement translates to higher profitability for KeyCorp. Still, be aware that aggressively accelerating rates work in the opposite direction.

LendingClub (LC)

Despite the July jobs report presenting an optimistic picture of the economy, it might not be capturing important nuances. As mentioned above, tech layoffs have accelerated this year. The problem with this dynamic is that tech jobs typically pay higher-than-average salaries. Therefore, the nominal labor market report may be hiding significant pain.

Cynically, this matter segues into a discussion for LendingClub (NYSE:LC). A financial services firm, LendingClub specializes in online personal loans up to $40,000. As the multi-decade highs in inflation crimp household spending (and savings), many folks may turn to the fintech company. Basically, you got to do what you can to make ends meet.

Investors must appreciate the widescale suffering that has materialized. In 2021, the purchasing power of the dollar declined 6%. Just in the first half of this year, the erosion measured 5.3%. Now, the Fed committed to an aggressively hawkish monetary policy to provide course correction. But that action would then pressure economic health overall.

Therefore, LC may be one of the stocks to buy this week, just out of sheer necessity.

Again diving into the cynical nature of stocks to buy this week, investors should tune into Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). As I write this, CNBC has been providing breaking news about Russia’s control of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Europe’s largest nuclear facility, any incident there could spell catastrophe for the region.

Additionally, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan sparked anger in China. The issue here also presents great risks.

About the only good news in this whole mess comes down to the performance of certain military contractors. Primarily, Lockheed has bolstered the Ukrainian resistance, in large part to the company’s High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).

Admittedly, LMT represents a controversial name among stocks to buy this week. However, it’s still very much relevant.

EVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station

For the most speculative name on this list of stocks to buy this week, contrarian investors may consider EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO). Billed as America’s largest public electric vehicle fast charging network, EVgo brings necessary infrastructure to the table. Fundamentally, EVGO benefits from the fact that not everyone has access to personal charging mechanisms.

While 63% of all housing units feature a garage or carport, this figure leaves many millions of units which don’t. Therefore, EVgo fills an opportunity gap. However, the market hasn’t been that kind to EVGO stock, with shares moving sideways since its public market debut.

Of course, part of the problem is that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) plans to open its Supercharger network to all EV owners. Further, EVs themselves have gotten very expensive, thus pricing out many consumers.

However, JPMorgan mentioned that EVGO represented one of the securities to buy as a derivative play on the EV rollout. With shares starting to come back down to the price when JPM mentioned its bullishness, EVGO certainly provides intrigue.

583,"Tesla stock is 40% undervalued after Inflation Reduction Act signing, analyst argues","The Inflation Reduction Act's new $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles could be a major tailwind to Tesla stock and the company's bottom line, contends CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson.

""The signing of the Inflation Reduction Act was the equivalent of 'Christmas in August' for Elon Musk & Co., as we peg Tesla as the biggest winner from the new law, as most versions of the industry's two bestselling EVs (Tesla's Model Y and Model 3) become eligible for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit effective January 1, 2023,"" Nelson wrote in a note to clients. ""Previously, all Tesla vehicles had phased out of tax credit eligibility after hitting the 200K units per manufacturer cap.""

Nelson lifted his price target on Tesla's stock to $1,245 from $1,125, which now assumes a 43% upside from current trading levels. Tesla's stock is Nelson's top pick from the auto sector.

The Inflation Reduction Act serves up a $7,500 tax credit to consumers for EVs priced up to $80,000 for trucks and $55,000 for cars. To qualify for the tax credit, buyers must earn less than $150,000 in household income if single or $300,000 as a household if married. The tax credit applies only to EVs assembled in North America.

Tesla's Model 3 and Y will find competition in 2023 for those looking to buy EVs due to the new tax credit. The base price for the Ford Mach-E crossover is around $43,000. GM's Chevy Bolt starts at about $38,000. Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks at the Tesla Giga Texas manufacturing ""Cyber Rodeo"" grand opening party on April 7, 2022 in Austin, Texas. (Photo by SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images)

Nelson thinks Tesla will be further aided by the Inflation Reduction Act's price stipulation meaning consumers may not purchase higher end models without a tax credit. Some of those more expensive offerings could come from the likes of Lucid, Polestar, and Mercedes.

""Moreover, the new law significantly alleviates concerns about EV competition, as roughly 70% of the 72 EV models currently for sale in the U.S. suddenly became ineligible for the tax credit under the new law,"" Nelson added.

587,5 Cathie Wood Stocks Signaling “The Bear Market Is Over”,"This article is excerpted from Tom Yeung’s Profit & Protection newsletter dated Aug. 16, 2022. To make sure you don’t miss any of Tom’s picks, subscribe to his mailing list here.

When I recommended shares of CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) and Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BEAM) in July, biotech’s future seemed dim at best. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had just raised rates by 75 basis points the month before, and the age of easy money seemed to be long gone. Shares of CRISPR and Beam had both fallen two-thirds from their peak.

These top Cathie Wood holdings — along with Ginkgo Bioworks (NYSE:DNA) — are the stock market’s canaries in the coalmine. Because profits of these biotech firms are many years into the future, analysts must “discount” those earnings a longer way back to the present.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

To borrow a term from the fixed income world, these Cathie Wood picks are “long duration” stocks.

For equity investors, these long-duration stocks matter. That’s because these companies are some of the earliest-warning signals in the ARK Invest portfolio – shares of BEAM peaked in July 2021, around five months before the Nasdaq hit its all-time high. And all three bottomed out in May, a month earlier than the Nasdaq index’s trough. It’s one of the closest thing that equity investors have to a crystal ball.

Today, these stocks are telling a new story. Since I recommended the stocks, shares of CRISPR have stabilized in the $70-$80 range, while Beam has risen 33%. Even Ginkgo Bioworks — a moonshot bet that loses $3.50 for every dollar generated – has rebounded into the mid-$3 range. The company now scores an A+ for its Profit & Protection momentum score.

Two More of Cathie Wood’s Canaries

Two other Cathie Wood stocks are also pointing to a return of better times.

DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG). The online sports betting platform peaked in March 2021, nine months before the Nasdaq top. The 70% recovery of this consumer discretionary stock points to a a greater willingness by investors to take leaps of faith. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM). Cathie Wood’s No. 2 holding peaked over a year before the Nasdaq did. Shares have stabilized since March.

Story continues

These stocks represent early peaking companies. DraftKings is one of Cathie Wood’s few consumer discretionary stocks – a sector that typically outperforms in early stage recessions, according to research from Fidelity Investments. And Zoom was an early beneficiary of the work-from-home movement that fell after the initial rush subsided.

And in each of these cases, shares of early peaking stocks have stopped falling for at least three months.

That’s essential. The Profit & Protection system finds that momentum effects start to take hold around the three-month mark (and peaks at the 12-month one). Over the past decade, investors buying shares in the quintile of top-performing stocks from the past-three months can outperform by a small margin. A chart showing 3-month momentum predictions

In other words, the early warning stocks of Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest are now suggesting the road to recover has finally begun.

1 Cathie Wood Stock Warning About More Losses to Come

Yet, not every Cathie Wood stock is signaling that the depths of investor despair have passed. And one in particular is still warning of more potential drawdowns.

That stock is ARK Invests’ No. 1 holding:

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Shares of the electric vehicle firm have defied gravity, just as how its CEO has defied security and safety regulators. TSLA shares trade only a quarter off their all-time high, despite mounting concerns over its shoot-now-ask-questions-later strategy.

“Investors might believe there is some risk from Tesla’s aggressive approach to FSD development,” Al Root of Barron’s noted, “But for now, they’re focused more on sales growth and margins.”

These are major causes for concern. In cases such as Cathie Wood’s biotech picks, these shares needed to come crashing to earth before becoming attractive to the Profit & Protection stock selection system. Only when markets have fully given up is it time to start picking up the scraps.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s valuation has remained elevated. Shares trade for 70x forward earnings and are worth more than the next 14 automakers combined. On a price/sales basis, it’s more expensive than tech firms like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), firms with a far better return on capital invested profile. By my estimate, shares could fall 50% and still look pricey. A chart showing Tesla (TSLA) stock price data

What Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest Is Saying to Do Next

There’s nothing new to the stock market’s many personalities.

Energy stocks… Gold… Commodities…

These alternative investments have always provided some measure of diversification.

But sometimes, the market throws a wrench into the works. Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) rose to unbelievable levels in 2021 after meme stock traders jumped in.

And just as companies can overshoot their valuations, they can also undershoot on the way down. Shares of Desktop Metal (NYSE:DM) and RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) remain top Profit & Protection picks for their rock-bottom prices.

Today, many of Cathie Wood’s “long-duration” picks are suggesting that the worst of the bear market is finally behind us; investors should expect a long, slow climb as the Fed starts relaxing monetary policy in 2023.

But investors shouldn’t rush out and buy everything all at once. The Nasdaq Index rebounded 32% in Q4 2001, only to drop another 32% again the following year. And as Tesla’s elevated valuation tells us, the price of highly valued stocks can still fall right back down.

589,Elon Musk demands Jack Dorsey turn over Twitter info on fake accounts,"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is asking Twitter (TWTR) co-founder Jack Dorsey to hand over documents tied to a legal fight that will determine whether Musk will have to buy the social media company for $44 billion.

On Monday, attorneys for Musk filed court documents showing they had issued a subpoena requiring Dorsey to share documents on Twitter's fake accounts, an issue at the heart of Musk's rationale for backing out of the $44 billion agreement to acquire the company.

In the filing, Musk's lawyers ask for any documents or communications Dorsey has relating to ""monetizable daily active users"" or mDAU — a key metric in the fight between Musk and Twitter. Musk tried to terminate the deal on the grounds that he suspected Twitter suffered from a higher prevalence of fake accounts than the less than 5% of its mDAUs that it reported. Twitter sued Musk in an attempt to force the deal, contending that his purported concern over fake accounts was a pretext for backing out.

Dorsey Schedules a & B by Erin Fuchs on Scribd

According to Musk, Twitter failed to turn over enough information about its fake accounts, also known as spam or spam bot accounts, and may have misrepresented the prevalence of those accounts in its regulatory filings. His lawyers characterize the bot data ""fundamental to Twitter’s business and financial performance"" and necessary to complete the deal.

Twitter says it accurately stated those figures and was not required under the merger agreement to supply Musk with any additional details.

Specifically, Musk is asking Dorsey, Twitter's former CEO, to turn over documents and communications concerning the effects of false or spam accounts on Twitter’s business and operations.

The crypto conference is expected to draw 50,000 people and runs from Friday, June 4 through June 6th. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

The Tesla CEO asks for more information related to Twitter’s use of mDAU as one of its “Key Metrics"" in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That could include information connected to the relationship between mDAU and Twitter’s present and future revenue projections, and information explaining any ties between mDAU and executive or director compensation.

Story continues

While Musk's skepticism over mDAU numbers has been the focus of his defense and a counterclaim filed against Twitter, his lawyers also seek to have Dorsey disclose any documents and communications related to Twitter’s use of other metrics, such as daily active users, monthly active users, daily user engagement, monthly user engagement, and advertisement engagements.

Musk's lawyers further target any methods that Twitter has used to detect and label accounts as spam or false.

Unless Twitter and Musk settle their dispute, the Delaware Chancery Court’s chief judge, Kathaleen McCormick, will be left to interpret the contract. A trial is set to begin Oct. 17.

Dorsey, who stepped down as Twitter’s chief executive officer last year, has been an energetic booster of Musk’s bid for the company, tweeting in April that Musk was the “singular solution I trust” to take over.

The subpoena follows a pair filed Friday for Kayvon Beykpour, former head of consumer product at Twitter, and Bruce Falck, formerly in charge of revenue product. The billionaire is rapidly marshaling documents and data to show that Twitter understated how much of its customer base is made up of spam and robot accounts.

Since the world’s richest person retreated from the purchase, dozens of people, banks and funds have been subpoenaed by both sides in the legal fight playing out in Delaware. The push to gather information and interview important figures in the deal comes ahead of an expedited schedule for the trial, slated to begin Oct. 17 and last five days.

Musk’s decision to subpoena Dorsey, who served two stints as CEO, is an interesting one given the duo’s history. The two executives, both big Bitcoin supporters, have been friendly for years. Dorsey has praised Musk, describing him as a favorite influential tweeter, and invited him to Twitter to discuss product ideas.

In a Rolling Stone interview in early 2019, Dorsey said he “loved” Musk and what he was trying to do with Tesla Inc. and SpaceX. Musk even appeared at Twitter’s companywide retreat in early 2020 to speak with employees by videochat -- during which he complained about Twitter’s bot problem.

Story continues

More recently, the two have advocated for making Twitter’s software and content moderation decisions more transparent. After Musk became Twitter’s largest shareholder in late March, Dorsey was the first person at the company he called, according to a regulatory filing. Dorsey, who was still a Twitter director at the time, later encouraged Musk to join the board and spoke glowingly of him after the board agreed to sell Musk the company.

Earlier this month, the Tesla CEO accused Twitter of hiding the names of workers specifically responsible for evaluating the proportion of spam and robot accounts. Musk argues the company has failed to show that they make up fewer than 5% of its active users, as it has said in regulatory filings.

Twitter says it’s all a show to justify walking away from the deal.

Dorsey and Musk have their differences. Under Dorsey, Twitter permanently banned former president Donald Trump after the Capitol riot, although Dorsey delegated most of the moderation decisions to his legal deputy and later publicly questioned the ban. Musk has said he opposes “permanent bans” and would bring Trump back if he buys Twitter, although he hasn’t articulated a comprehensive content policy philosophy.

Dorsey stepped down as Twitter CEO to focus on Block Inc., his payments processing company.

Read More: Musk Says Twitter Is Hounding Him Over Every Chat About Buyout

Beykpour, the former head of consumer product, was the top product executive at Twitter for years before he was unexpectedly dismissed by new chief executive officer Parag Agrawal. It was his team that was most directly responsible for expanding Twitter’s user base -- and it is the quality of that base Musk has questioned in seeking to escape from the acquisition.

Beykpour joined Twitter in 2015 when the company acquired his live video app, Periscope, and quickly climbed the ranks under Dorsey. He was pushing Twitter into new product areas, like live audio spaces and newsletters, before he was ousted.

The departures of Beykpour and Falck reflected Twitter’s state of limbo while it awaited a new owner, a state now intensified by the litigation. Meanwhile a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting efforts have left some employees unsure of whether the projects or teams they are working on will be prioritized under new leadership.

The case is Twitter v. Musk, 22-0613, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla Inc. TSLA, Airbnb Inc.

Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:

Apply ""Buy the Dip"" Strategy for the Near-Term: 5 Picks

Wall Street has enjoyed an impressive bull run for two months after completing a terrible first half of 2022. However, the rally halted on Aug 19 as the three major stock indexes fell sharply. U.S. stock markets may remain volatile in the short term based on a few factors that we will discuss below.

However, each and every dip will be a good opportunity to enter the market to tap mid to long-term gains. We have selected five U.S. bigwigs with a favorable Zacks Rank that are already trading at a deep discount. Further decline in these shares will be a strong entry point. These companies are — Tesla Inc., Airbnb Inc., Fortinet Inc., Oracle Corp. and Schlumberger Ltd.

Volatility May Reappear on Wall Street

U.S. stock markets may face volatility in the near term. Market participants remained cautious about the Aug 25-27 scheduled annual Jackson Hole Symposium of the Fed. Although no decision on interest rate hike will be taken in the meeting, the central bank will provide an important indication regarding its near-term policy prescription. This year, policies will be centered  around mounting inflation.

Minutes of the Fed’s July FOMC also showed that almost all Fed officials had given consent to a rigorous rate hike until inflation reaches at least close to the central bank’s targeted 2% rate. The consumer price index dropped slightly to 8.5% in July from 9.1% in June. However, in absolute terms, inflation remains highly elevated.

Story continues

The U.S. GDP contracted in the first two quarters of 2022. Consumer and business spending levels are softening. Our latest estimate suggests that total earnings of the S&P 500 Index will rise 1.9% in third-quarter 2022, implying a sharp fall from 7.2% projected at the beginning of July.

Finally, from mid-June lows to Aug 18, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have rallied 14.7%, 17.8% and 22.7%, respectively. Although these indexes are in negative territory year to date, their recent valuation may result in some profit booking in the near term.

A Buy-on-the-Dip Wall Street

Under the present circumstance, market participants should adopt a “buy-on-the-dip” strategy instead of the “sale-on-the-rise” strategy we saw from mid-January to mid-June. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid.

Despite near-term expected fluctuations, market valuation is unlikely to revert to the mid-June lows. Moreover, the U.S. economy has several future catalysts.

On Aug 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed a $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act. The size of the allotted money may rise up to $737 billion in 10 years. The act has provisions of $390 billion to combat climate change. Per the Biden administration, the most important way to restore a clean climate is to encourage Americans to shift toward electric vehicles.

On Aug 10, 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act that will provide $52.7 billion to microprocessor developers for five years. The Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 37% share in global semiconductor and microchip production in 1990, which drastically dropped to just 12% in 2021.

On Nov 15, 2021,  President Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure act of $550 billion in addition to the previously approved funds of $450 billion for five years. The law aims at establishing the United States with the world's best economic infrastructure. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants currently trading at a deep discount to their 52-week highs. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Teslahas acquired a substantial market share within the electric car segment. Increasing Model 3 delivery, which forms a significant chunk of TSLA’s overall deliveries, is aiding its top line. Along with Model 3, Model Y is contributing to its revenues. The global auto industry is gradually moving toward electric vehicles. Tesla is expected to be the largest beneficiary of this trend.

Despite the chip crisis, Tesla reported strong deliveries of 254,695 units in second-quarter 2022, up 27% year over year. Additionally, TSLA’s energy generation and storage revenues are growing, thanks to the positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products.

TSLA has an expected earnings growth rate of 74.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 5.4% over the last 30 days. Tesla is currently trading at a 28.4% discount from its 52-week high.

Airbnb is riding on an improvement in the travel industry. Continued recovery in both longer-distance and cross-border travel owing to a reduction in travel restrictions is benefiting ABNB’s Nights & Experience bookings. Additionally, growth in Average Daily Rates and Gross Booking Value is acting as a tailwind.

Growing active listings in Latin America, North America and EMEA are contributing well to the top-line. Further, growing sales and marketing initiatives along with continuous efforts to upgrade various aspects of the Airbnb service are helping the company gain momentum among hosts and guests.

Airbnb has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 15.8% over the last 30 days. ABNB is currently trading at a 46% discount from its 52-week high.

Fortinet is benefiting from rising demand for security and networking products amid the coronavirus crisis as a huge global workforce is working remotely. FTNT is also benefiting from robust growth in Fortinet Security Fabric, cloud and Software-defined Wide Area Network offerings.

Moreover, continued deal wins, especially those of high value, are solid drivers. Higher IT spending on cybersecurity is further expected to aid Fortinet to grow faster than the security market. Also, focus on enhancing its unified threat management portfolio through product development and acquisitions is a tailwind for FTNT.

Fortinet has an expected earnings growth rate of 30% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 2% over the last 30 days. FTNT is currently trading at a 31% discount from its 52-week high.

Schlumberger is the largest oilfield services player, with a presence in every energy market across the globe. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, SLB is better positioned to take up new offshore projects in international markets.

The significant improvement in oil prices is aiding its overall business. Schlumberger reported strong first-quarter results, driven by strong drilling activities in North America, Latin America and the Middle East. SLB is targeting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Schlumberger has an expected earnings growth rate of 57.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 8.6% over the last 30 days. SLB is currently trading at a 25.5% discount from its 52-week high.

Oracle is benefiting from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning, Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management, bodes well.

Solid demand for the Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is anticipated to drive the top line ORCL. Partnerships with Accenture and Microsoft are helping Oracle win new clientele. ORCL’s share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.

Oracle has an expected earnings growth rate of 6.3% for the current year (May 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. ORCL is currently trading at a 26% discount from its 52-week high.

599,5 Top Stocks Likely to Beat Earnings Estimates,"It is not surprising that before an earnings season, each investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.

The screener yields winning stocks like Target Hospitality TH, Ulta Beauty ULTA, Tesla TSLA, Albemarle ALB and CommScope COMM.

Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?

Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.

Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.

Meanwhile, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.

Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.

How to Find Stocks That Can Beat?

Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.

An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.

Story continues

The Winning Strategy

In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.

Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.

Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.

Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.

In addition, we place a few other criteria that raise the chance of a positive surprise.

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.

Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat, per our proven model.

In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:

Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.

Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.

A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 12.

Here are five out of 12 stocks:

Target Hospitality TH:Target Hospitality Corp. is the holding company for Target Lodging, Signor Lodging and their respective subsidiaries. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The average earnings surprise of TH for the past four quarters is 135.50%.

Ulta Beauty ULTA: Ulta Beauty Inc., previously known as Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., is a leading beauty retailer in the United States. Founded in 1990, the company changed its name to Ulta Beauty in January 2017. It has a Zacks Rank #2.

The average earnings surprise of ULTA for the past four quarters is 49.84%.

Tesla TSLA: Over the years, EV maker Tesla has evolved into a dynamic technology innovator. It has a Zacks Rank #2.

The average earnings surprise of TSLAfor the past four quarters is 32.17%.

Albemarle ALB: Albemarle Corporation is a premier specialty chemicals company with leading positions in attractive end markets globally. It has a Zacks Rank #1.

The average earnings surprise of ALB for the past four quarters is 24.16%.

CommScope COMM: CommScope Holding Company, Inc. is a premier provider of infrastructure solutions, including wireless and fiber optic solutions, for the core, access and edge layers of communication networks. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2.

The average earnings surprise of COMM for the past four quarters is 16.20%.

600,7 Top-Rated Large-Cap Stocks to Buy and Hold,"Top-rated large-cap stocks can offer a bit of security in volatile times.

After the relief rally earlier this month, stocks may be in for another bout of weakness. Uncertainties like inflation, rising interest rates and a potential recession have still yet to be fully absorbed by the market. That may be a discouraging prospect for anyone looking for short-term opportunities.

But if you invest in top-rated large-cap stocks with a long time horizon, further market volatility may work in your favor. Just as a bull market typically pushes both high-quality and low-quality stocks to higher prices, the opposite is true for a market downturn.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

While pushing down more speculative plays to prices more reflective of their fundamentals, the market can also push top-rated large-cap stocks to very favorable price points for “buy and hold” investors.

That’s the case here with the seven top-rated large-cap stocks listed below. Each one earns either an “A” or “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader. Consider entering/add to positions in them, as choppy waters remain for the market.

ABBV AbbVie $140.34 ELV Elevance Health $507.00 GD General Dynamics $234.49 KO Coca-Cola $64.20 TSLA Tesla $869.74 UNH UnitedHealth Group $544.57 XOM ExxonMobil $94.01

As a major pharmaceutical company, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a great recession-resistant stock to include in any portfolio. A downturn could dampen demand for many sectors, yet people need healthcare, even in a recession.

That said, I can see why there may be some reservations about buying ABBV stock today. Between losing exclusivity for its Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug and news of it paying more than $2 billion to resolve opioid litigation, it may seem as if it has too many headwinds right now.

However, one can argue that these past issues are more than priced in, given the stock’s current low valuation (forward earnings multiple of 10.2x).

Furthermore, as it diversifies its product portfolio, it may have a path to substantially higher prices. Along with this, AbbVie pays out a nice dividend (3.9% forward yield), with its payout growing by double-digits annually over the past five years.

This stock earns a “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

Elevance Health (ELV) Medicine and healthcare concept - team or group of doctors and nurses

Formerly known as Anthem, Elevance Health (NYSE:ELV) is the largest for-profit company providing health insurance under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand. All and all, it’s one of the top-rated large-cap stocks to make a long-term holding.

Although it’s still moving higher, as the market pulls back, ELV stock trades at a favorable valuation (17.5x earnings). It can easily sustain this earnings multiple, as it’s expected to continue growing its earnings per share (EPS) by around 12.8% next year, and by about 13.6% in 2024.

Elevance could continue to climb, in tandem with increased EPS. Its current forward yield of 1.02% may seem tiny, yet in time, it could grow to become mighty. Its low payout ratio (19.31%) leaves ample room for dividend growth. The company has raised its payout by an average of 13.14% over the past five years.

This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

Like healthcare, defense is another sector that can hold up well during challenging economic conditions. General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is a large, high-quality name in the space.

The company provides a wide range of hardware for the U.S. Military, from mortar munitions all the way down to nuclear-powered submarines.

Up by around 16.5% year-to-date, investors have already bought this defense stock as a defensive play. Geopolitical tensions have also played a big role in keeping GD stock in the green in 2022, while markets overall remain deeply in the red.

Even so, the ship hasn’t sailed when it comes to buying it. Alongside a sustainable valuation, General Dynamics also pays a 2.09% dividend. With 27 years of consecutive annual dividend growth, it’s firmly in the “dividend aristocrats” category. For both steady long-term price appreciation and yield, consider it a buy. Whether now, or on any weakness.

This stock earns a “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

Coca-Cola (KO) coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocks

When you think of blue-chip large-cap stocks, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is certainly a name that first springs to mind. The venerable beverage company has been in business since 1886, has paid dividends since going public 100 years ago and has grown its dividend (current forward yield of 2.7%) 59 years in a row.

If you are a conservative investor, looking for steady returns, largely through dividends, you can’t go wrong adding a name like KO stock to your portfolio. Having said that, you may have concerns about its current valuation. Shares today trade for around 26.5x estimated 2022 earnings.

But while its valuation could impact future upside, its current multiple can be viewed as reasonable. Given its high quality, a premium valuation is befitting. Even if you decide to skip it now, keep it on your watchlist. Another market pullback could enable you to pick it up on sale.

This stock earns a “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

After looking at several large-cap stocks best described as “blue chip” or defensive, let’s look at one of the top-rated large-cap stocks still in the high-growth fast lane.

At first, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may not seem like a great stock to own during market volatility. After all, hasn’t the bear market knocked down growth/tech plays like this electric vehicle (EV) maker?

Yes. TSLA stock has dropped around 25.8% since January. Yet while shares could keep struggling in the near term, that’s not to say the same will happen over the long term. Recession or not, the EV revolution isn’t going away.

In fact, recent changes to EV tax credits could boost demand from middle-class buyers. Add in the potential for global sales to re-accelerate, and its long-term growth prospects remain strong. As continued growth could help sustain (and grow) Tesla’s stock price, buying now (while growth remains out of favor) could be a profitable move.

This stock earns a “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

This list of top-rated large-cap stocks may seem healthcare-heavy, but again this underscores how this is a great sector for long-term investors to focus on. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is the largest health insurance company in the United States.

With its consistent revenue and earnings growth, it is no surprise UNH stock has been a winner. Whether in the recent past (up 181.5% since 2017), or on a longer timeframe (more than 9x gain over the past decade). With a market cap above $500 billion, it may take far more than a decade for shares to soar another 9x.

Still, as a leader in its industry, poised to continue growing at an above-average pace, investors buying today stand to be more than satisfied by future returns.  Paying up for quality now (shares trade for 25.1x earnings) could prove worth it.

This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

With crude oil’s retreat back below $100 per barrel, the party may seem over for energy stocks like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Recently, shares in the integrated oil and gas firm have fallen back in line with oil’s slide.

Nevertheless, don’t view this as a sign that post-comeback, it’s middling returns from here for XOM stock. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (or EIA) still calls for crude oil to remain at or near current price levels (around $89 per barrel) through 2023.

Also, as I argued back in June, there are other factors in play that could move the needle for ExxonMobil shares. The company’s cost-cutting plans will give EPS a boost. Its aggressive repurchase of shares will also help to boost EPS, and in turn, its stock price. With a 3.74% forward dividend yield to boot, it’s still a great name to make a long-term position.

This stock earns an “A” rating in my Portfolio Grader.

601,"Tesla Challenged Claims That Accused EV Maker For Racial Bias, California Agency Denied It","California's Office of Administrative Law denied Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) petition to review its claim that the Department of Civil Rights (DCR) prosecuted the EV maker for racial bias without conducting complete investigations, Reuters reports. The OAL did not disclose the reason behind the denial and allowed Tesla to pursue its claims in court. Tesla's flagship Fremont, California, plant allegedly was a racially segregated workplace that harassed and discriminated against black employees regarding job assignments, discipline, and pay. Tesla argued that the DCR sued without first notifying the company of all the claims or giving it a chance to settle. The lawsuit is one of several pending in California courts that accuse Tesla of discrimination and sexual harassment at its factories. In July, several black employees prosecuted Tesla alleging racial abuse and harassment at the company's factories by colleagues, managers, and HR employees. A former black factory worker turned down a $15 million award in a race discrimination lawsuit as it undermined his constitutional rights to a trial by jury.

603,UPDATE 1-Twitter's former security head claims company misled regulators about bot accounts - reports,"(Adds Twitter comment)

Aug 23 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc misled federal regulators about its defenses against hackers and spam accounts, CNN and the Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing whistleblower disclosures by the social media company's former security chief Peiter Zatko.

Twitter executives don't have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to, CNN reported, citing Zatko's complaint.

The social media company is embroiled in a legal battle with Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk after the world's richest person said in July he was ending an agreement to buy the company in a $44 billion deal alleging it had violated the deal contract.

Musk has accused Twitter of hiding information about how it calculates the percentage of bots on the service. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 17.

The complaint by Zatko was filed last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, according to the Washington Post.

Zatko did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment, while Musk could not be reached for comment.

In January, Twitter said nL1N2U11KV Zatko, a famed hacker more widely known as ""Mudge"", was no longer its head of security, two years after being appointed to the role.

A Twitter spokesperson said on Tuesday that Zatko was fired from his senior executive role in January for ""ineffective leadership and poor performance"".

""Zatko's allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.""

John Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko's lawyer, said Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, adding that he began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk's involvement with Twitter, according to CNN.

610,"These Investment Wines Have Outperformed Apple, Ford And Tesla Over The Past Year","As the market volatility extends well into the second half of 2022, alternative investments are increasingly gaining traction against conventional equities and debt instruments. As concerns regarding a global economic slowdown become rampant, equities have demonstrated subpar performance so far this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes currently in the red, in terms of year-to-date performance.

Comparatively, wine investments have paid off over the past year. With robust global demand for fine wine and a rising number of billionaires, some of the best-known fine wines have outperformed shares of industry-leading companies including Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), tech-giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and EV-pioneer Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) over the past year.

2019 Château Lafite Rothschild

Bordeaux is the most popular fine wine producer in the world, accounting for nearly 30% to 40% of the global wine trade. Its 2019 Château Lafite Rothschild became one of the best-selling clarets over the past year. Since June 2021, the price of one bottle of Château Lafite Rothschild has more than doubled. The blue-chip Bordeaux was the most-traded wine globally in the last week of June.

This wine’s one-year return of 104% far outpaced the share prices of Apple, Ford and Tesla.

1998 Château Cheval Blanc

Château Cheval Blanc wines are some of the most prestigious products in the world of fine wine, known for extraordinary aromas. It is one of the few wines that obtained the rank of Premier Grand Cru Classé (A), the highest in the classification of Saint-Émilion wines. The price of a 1998 Cheval Blanc rose 40% year over year from $1,032 per bottle to $1,450 per bottle.

The wine’s one-year return doesn’t quite match that of the 2019 Château Lafite Rothschild, but it’s quite impressive and still beat the price gains of Apple, Ford and Tesla over the same period.

2018 Screaming Eagle

While the French are known for their exquisite wineries, the U.S. is catching up. The 2018 Screaming Eagle wine, produced in the Screaming Eagle Winery and Vineyards in the Napa Valley of California is the third on this list of best-performing wines. The price of a single 2018 Screaming Eagle bottle rose 28% over the past year and is currently valued at $4,666 bottle.

The 2018 Screaming Eagle’s year-over-year gains have been neck and neck with Tesla and clearly outperformed Apple and Ford.

611,Volkswagen teams up with Canada in battery materials push,"FRANKFURT, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Volkswagen, Europe's top carmaker, on Tuesday intensified efforts to secure access to key battery materials lithium, nickel and cobalt by striking a cooperation agreement with top supplier Canada.

The move comes as Volkswagen rolls out its electric vehicle expansion strategy globally and aims to overtake Tesla as the sector leader, a strategy that depends on sufficient supply of vital battery materials.

No financial details were disclosed for the memorandum of understanding (MoU), which was signed during a visit by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and a delegation of German corporate representatives.

""The supply of battery raw materials and the production of precursor and cathode materials with a low carbon footprint will allow for a fast and sustainable ramp-up of battery capacity - a key lever for our growth strategy in North America,"" outgoing Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess said.

Volkswagen aims to build, with partners, six large battery cell factories in Europe by 2030 with a capacity of around 240 gigawatt hours, as well as a dedicated factory in North America for which it is currently examining potential sites.

Under the agreement with Canada, Volkswagen aims to deepen cooperation with Canada's mining sector and could even become a shareholder in local mining firms to make sure it is first in line when it comes to supply.

The MoU also includes the production ramp-up of so-called cathode materials, which include nickel cobalt aluminium (NCA) oxide and nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) oxide. (Reporting by Christoph Steitz, Editing by Miranda Murray)",2022-08-23T14:30:00+00:00,2022-08-23

FRANKFURT, Aug 23 (Reuters) - German carmakers Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz on Tuesday intensified efforts to secure access to key battery materials lithium, nickel and cobalt by striking cooperation agreements with top supplier Canada.

Mercedes-Benz, meantime, is preparing to go fully electric by the end of the decade wherever market conditions allow, and has recently struck a deal with China's CATL to ensure battery cell supply in Europe.

As part of the MoU, Mercedes-Benz will explore a strategic partnership with Rock Tech Lithium under which the Canadian firm would supply the German carmaker and its battery partners with up to 10,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide a year from 2026.

Video Transcript

RACHELLE AKUFFO: We turn to Berenzweig Leonard LLP Managing Partner Seth Berenzweig. Good to see you, Seth. So with these latest bombshells coming from this whistleblower, then, how much could this potentially move the needle here?

SETH BERENZWEIG: Well, it's pretty significant. This really dropped like a bombshell here in Washington, and it is still reverberating through the congress and the agencies. But as far as the Delaware case is concerned, it really has had, I believe, a very dramatic impact. Keep in mind that before this was disclosed, Twitter was really on a roll.

It had some important early motions in terms of getting the judge to basically slam dunk their requests for an expedited trial, expedited discovery. This is going to go to trial in mid-October, which is very fast. And they were really kind of looking like they were on a cakewalk, because it's a very difficult case to prove that Twitter engaged in malfeasance in order to be able to misstate its bot traffic, among other things.

Well, all of a sudden, we wake up this morning to a whole different picture. We have this whistleblower complaint by Peter Zatko, who is represented by a well-known whistleblower law firm-- and, in addition to some startling comments from people such as Chuck Grassley in the Senate saying this might even rise to a national security level, this really changes the entire narrative on a number of issues. I agree with the statement made a moment ago that it affects, for example, the bots issue.

And what Mr. Zatko is saying is that the company knowingly misrepresented the bots. He says that it's not the stated 5% level. He said it's roughly 30% because of how they calculate these so-called MDAUs-- monetizable daily active users. He says that they are twisting the data to focus on the accounts that are actively looking at advertising.

Story continues

But he points out that, by definition, purposefully ignores fake accounts and bots. So he's saying that is an active manipulation of the data. This is basically a gift from the heavens that's dropped into Elon Musk's lap and really immediately changes the contour and the context of this big lawsuit.

SEANA SMITH: Well, Seth, I guess what exactly needs to be proven? Because how does Musk then prove the extent to which he did rely on the bots claim when making this deal initially?

SETH BERENZWEIG: Well, what he would have to establish, which is not easy-- so this case is going to be a close call-- but he'll have to show that both he and all the other fellow investors were purposefully deceived as it relates to bot traffic and things that had a material impact on the operation and the viability of the company. So in other words, that the company engaged in a practice of purposeful deception, that they, as Mr. Zatko alleges, purposefully deceived the board, purposefully filed information that it knew or should have known was inaccurate at the time for their quarterly filings and things of that nature-- then not only does he have a little bit of leverage now on the MDAU issue, but there are other things that he can leverage as well.

For example, the whistleblower complaint alleges that the company failed to properly license various aspects of important software that Twitter uses to activate their AI capabilities. Well, there's a provision in this deal, which is typical in the M&A world, that says that the company reps and warrants that it has not intentionally or knowingly violated the intellectual property rights of another company. That's usually a toss away.

Well, if this allegation is true, then this is just something else that fell right into Elon Musk's lap. So there are a variety of issues. And really, the entire context of this case may have changed overnight.

DAVE BRIGGS: If only he'd had you as his attorney, though when he signed his contract waiving due diligence, though. I can't get around the fact that he said in this contract he was willing to accept their estimates and their reports. And their SEC filing acknowledges that it may not be right. They may be just in the ballpark, if not exactly even close. Do I have it right?

SETH BERENZWEIG: No, you're absolutely right. And not only are you spot on, but you're really highlighting something that is such a big deal as to the uniqueness of this case and why this is such an unforced error by Twitter. It is unbelievably rare in the mergers and acquisitions community, in the deal space, to have waived due diligence.

Elon Musk, who always beats to his own drum, waived due diligence. It is not a condition to closing. That is unbelievable. That should have made this case a cakewalk for Twitter.

But you're absolutely right. And as a result of that-- now, he has to show some kind of purposefully deceptive and misleading conduct as it relates to things like the bots. So you're absolutely right. And it would really be stunning-- this is a real significant change of events and a real u-turn in a case in a trial that is really coming up in a couple of weeks.

DAVE BRIGGS: Five days in Delaware going to be good-- Twitter shares down about 6% on the day. Berenzweig Leonard Managing Partner Seth Berenzweig, good to see you, sir. Thank you.",2022-08-23T19:34:05+00:00,2022-08-23
622,Yellow (YELL) and Tesla (TSLA) Are Aggressive Growth Stocks,"Brian Bolan is the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research and he has two more names for your aggressive growth radar screen.

This time around, Brian is looking at two transportation stocks.  The transportation sector happens to be atop the Zacks Sector Rank right now so this is a very timely piece.

The first name on the list is Yellow YELL which is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)  that sports A’s for the Zacks Style Scores for Growth and for Value.  Brian talked a little about how he likes to see the growth divergence, but it isn’t a necessity.

Brian reviewed the valuation for this less than a truck load logistics name and really liked it.  Yellow YELL has been placed on the aggressive growth stock radar screen.

Next up is Tesla (TSLA) which is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and of course sports some great growth. The valuation for this stock is rather high, but Brian was focused on something else.

Tesla TSLA is splitting its stock later this week and there are host of other potential catalysts for the stock as well.  Brian shows a tweet that listed a number of those catalysts.

Brian also teased the idea of the Tesla Power Wall – a battery that is used to store electricity.  Sometime these batteries are connected to solar panels, but Brian has found some instances of the local electric utility having control over the battery.  We will have to wait a little longer for Brian to do more homework on that topic but it sounds rather interesting.

624,Musk Gets a Potential Boost With Twitter Whistle-Blower’s Claims,"(Bloomberg) -- A whistle-blower’s complaint alleging Twitter Inc. ignored a rash of spam and bot accounts could help Elon Musk in his effort to walk away from a $44 billion buyout of the social-media platform, legal experts say.

Peiter Zatko, Twitter’s ex-head of security, alerted US authorities to “egregious deficiencies” in the company’s defenses against hackers, according to his complaint. Zatko, fired from Twitter earlier this year, said he raised concerns about the bots in early 2021 and was told by the head of site integrity that Twitter didn’t know how many bots were on the platform. His Twitter colleagues showed no interest in delving into the issue, according to the complaint.

“We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding,” Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, said in a statement Tuesday.

Twitter sued Musk in July to force him to complete his proposed acquisition. Since then, dozens of people, banks, funds and other firms have been subpoenaed in the Delaware lawsuit, with a trial scheduled to begin Oct. 17. At the center of Musk’s defense are the company’s disclosures about the quality of its customer base as it is affected by spam and automated accounts.

‘Smoking Gun’

Zatko claims Twitter executives failed to disclose the true extent of such accounts on the platform. Spiro said he learned from court filings that Twitter officials didn’t consider Zatko to be knowledgeable about spam accounts on the system and that they declined to search Zatko’s files as part of the exchange of information in the case.

Story continues

Zatko’s complaint was reported earlier by the Washington Post and CNN.

If Zatko’s assertions are true, “that’s just the kind of smoking gun Musk had to be pinning his hopes on,” said Larry Hamermesh, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who specializes in merger-and-acquisition disputes.

In the complaint, Zatko said Twitter’s “Integrity Team” was reluctant to dig deeply into how many bot accounts were included in the platform’s customer base. That left the former security executive thinking “the company had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots, in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.”

Twitter said Zatko was fired for cause.

“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the company said in a statement. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.”

‘Opportunistic Timing’

Twitter said Zatko’s allegations and “opportunistic timing” seemed “designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders.” It added that “security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be” and that it “fully stands by its prior statements about the percentage of bot and spam accounts on the service.”

Bloomberg was unable to reach Zatko for comment. Whistleblower Aid, which represents him, said he stands by his disclosures.

“His career of ethical and effective leadership speaks for itself,” John Tye, the group’s chief disclosure officer, said in an emailed statement. “The focus should be on the facts laid out in the disclosure, not ad hominem attacks against the whistle blower.”

It’s hard to tell whether Zatko’s claims significantly affect the Twitter-Musk case, said Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania professor who tracks Delaware corporate law cases.

“Whistle-blower complaints can raise serious issues or just be a bunch of sour grapes,” Fisch said. “We just don’t know at this point how credible” the complaint is, she said.

Marginal Boost

Bloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst Matthew Schettenhelm wrote in a note on Tuesday that the complaint “only marginally bolsters Musk’s case with Twitter.”

“The key: the report doesn’t show a direct misleading statement in Twitter’s SEC filings,” Schettenhelm wrote. “To the contrary, Zatko undercuts Musk’s central claim Twitter misled about its mDAU count. Zatko says Twitter’s ‘already doing a decent job excluding spam bots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU.’”

He was referring to monetizable daily active users, a key industry metric.

Musk has argued that Twitter’s regulatory disclosures putting spam and bot accounts at no more than 5% of its customer base were misleading. The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer has made public some of his analysis of the issue, which holds that a full third of Twitter’s more than 230 million users may fall into the bot category.

‘Game Over’

Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware professor who ran the school’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, said the complaint, if accurate, would be a bombshell.

“The bottom line question here is whether Twitter was entirely candid with Musk about these bots,” Elson said. “If it turns out they were not, it could be game over.”

Zatko was hired by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Musk’s legal team subpoenaed Dorsey on Monday, after serving Kayvon Beykpour, ex-head of consumer product at Twitter, and Bruce Falck, who oversaw product revenue. Both were fired.

Hamermesh noted that Zatko’s allegations hadn’t yet been verified and said it’s up to Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick to decide whether Musk’s abandonment of the deal was proper.

“It’s still a long way from the hole for Mr. Musk to sink that putt,” he said.

The case is Twitter v. Musk, 22-0613, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

User apps show charging stations are down in Chengdu in Sichuan province -- where the nation’s worst drought since the 1960s has slashed hydropower generation at the same time a punishing heatwave has sent electricity demand surging -- and the nearby city of Chongqing.

Nio posted temporary notices on its app’s charging map page informing owners that some of its Chengdu battery-swapping stations are “off-line” because of the “severe overload on the grid under the persisting high temperatures.”

Tesla turned off or restrictes services at more than a dozen super-charging stations in the two cities, leaving just two still in operation and only during the night as of Aug. 17, local media reported, citing a letter from a driver.

The power cuts in Sichuan have added to the woes of manufacturers including Toyota Motor Corp. and battery producer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., which have had to shut factories.

Teld New Energy, which operates around 300,000 charging pylons nationwide, is asking drivers to check if the services are online before setting out, because local power authorities have requested a shutdown of some facilities. The company is also offering preferential rates for users who charge late at night or early in the morning to avoid the peak time for power demand.

In the meantime, Nio is calling for users in Sichuan to share their home chargers between Aug. 20 and Sept. 20, while some drivers are trading their fully-charged batteries for almost-dead ones at swapping stations to help fellow owners.

The funds boosted tech and consumer discretionary holdings, while cutting energy and materials wagers, strategists including Ben Snider wrote in a note Tuesday. Separately, average weightings of top 10 holdings jumped to 70% in the three months ended June, the highest concentration since the first quarter of 2020.

Amazon.com Inc. supplanted Microsoft Corp. as the most popular long position, a timely call this quarter with the former’s 26% gain more than tripling the 8% climb in the latter. The funds also boosted bets on Nvidia Corp., Apple Inc., Atlassian Corp. and Tesla Inc., according to the report.

“Stymied by an uncertain market environment and poor recent returns, hedge funds have cut leverage, shifted back towards growth, and increased portfolio concentrations,” the Goldman team wrote. “Performance has recently improved, matching the typical experience during correction rebounds, though leverage has room to rise if the market remains resilient.”

Beleaguered tech stocks got a shot in the arm in mid-June, as traders reassessed bets on the number of future rate hikes by the Federal Reserve after the US economy showed signs of slowing. A gauge of megacap tech stocks has risen 10% this quarter, compared to a 9% rise in the S&P 500 Index.

But the optimism has petered out heading into this week’s Jackson Hole conference on renewed hawkish concerns, with the market split on whether the Nasdaq 100’s near 13% jump in July was anything more than a bear market rally.

Story continues

“There will likely be more pain ahead as markets are still under-pricing the Fed rate path,” said Charu Chanana, strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Pte.

In other signs of conviction, position turnover fell to a record low of 23%, the Goldman report found. The study analyzed the holdings of hedge funds with a combined $2.4 trillion of gross equity positions.

The average fund gained 4% since the start of July, narrowing year-to-date losses to 9%, the strategists said.

“The recent stabilization of hedge fund leverage and outperformance of the most popular hedge fund long positions are consistent with the typical patterns around previous equity market drawdown troughs,” they added.

630,Tesla to urge dismissal of California agency's race bias lawsuit,"By Daniel Wiessner

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's lawyers on Wednesday will urge a California judge to throw out a lawsuit by the state's civil rights agency accusing the electric car maker of widespread race discrimination at an assembly plant.

California Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo in Oakland will hold a hearing on Tesla's bid to dismiss the lawsuit by the state Department of Civil Rights (DCR). Tesla, which is facing a series of other discrimination lawsuits brought by employees, says the case is politically motivated.

In a complaint filed in February, the DCR said Tesla's flagship Fremont, California, plant was a racially segregated workplace where Black employees were harassed and discriminated against in terms of job assignments, discipline and pay.

Tesla, which has denied wrongdoing, and its lawyers did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Neither did the DCR, which until last month was called the Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

Austin, Texas-based Tesla is facing a series of race and sex discrimination cases, most involving the Fremont plant.

A state judge in April cut a jury verdict for a Black worker who alleged racial harassment from $137 million to $15 million. The plaintiff rejected the reduced award and opted for a new trial, which is scheduled for March 2023.

In its motion to dismiss the DCR's case, Tesla says the agency flouted its obligations under state law by filing the lawsuit without first notifying the company of all of the claims or giving it a chance to settle.

The agency has responded that before suing, it followed all of its internal procedures including giving Tesla an opportunity to enter mediation.

Tesla in June filed a complaint with a different state agency, the California Office of Administrative Law, claiming the DCR's alleged lapses are widespread and the procedures adopted by the agency are unlawful. The OAL earlier this month declined to review Tesla's petition without giving a reason for doing so.

Story continues

There is little precedent for challenging the powers of anti-discrimination agencies that are granted broad authority to sue employers.

In the 2015 case Mach Mining v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, involving the agency that enforces federal anti-bias laws, the U.S. Supreme Court said courts cannot delve into the details of how the agency conducts itself before suing.

California law, which is similar to the federal law enforced by the EEOC, says the DCR ""shall endeavor"" to settle bias claims through ""conference, conciliation, and persuasion"" before suing, but does not establish strict requirements for the agency to follow.

The California-based startup plans to develop software and hardware that would create an “ecosystem” for a home with solar panels and electrical appliances to use energy efficiently, according to Girotra. Over the past 18 months, Lunar completed two funding rounds of $150 million each; its backers include Sunrun Inc., the largest solar installation company in the US, and SK Inc., a South Korean holding company. Lunar, which Girotra says has been in stealth development since mid-2020, declined to disclose its current valuation.

Lunar expects to launch its first product by the end of the year, and Girotra will only share only that it’s a home battery system capable of controlling energy loads and enabling a house “to become its own power plant.” In other words, taking power from the grid when needed, storing energy from a home solar system when possible, and discharging extra power back to the grid for sale. “All you need to do is bring solar panels,” Girotra says. “We'll do the rest to provide an end-to-end energy storage system.”

About 26% of US households are fully electrified, meaning electricity is their only source of energy, according to the Energy Information Administration. Most homes use electricity and at least one other fuel source to power their appliances. Lunar is hoping that a more cohesive and inexpensive system of energy storage will allow more homeowners to switch to using electricity only.

In June 2021, Lunar acquired UK-based Moixa, whose cloud-based software connects batteries from multiple homes to sell excess power back to the grid. Lunar paid an undisclosed amount for the company, which currently has a fleet of batteries in the UK, as well as more than 30,000 in Japan. Girotra says Lunar wants to expand that technology to the US.

Lunar is far from the only startup tapping into the potential of home electrification. Sunrun, one of Lunar’s majority investors, is also focused on helping consumers lease or buy new solar systems. Lynn Jurich, former Sunrun CEO and now co-executive chair, said the company decided to invest in Lunar to realize a mutual goal. “It just makes sense to have two separate companies that are complementary and running at the same outcome,” said Jurich, who is also the chair of Lunar’s board of operations.

Tesla is exploring its own virtual power plant pilot programs in Texas and California, though the carmaker’s solar rooftop project has proven a bit of a bust.

632,3 Cathie Wood Stocks That Could Double by 2025,"It’s been a rough year for growth stocks, and thus a rough year for Cathie Wood. In fact, it’s been longer than that, as her flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), topped out in February 2021. With the recent rally though, investors wondering about Cathie Wood stocks that could double by 2025.

For that, we won’t look at growth stocks as a whole but instead focus specifically on her ARKK fund holdings. These positions are closely watched by investors, particularly those that also invest in growth stocks.

Ark is constantly buying and selling and even rotates through its top holdings. Currently, the top three holdings are Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in that order, with stakes of 9.7%, 9% and 8%, respectively.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Investors bullish on these three holdings or on growth, in general, could consider being long the ARKK ETF. For it to double off its lows, it needs to reach $70. Even then, that would barely equate to recovering one-quarter of its peak-to-trough decline.

For those looking for more specific opportunities, here are a few Cathie Wood stocks that could double by 2025.

ROKU Roku $68.85 TWLO Twilio $72.84 SHOP Shopify $32.47

Roku is listed above as a top holding for the ARKK ETF, but there is a potential for the stock to double. To double from current levels, Roku stock needs to hit roughly $150. To double off the lows, it needs to clear $124.

For a stock that was almost trading at $500 13 months ago and for a company that remains firmly planted in the secular trend of streaming video, it’s more than possible for a move of this magnitude.

Even before the Covid selloff, Roku had hit a high of $176. Its business has grown considerably since then. However, its main problem right now is the lack of ad dollars. In the most recent quarter, Roku missed on earnings and revenue estimates. Worse, guidance for next quarter was woefully short of expectations.

Story continues

The company needs to find a trough in its business and stem the losses. If it can do that, the stock will fly. Since streaming video isn’t doing anything but growing, I struggle to imagine a scenario where this most intriguing of Cathie Wood stocks doesn’t improve over the next 24 months.

I have written about Twilio’s (NYSE:TWLO) tendency for disappointing earnings reactions in the past. That’s both good and bad for bulls.

It’s bad because investors want to own Cathie Wood stocks like this that have powerful upside earnings reactions. However, it’s good for long-term bulls because it can often provide them with a buying opportunity.

Unfortunately though, Twilio stock is in the midst of an enormous downtrend and just made new 52-week lows on Monday, Aug. 22. TWLO is now down about 84% from the all-time high, with shares needing to climb to $150 for them to double.

Twilio is the seventh largest holding in the ARKK fund, but continues struggling to show a profit. In the most recent quarter, Twilio delivered a top- and bottom-line beat and grew revenue by 41% year over year.

However, guidance was a little light of Street expectations — particularly for earnings — and the stock has struggled since the report despite a broad-based rally in growth.

I don’t know when Twilio will bottom or when the market will end its downtrend. However, Twilio is a top pick when it does come back to life and has very strong forward estimates when it comes to revenue growth.

Like ARKK, investors seem to have turned against Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). While it was hitting all-time highs in the fourth quarter of 2021, shares have suffered a tremendous fall in a short period of time.

The stock fell 82.5% from its high, recently bottoming around $30 a share.

As a top holding in the ARKK fund though, it should not take much of a rally to get the stock to double from current levels. Now trading just below $33 as of Aug. 22, Shopify stock now only needs to rally to roughly $65 to become one of the Cathie Wood stocks that could double by 2025.

This is a hated name and while management has been forthcoming about getting the post-pandemic environment wrong and as short-term profitability has collapsed, this company still has growth.

Analysts expect 20% revenue growth this year, 24% growth in 2023, 29% growth in 2024 and 39% growth in 2025. That 2025 estimate may be a little too aggressive, but if these multi-year forecasts calling for accelerating growth pan out, a double is not hard to picture.

Further, a double from the low-$30s only recoups about one-quarter of the losses from the highs.

User apps indicated that charging stations were down in Chengdu in Sichuan province. The nation's worst drought since the 1960s has cut hydropower generation with a heatwave sending electricity demand surging and the nearby city of Chongqing. Nio posted temporary notices on its app's charging map page informing that some of its Chengdu battery-swapping stations were ""off-line"" due to the ""severe overload on the grid under the persisting high temperatures."" Tesla turned off or restricted services at more than a dozen super-charging stations in the two cities, leaving just two still in operation and only during the night as of August 17. Nio urged users in Sichuan to share their home chargers between August 20 and September 20, while some drivers traded their fully-charged batteries for almost-dead ones at swapping stations to help fellow owners. The power cuts in Sichuan also hampered manufacturers' production, including Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM) and battery producer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Tesla added 32 Supercharger stations with 120 individual charging stalls in China in June. The calamity could not have been more ill-timed, especially as they recuperated from the recent stringent COVID-19 lockdowns while battling an economic slowdown and inflation.

639,Top 10 Technology Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness,"This article discusses the top 10 top technology sector picks of Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management at the end of June and elaborates on Mr. Asness’ experience, the fund’s history and recent performance. If you want to know only the top five stock picks of the fund from the technology sector, please read Top 5 Technology Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.

Cliff Asness is a name that needs no introduction on Wall Street. Mr. Asness credentials and CV are filled with some of the most reputed schools and organizations that one can imagine. He graduated summa cum laude with a double major in computer science and economics from Moore School of Electrical Engineering and Wharton School, respectively, at the University of Pennsylvania. He followed it up with an M.B.A. with high honors and a Ph.D. in finance from the University of Chicago.

At the University of Chicago, Mr. Asness worked as a teaching assistant for Nobel laureate Eugene Fama, who was also Mr. Asness’ doctoral advisor. Eugene Fama and Kenneth French are considered the founders of factor investing, which became extremely popular in the last two decades. In 1992, Mr. Fama and Mr. French developed the Fama–French three-factor model, which expanded on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), adding the size of a company and its valuation as two other factors that can adequately measure the riskiness of a stock.

Further research on these factors by Mr. Asness led him to persuade his seniors at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, where Mr. Asness was working as a manager at the quantitative research desk, to provide him with $10 million in 1995 to deploy his computer-driven models. Goldman Sachs’ initial $10 million investment in an in-house investment vehicle later became the famous Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund. Mr. Asness left Goldman Sachs in 1998 to start AQR Capital Management, one of the first large-scale quantitative asset management firms, along with David Kabiller, John Liew, and Robert Krail. AQR Capital Management is today a behemoth in the quantitative asset management industry, managing capital worth over $140 billion through multiple hedge funds and mutual funds. As per AQR Capital Management’s latest 13F filing, its top ten stock picks, which include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), accounted for 14% of the aggregate value of its portfolio, at the end of June.

Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) popularity among smart money investors seems to have followed its stock price trajectory. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey that disclosed a stake in the EV major increased to 92 from 29 between September 2019 and the end of 2021. However, since then, the hedge funds have been selling their holdings in the company as only 72 hedge funds we cover disclosed a stake Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at the end of Q2.

According to a recent report published on Electrek, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)  would soon open its charging stations to non-Tesla owners. Opening its charging station network is critical for the company as that will allow it to access funds from the Federal government reserved for accelerating the deployment of EV charging states in the country. On August 18, Reuters reported that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) had reduced the waiting time for its Model Y car in China to a minimum of four weeks. The company had revealed earlier that customers in China needed to wait for 8 to 24 weeks to get their keys for some of the company’s bestselling cars.

Percentage of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Portfolio: 0.6%

Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) stock might have fallen more than 30% year-to-date, but this decline has made it a bargain at its current trading price.

In a note to clients, Citigroup analyst Christopher Danely maintained his ‘Neutral’ rating on Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) stock on August 16. Mr. Danely wrote:

“We reiterate our Neutral ratings on Intel and AMD as we expect the downturn in the PC market to negatively impact both and our estimates remain below consensus.”

For its most recent quarter of FY 2022, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reported GAAP earnings per share loss of $0.11, missing analysts’ estimate by $0.64.

8. Arrow Electronics, Inc. (NYSE:ARW)

AQR Capital Management’s Stake Value: $269,562,000

Previously, Mr. Agrawal served as an executive vice president and chief financial officer at The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU). Earlier in May, Arrow Electronics, Inc. (NYSE:ARW) announced that Sean J. Kerins would succeed Michael J. Long as the company’s chief executive officer (CEO), effective June 1, 2022. Mr. Kerins has worked at Arrow Electronics, Inc. (NYSE:ARW) for 15 years and has been serving as the company’s chief operating officer since December 2020.

7. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)

AQR Capital Management’s Stake Value: $291,729,000

Percentage of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Portfolio: 0.65%

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63

AQR Capital Management upped its stake in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) by 16% to 6,906,458 shares during Q2. Other prominent hedge funds tracked by us that also increased their stake in the networking giant during that time included billionaire Bruce Kovner’s Caxton Associates LP, Israel Englander’s Millennium Management, and Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management.

Cisco Systems, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock has gone up by over 150% in the last 10 years but still trades below the all-time high it made during the peak of the tech boom of the late 1990s. On August 18, the stock jumped by more than 6.5% following the company’s better than expected fourth-quarter earnings release and strong guidance for future quarters.

After the fourth quarter earnings release, several analysts covering Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) on Wall Street increased their price target on the stock. This included Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall, who raised the price target to $48 from $46 while maintaining a ‘Neutral’ rating on the stock and Citigroup analyst Jim Suva, who, despite continuing with his ‘Sell’ rating on the stock, increased his price target to $44 from $40.

6. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)

AQR Capital Management’s Stake Value: $365,974,000

Percentage of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Portfolio: 0.82%

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 252

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) got displaced to the second most popular stock among hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey from the top spot, with only 252 hedge funds reporting a stake in the company at the end of Q2 from 271 funds at the end of Q1. The fall of nearly 35% that Amazon.com, Inc.’s  (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock saw during Q2 could be one of the reasons that smart money investors were bailing out of the stock in that period.

On August 10, Bloomberg reported that CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) was in talks with 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONEM) to acquire the latter before Amazon.com, Inc.  (NASDAQ:AMZN) jumped in and, on July 21, announced that it would acquire the membership-based primary care platform for $3.9 billion.

According to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Amazon.com, Inc.’s  (NASDAQ:AMZN) new Inferentia chip, which is being mass produced and will be shipped in Q4, can increase the company’s AWS division’s dominance in the cloud computing market. In a series of tweets on August 16, Mr. Kuo said:

“My latest survey indicates all-new design AWS Inferentia chip (Alchip being the ASIC design service provider) will start mass production/shipments in 4Q22. Thanks to the adoption of the 7nm advanced node (vs. existing 16nm), it markedly improves performance & latency.

From Amazon’s last earnings call, AWS’s revenue beats the market consensus and is a critical profit driver amid the recession. The new AWS Inferentia can strengthen AWS’s competitiveness and growth momentum further.

For Alchip, the new AWS Inferentia with a higher unit price can benefit revenue/profits and increase the proportion of US customers to lower geopolitical risks.”

641,Ex-Twitter chief's whistleblower complaint is a 'godsend' for Elon Musk,"Twitter’s (TWTR) ex-security chief has filed a whistleblower complaint with claims that, if proven true, could make it easier for Elon Musk to walk away from his $44 billion deal to buy the social media company.

Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, a widely respected hacker who was fired in January, sent a 200-page complaint to federal officials accusing Twitter’s top executives of violating laws and regulations by covering up lax security, and eschewing resources to fully understand its prevalence of fake accounts. The issue of fake accounts plays a central role in the legal battle between Musk and Twitter, which is suing him in an attempt to force him to go through with the deal.

The whistleblower claims regarding fake accounts present a considerable tide change in the lawsuit, set for trial in Delaware Chancery Court beginning Oct. 17. Prior to the claims, some legal experts had predicted that the seller-friendly merger agreement would tip the case in Twitter’s favor, with Delaware's Chancellor ordering Musk to go through with the deal.

“This changes everything,” University of Iowa law professor Robert Miller said about the claims. “This is like a godsend for Musk. The whistleblower’s complaints, if true…are exactly what Musk needs to get out of the deal. I mean, tailor made.”

'The timing is amazing'

Weeks after agreeing on April 25 to acquire Twitter’s outstanding stock at $54.20 per share, Musk posted on Twitter hinting of cold feet. A termination letter from his lawyers followed, accusing Twitter of breaching the deal by withholding the methods it used in its public filings to estimate that less than 5% of its 238 million monetizable daily active users or ""mDAUs"" are fake or spam accounts. Musk and his lawyers say they suspect the number is higher.

If Zatko’s complaint is accurate, Miller and two other legal experts tell Yahoo Finance that it would make it easier for Musk to accuse Twitter of fraud, and in turn, use the fraud claim as a basis for exiting the deal. Musk’s has previously faced an uphill argument in the claim that Twitter breached a contractual information-sharing duty to turn over data backing up its estimate because Musk waived his right to further due diligence. And without access to Twitter's data, Musk would have a tough time proving that Twitter's regulatory filings misrepresented its mDAUs.

Story continues Elon Musk photo, Twitter logos and U.S. dollar banknotes are seen in this illustration, August 10, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

Musk's lawyers also allege that Twitter overstated its number of users, causing the company to experience a “material adverse effect” — another difficult-to-prove legal standard that in rare instances allows a buyer to terminate a merger if a target's business operations change significantly.

Now Musk is armed with a witness who can strengthen his case, according to Case Western Reserve University law school professor Anat Beck.

“Musk’s lawyers will try to use [Zatko] to show fraud or a misstatement and try to get around the material adverse effect issue,” Beck said. “The timing is amazing for Musk’s case.”

In an email to Yahoo Finance, a spokesperson for Twitter raised skepticism about that timing, calling it “opportunistic” and noting that Zatko had been fired in January based on “ineffective leadership and poor performance.”

“What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context,” Twitter’s spokesperson said.

Widener University Delaware Law professor Lawrence Hamermesh says now that Zatko’s claims are in play, Musk’s case no longer rests on guesses about Twitter’s fake account figures, which Musk himself admitted lacking enough data to prove.

Instead he’ll have the opportunity to elicit testimony from Zatko, who has alleged that Twitter’s executives knowingly lacked tools to know how many fake accounts ran on its network, a claim that conflicts with Twitter’s regulatory filings that say the company stands behind its spam and bot counting methods.

“If it pans out, Musk’s case looks a lot better,” Hamermesh told Yahoo Finance. “I didn’t think he really had much of a case without this.”

Aside from any viable evidence from Zatko, Musk would still need more to prevail on a fraud claim, the lawyers say. The Tesla chief must prove that Twitter knowingly made a material false or misleading statement about the fake account estimates, and also show that he relied upon the inaccurate information. Material statements are those that significantly impact Musk's expectations under the contract.

It's a little harder for Musk to show that he relied on bot or spam representations, Miller said, because he claims he always knew that Twitter had more than the estimated percentage of bots. However, if Musk can persuade the judge that the problem was worse than he expected, or that he relied on Twitter operating in accordance with the law when it didn’t, Musk may be able to rescind the contract.

Chester Spatt, former chief economist and director of the SEC’s Office of Economic Analysis, said he could see Zatko’s complaint as posing a real problem for Twitter if it shows Twitter's leadership knew that the company made misrepresentations to regulators.

“The Twitter leadership is basically being accused of lying, and in particular that those lies, indirectly, would have permeated regulatory filings on which investors must reasonably rely,” Spatt said. ""It's a statement that the executives knew and that they systematically lied. This is what this is what I think quickly could create the problem.""

In an email to Yahoo Finance, John Tye, chief disclosure officer for Whistleblower Aid, an organization providing legal representation to Zatko said, “Mudge stands by everything in his disclosure, and his career of ethical and effective leadership speaks for itself. The focus should be on the facts laid out in the disclosure, not ad hominem attacks against the whistleblower.""

Shares of Twitter closed at $39.86 on Tuesday, down 7.3% from the previous day's close.

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I'm keeping a close eye on Tesla here on the day, of course. This is on the day of their three-for-one stock split. That's going to take effect after the close of trade. And this was voted on, on the 4th of August and approved by shareholders there. So it's effective following today's close. And three-for-one essentially just means that the shares as priced tomorrow. Once you start to see them trading pre-market, they're going to be at about $300 if you kind of just divide this number by 3. Simple math.

BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, wow, thinking back, back to that call that we talked for call of the day on Tesla. But look, I'm looking at SoFi. I'm still trying to figure out why it has been such a rip roaring move higher in that share, just given where we are with the student loan crisis. But that is not a move I think a lot of people expected of news like that.

JULIE HYMAN: Well, we are expecting a conclusion, at least. This has been an overhang for this stock for so, so long. That's something that we talked to the CEO, Anthony Noto, about. And so now it looks like there's anticipation that we'll get some more clarity on what's happening with student loan relief.",2022-08-24T15:12:35+00:00,2022-08-24

647,Stock Splits: 7 Companies That Should Follow Tesla’s Lead,"The best known of the upcoming stock splits is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It will split its stock today, Aug. 24, after the close of trading. The three-for-one split will reduce the electric vehicle maker’s share price to less than $300.

It will be Elon Musk’s second stock split since the beginning of the pandemic. Tesla stock split five-for-one in August 2020. This means that for every share you held in March 2020, you’ll now own 15.

Companies like Tesla split their stock, rationalizing that a lower share price makes it easier for retail investors to get on board. However, fractional shares make this argument nonsensical.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

And yet, they continue to happen, despite this reality. So, the question is, when does it make sense to split a company’s shares?

I would argue that the best stock splits are those that have minimal share counts. After all, the more shares outstanding, the higher the liquidity. Some institutional investors can’t buy certain stocks because they have insufficient volume. Stock splits remedy this problem.

Based on this argument, I would like to see the following seven stock splits from seven different sectors. All of them have a share count of 50 million or less.

Shares Outstanding:5.88 million

Market Capitalization: $7.35 billion

5-Year Cumulative Return: 68.69%

Cable One (NYSE:CABO) provides broadband services under the Sparklight brand to more than 1.1 million residential and commercial customers in 24 states.

In the second quarter, its revenues grew 6.8% to $429.1 million, while its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 6.7% to $227.5 million.

Story continues

In September 2021, in an article, I recommended investors sell AT&T (NYSE:T) — it’s down 12% since then through Aug. 23 — and consider Cable One instead. Unfortunately, it’s done even worse, down 34%.

My rationale for Cable One was that it grew at a decent clip and historically outperformed AT&T stock. Further, Cable One was spun-off from Graham Holdings (NYSE:GHC) in July 2015. Graham Holdings Chairman Donald Graham still owns 8% of Cable One.

Trading at $1,250, a 10-for-1 split would bring its shares outstanding to more than 58 million while reducing its share price much closer to $100. The current median target price from analysts is $1,600, 28% higher than its current share price.

I liked its share price at $1,900. I can’t help but like it at $1,250, even without any stock splits.

Shares Outstanding:26.53 million

Market Capitalization: $8.66 billion

5-Year Cumulative Return: 413.9%

In recent years, Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) has lost its reputation as a one-trick pony. No longer is it entirely dependent on its UGG brand to drive revenue and profits. It’s now got a one-two punch with Hoka One One running shoes a close second by revenue.

“Deckers acquired Hoka One One in April 2013. At the time, Hoka had annual revenue of approximately $3 million. Deckers’ management thought its yearly sales could get to $100 million someday,” I wrote on July 19.

“In fiscal 2022 (March 31 year-end), Hoka’s sales were $892 million, almost 9x its original target. By fiscal 2023, Decker’s will have two billion-dollar brands.”

In the company’s Q1 2023 results, Hoka went over $1 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months. Its revenues were more than $120 million higher than UGG’s. Despite the margin contraction in the first quarter, Deckers still expects revenue of at least $3.45 billion and earnings per share of $17.50 in fiscal 2023.

DECK stock is down 25% over the past year. It now trades at 2.77x sales, its lowest valuation since 2019.

It’s a long-term buy.

Casey’s General Stores (CASY) Image of Casey's General Store logo on side of a store

Shares Outstanding:37.19 million

Market Capitalization: $8.08 billion

5-Year Cumulative Return: 106.47%

Thirteen analysts cover Casey’s General Stores (NASDAQ:CASY). Of those, eight rates it a buy, with a median target price of $235.

Casey’s operates more than 2,400 convenience stores in 16 Midwestern states. Founded in 1968 in Iowa, the company is opening new stores in towns with larger populations. It used to be that a majority of its stores were located in towns of 5,000 or less. Today, 25% have a population of 20,000 or more, and that percentage is growing.

Like many convenience stores that also sell gas, a significant portion of its revenues are from low-margin gas sales. In fiscal 2022, 64% of its $13.0 billion in sales were from gas, but only 34% of its $2.8 billion gross profit. However, its prepared foods business accounted for 9% of revenue and 26% of gross profit.

So, in 2022, its prepared foods gross profit was $728 million, or 62% of its $1.17 billion in revenue, compared to an 11.4% gross profit margin for its gas business ($952 million in gross profits divided by $8.32 billion revenue).

As a result of its commitment to prepared foods, Casey’s is the 5th-largest pizza chain in the U.S. In addition, it is working hard to grow Casey’s branded products. As of April 2022, it had 265 Casey’s products in its stores. It currently generates 5% of sales inside its stores from private labels. Its goal is to reach the industry average of 10% within two to three years.

I wouldn’t say that CASY stock is cheap. However, I would say if you buy at current prices, you’re getting growth at a reasonable price.

Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF) recently appointedFactSet Research Systems (NASDAQ:FDS) as its primary market data and technology provider for its U.S. Private Client Group.

“Our collaboration with Raymond James is a clear example of how FactSet’s wealth management solutions give financial advisors the tools needed to drive productivity and efficiency with differentiated content and analytics through a modern and flexible interface,” said Goran Skoko, Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Advisory Solutions at FactSet.

As part of its relationship, FactSet has virtually rolled out 7,500 advanced wealth workstations to Raymond James advisors across the U.S. It’s a win/win business relationship.

These relationships have enabled it to grow revenues and adjusted earnings for 41 and 25 consecutive years, respectively. FactSet has increased its profits yearly since becoming a public company in June 1996.

So far in fiscal 2022, FactSet has increased revenues by 14.0% to $1.34 billion while boosting free cash flow by 8.4% to $350.97 million.

Acuity Brands (AYI) aculty signage (AYI) stocks to buy

Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com

Shares Outstanding:32.71 million

Market Capitalization: $5.84 billion

5-Year Cumulative Return: 1.05%

If a company is cursed, I would put Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) at the top of the list. Acuity is one of the largest providers of lighting solutions in North America. In August 2017, I included Acuity in an article recommending seven stocks to buy with a $2,000 start.

Since National Service Industries spun it off in December 2001, AYI stock has gained 1,478%. However, it’s been downhill since September 2016, when it hit an all-time high of over $275.

The argument can be made that the demand for its stock doesn’t merit any stock splits. The stock’s average daily volume is 268,000 shares, less than 1% of its public float.

Acuity reported healthy third-quarter 2022 results in late June that included an 18% increase in sales to $$1.1 billion and a 30% jump in EPS to $3.05, from $2.37 a year earlier. Both its operating segments — Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls (ABL) and Intelligent Spaces Group (ISG) — sales and profits in the quarter.

Equally important, it repurchased $405.1 million of its stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2022 at an average price of $176.13. At or below its current share price, management believes the shares are worth more.

The company’s CEO, Neil Ashe, joined Acuity in January 2020. Ashe was CEO of Walmart’s (NYSE:WMT) Global eCommerce & Technology unit from January 2012 through January 2017. He’s a highly accomplished executive reviving the company’s fortunes.

Its best days are still ahead of it.

Shares Outstanding:47.23 million

Market Capitalization: $5.48 billion

5-Year Cumulative Return: 4.42%

As with Acuity Brands, Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) has been in a significant slump in recent years.

It flatlined over those five years but not without much volatility thrown into the mix. On three occasions, OLED jumped over $200, only to fall below $150. The most recent example started in January 2021 before bottoming in June.

OLED manufactures organic light emitting diode (hence, the OLED ticker) materials and technologies. It sells OLED materials to manufacturers of mobile phones, televisions, tablets, and other display applications. The company also licenses its technology to those manufacturers. Universal Display has more than 5,500 global patents on this technology.

In Q2 2022, its material sales accounted for 53% of its $136.56 million in revenue; its royalty and license fees accounted for 44%, and its contract research services made up the remaining 3%.

Inflation bit into its margins in the quarter. Its gross margin on material sales was 65%, 600 basis points less than a year ago. However,  due to the licensing revenues being nearly all profits, its operating margin in the quarter was 39%.

Trading its way out of recent weakness, now is an excellent time to buy, with or without any stock splits.

Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) Image of JLL building

Shares Outstanding:47.92 million

Market Capitalization: $8.42 billion

5-Year Cumulative Return: 47.14%

The global real estate services company was hit hard by Covid-19. It generates significant revenue from its office leasing services. Demand for those services fell dramatically over the past two-and-a-half years.

However, that’s only a small piece of what Jones Lang LaSalle (NYSE:JLL) does to make money. It also helps investors and operators buy, sell, and finance real estate, provides property and facility management, offers project development services, consults businesses on workplace strategies, and provides real estate asset management.

In the second quarter, except for its LaSalle real estate asset management business, all five of its operating segments grew revenues by more than 20%, with decent increases in adjusted EBITDA.

The company’s revenue rose 21% in the quarter to $5.3 billion, with $2.1 billion from fees. Its adjusted EPS was $4.48 during the quarter, 9% higher than a year ago.

In the second quarter, JLL repurchased almost $300 million of its stock — up from $38 million a year earlier — at an average price of $212.96 a share. Its share price has fallen dramatically in the third quarter.

“The growth was broad-based across regions and concentrated in the office and industrial sectors,” stated CFO Karen Brennan in its Q2 2022 conference call. “Office sector fee revenue growth outpaced the global office market volume by approximately 500 basis points. Industrial factor fee revenue growth remained strong, up 37%.”

JLL currently trades at 0.43x sales, one of its lowest P/S multiples in the past decade. It will continue to experience some difficulties in office leasing, but long-term, this is a good entry point.

* Indexes up: Dow 0.50%, S&P 0.61%, Nasdaq 0.92% (Adds comment; updates prices, details)

By Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Devik Jain

Aug 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Wednesday with megacap growth stocks leading gains after a tech selloff in the last few sessions, ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference this week.

All 11 major S&P 500 sectors advanced in mid-day trading, with information technology, consumer discretionary and communication services stocks up between 0.4% and 1.1%.

Boosting the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Tesla Inc gained 1.6% ahead of its stock split, while Intuit Inc rose 6.1% after the accounting software maker forecast upbeat fiscal 2023 revenue.

Banks rose 0.6%, on track to snap their five day slump.

The major Wall Street indexes posted losses in the past three sessions after a summer rally was halted by growing concerns of a hawkish stance by the Fed, an energy crisis in Europe and signs of economic slowdown in China.

Investor focus will be on the Jackson Hole symposium which begins on Thursday and remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell the day after for clues on whether the central bank can achieve a ""soft landing"".

""Markets are probably going to be in a holding pattern over the next couple of days ... all eyes are on Friday and what Powell is going to say in his speech,"" said Adam Phillips, managing director of portfolio strategy at EP Wealth Advisors.

""Powell is likely to deliver a hawkish message where he just sticks to the script of saying that the risk of doing too little in fighting inflation far outweighs the risk of doing too much.""

Traders are split between expecting a 50-basis point hike and a 75-basis point hike by the U.S. central bank.

Story continues

Markets had bounced back from bear market lows on better-than-expected results from corporate America and data suggesting that inflation may have peaked, but fears of an aggressive Fed snapped the summer rally last week.

The S&P 500 has recovered 14% from its mid-June lows. The benchmark index will end the year a little above its current level, according to a Reuters poll.

Meanwhile, surveys on Tuesday showed the global economy is increasingly at risk of sliding into recession as consumers faced with generation-high inflation rein in spending, while central banks are tightening policy aggressively.

At 11:51 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 162.91 points, or 0.50%, at 33,072.50, the S&P 500 was up 24.99 points, or 0.61%, at 4,153.72, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 113.34 points, or 0.92%, at 12,494.64.

President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that the U.S. government will forgive $10,000 in student loans for many debt-saddled college-goers, a move that could boost support for his fellow Democrats in the November congressional elections but also may fuel inflation.

Nordstrom Inc tumbled 18.7% after the retailer cut its annual revenue and profit forecasts, a sign that inflation was squeezing consumer spending on its high-end clothing and footwear.

Chipmaker Nvidia Inc rose 1.2%, while Salesforce Inc gained 2.6%, ahead of their quarterly results after the bell.

649,3 Cathie Wood Stocks to Buy for Huge Growth Potential,"One of the most prominent growth investors of our time is Cathie Wood. Founder of the ARK Invest group of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Wood has targeted high-growth companies tilted toward innovation as her focus. Accordingly, many growth investors are constantly digesting which Cathie Wood stocks may have the most potential to rally whenever the next bull market starts.

Indeed, aggressive growth investors aren’t done quite yet. We’ve seen a rather impressive rally off of June lows, driven by a search for value in beaten-up high growth stocks.

Now, whether this continues or not remains to be seen. But what’s for certain is how Cathie Wood is viewed among many growth investors. She’s one of the most aggressive growth-oriented bulls in a market that’s seemingly turned bearish. For those looking to add some risk to their portfolio, taking a look at Cathie Wood’s portfolio is often the first place to start.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Now, not every company Wood holds is of the highest quality. Many have been hit for good reasons. However, there are some picks I think are worth considering. Here are three of my top Cathie Wood stocks in this regard.

ZM Zoom Video Communications $84.43 ROKU Roku $70.65 PATH UiPath $17.50

Cathie Wood Stocks: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building

Among Cathie Wood’s largest portfolio positions is Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM). The stock currently has a portfolio weighting of 10.4% in Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK). Accordingly, next to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Zoom has clearly been a high-conviction pick for the growth fund manager.

Much of this bullish view appears to be tied to Zoom’s underlying technology. This is a company that’s taken a modern approach to innovation and technological architecture. Its previously launched Zoom IQ for Sales products, and Zoom Contact Center saw some excellent initial uptake. Additionally, Zoom Phone reported milestone results, hitting a record number of licenses sold this past quarter, with an increase of more than 100% in this division on a year-over-year (YOY) basis alone.

Story continues

As a leading video conferencing technology provider, Zoom has certainly seen incredible growth in recent years. Much of this has been due to necessity, with many workplaces becoming fully remote. However, with a mass return to the office, many doubt this company’s ability to grow in the future. That’s a fair assessment, given Zoom’s reduced growth rates of late.

That said, for those thinking long-term who believe hybrid or remote work is here to stay, Zoom is an excellent long-term bet. At this valuation, I think the stock is worth a look at the very least.

Roku (ROKU) ROKU Stock Will Continue Benefitting From the TCL Partnership

Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com

Another large weighting for Wood is streaming play Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). A more speculative bet, Roku also surged as a pandemic darling. Everything streaming-related was “in,” with investors looking for the highest-leverage plays on growth at a time when at-home entertainment was king.

Now, with movie theaters fully open and pandemic restrictions largely gone, the entertainment landscape has shifted. Like Zoom, Roku’s valuation has taken a beating. Many, including myself, would agree that this was probably warranted. Indeed, Roku’s valuation at its pandemic highs was unsustainable – that much is clear.

However, at these lower levels, there’s a compelling argument to be made for Roku. The ability for users to easily switch from cable television to streaming without upgrading their in-home tech may become more enticing, should we be heading into a recession. Notably, this company isn’t only a domestic play. Roku operates in approximately 20 countries, albeit with a North American focus.

Could ROKU stock have more downside from here? Potentially. However, at some level, even the least-favored stocks start to look attractive. This is one I’m keeping on my radar for now.

Cathie Wood Stocks: UiPath (PATH) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).

Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com

Finally, we have UiPath (NASDAQ:PATH). I’ve been following this automation solutions provider stock for some time. Like the other names on this list, UiPath’s valuation surged to levels that clearly overshot the company’s potential during the last bull market rally.

That said, I like its overall business model. UiPath’s end-to-end platform that helps companies automate mundane tasks is worth considering. The company’s focus on artificial intelligence tools to manage, build and run operations across many departments of large organizations could take off over time.

The question many investors have is how long this transition will take. While the company has seen some impressive growth during recent boom years, it’s unclear how loose corporations will be with their capital spending plans. While UiPath offers much in terms of productivity, these solutions aren’t cheap. Accordingly, should we be headed into a recession, this is a company with some operational risk to consider.

That said, over the long term, I think there’s plenty of structural growth to be had in the automation space. UiPath is a leader in this regard. Accordingly, for those looking for a multi-year bet on innovation and growth, PATH stock is an intriguing option to consider.

By Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Noel Randewich

Aug 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose modestly on Wednesday, supported by gains in Salesforce and Intuit while investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference this week.

Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, eight rose, led by real estate, up 1.06%, followed by a 0.66% gain in consumer discretionary.

Boosting the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Tesla Inc gained almost 1% ahead of its stock split, while Intuit Inc rallied 4.4% after the accounting software maker forecast upbeat fiscal 2023 revenue.

Salesforce Inc climbed 2.5% ahead of the business software seller's quarterly report after the bell, with analysts expecting revenue to grow at its slowest pace in over a year.

The S&P 500 lost ground in the previous three sessions after a summer rally was halted by growing concerns of an aggressive stance by the Fed, an energy crisis in Europe and signs of economic slowdown in China.

Investor are now focused be on the Jackson Hole symposium that begins on Thursday, with remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday potentially providing clues about the pace of future rate hikes and whether the central bank can achieve a ""soft landing"" for the economy.

""The market is biding its time to get more information on the most important things, which are inflation and the Fed's rate path,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.

Traders are divided between expecting a 50-basis point hike and a 75-basis point hike by the U.S. central bank.

Musk is now the least of Twitter's problems

Twitter (TWTR) is having a rough summer. In addition to a lackluster second quarter, it’s battling with Elon Musk over the Tesla CEO's decision to back out of buying the social media company. But matters got exponentially worse for the blue bird on Tuesday, when reports came out that its former security chief Peiter “Mudge” Zatko filed a whistleblower complaint suggesting Twitter is a security trainwreck.

Zatko's report, filed in July with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice, and Federal Trade Commission, contends that Twitter disincentivized employees from determining the total number of bots on the platform in favor of growing monetizable daily active users (mDAU), CNN and The Washington Post reported. The firm asserts that less than 5% of those accounts are bots. Zatko, meanwhile, says that Twitter doesn’t understand how many bots are on the platform in general.

What’s more, Zatko claims half of Twitter employees had access to sensitive user data, and that the company hired representatives of India’s government who could access user data without their knowledge.

Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usershttps://t.co/Y2t0QMuuyn

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2022

While the Musk saga has been a drag for Twitter, if Zatko’s claims hold true, the company could face an array of lawsuits from shareholders claiming the social media network lied about its security and operations. It could also get hit with fines from regulators. More damaging, Twitter could end up shedding advertisers if they deem the company untrustworthy.

Story continues

“Twitter has another potential problem, and it isn't Musk,” Erik Gordon, clinical assistant professor at The University of Michigan Ross School of Business, told Yahoo Finance. “It's other shareholders who claim that they were hurt and claim that Twitter's statements, disclosures amounted to misrepresentation under securities law.”

Twitter’s bot problems run deeper than its battle with Musk

In October, Twitter will try to convince a Delaware court to force Musk to buy the company. Musk, meanwhile, hopes to prove that Twitter misled him about how many bots the platform has.

There are some key nuances to the arguments, though. Twitter has repeatedly said that it estimates that less than 5% of its mDAUs are bots. Musk, meanwhile, says Twitter hasn’t provided enough information about how many bots are on the platform and that the number could be far more than 5% — as much as 20% of mDAUs. This matters because bots don’t see ads and, therefore, can’t make money for the company.

Zatko claims that Twitter doesn't know how many of its total users are spam or bot accounts, and its employees are disincentivized to find out. But he doesn't challenge Twitter's assertion that less than 5% of its mDAUs are bots.

Instead, Zatko claims, Twitter prioritizes growing its mDAUs at the expense of culling bots from Twitter's overarching user numbers beyond mDAUs. The whistleblower further asserts that Twitter executives don’t want to know how many bots are on the service, because it could impact how advertisers and shareholders view the company.

“[CEO Parag] Agrawal’s tweets and Twitter’s previous blog posts misleadingly imply that Twitter employs proactive, sophisticated, systems to measure and block spam bots,” lawyers representing Zatko wrote in a letter to the SEC, DOJ, and FTC. “Mudge discovered the reality: mostly outdated, unmonitored, simple scripts plus overworked, inefficient, understaffed, and reactive human teams.”

A Twitter spokesperson reiterated that the company fully stands by its prior statements about the percentage of bot and spam accounts on the service.

But if Zatko's claims are accurate, advertisers and shareholders alike could seek to ditch the company out of fear that the true amount of bots is far higher than their worst fears.

Shareholders could pummel Twitter with lawsuits

User numbers and bots are just part of the trouble Zatko’s revelations could stir up for Twitter. If his allegations are true, Twitter could face a series of shareholder lawsuits and its executive lineup could be forced out of the door.

According to Zatko, Twitter has never complied with a 2011 FTC settlement that required the company to establish a comprehensive security program to protect user data and prevent the platform from being exploited. Further, Zatko says, Twitter was never on track to meet those requirements.

A Twitter spokesperson refuted Zatko's claims saying, ""While we haven’t received a copy of any specific allegations, what we’ve seen so far is a narrative about our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and lacks important context. This will not distract us from the critical work we do to safeguard the privacy and data of our customers.""

Some of Zatko's more egregious allegations include the claim that 30% of employee devices had software and security updates disabled, and that Twitter never installed management software on employees’ smartphones that had access to corporate systems. If true, that would mean Twitter, one of the world’s best-known social networks, wasn’t even following the most basic level of cybersecurity preparedness.

And, if Zatko’s accusation that Twitter made misrepresentations to the FTC about those issues, the company could face steep fines.

“If, in fact, they were not reporting the full details to the FTC...that's a big issue that they have to deal with,” said TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.

It’s not just the FTC, though. If Zatko’s claims pan out, Twitter could also face a cavalcade of lawsuits from disgruntled shareholders claiming the company purposely misled them.

“There's a whole stable full of plaintiffs’ securities lawyers who…have paralegals scanning the news all day, looking for things that they could file lawsuits about claiming securities fraud,” Gordon said. “So I think the whistleblower allegations, whether they're true or false, are fresh meat for the security plaintiffs. Twitter is going to be fighting off lots of these securities law class action suits.”

As for Twitter’s executive team, they could end up marching toward the exit if what Zatko says is true. After all, how can you trust the leaders of a company if they’ve lied to shareholders and regulators?

“I think if there's any traction to the whistleblower allegations, then Twitter's next move — even if they win the Musk suit, if they lose the Musk suit — is you throw out the people who are tainted by your problem,” Gordon said. “If your problem is questionable numbers, anybody who was involved with questionable numbers, gets tossed out and you bring in new people and you say to the advertisers, you say to shareholders, the scoundrels are gone. You can trust this new team.”

Of course, none of that is a foregone conclusion. Twitter will likely refute Zatko’s claims one by one, and executives may survive all of this. But the damage to Twitter and its reputation may already be done.

655,7 Stocks for Investors Over 30 to Buy and Hold,"Investing in equities can be rewarding if it is paired with discipline and research. As Peter Lynch points out, “stocks aren’t lottery tickets. Behind every stock is a company. If the company does well, over time the stocks do well.” The idea is to buy and hold stocks of high-quality businesses.

Starting early is often another important factor for success. Warren Buffett purchased his first stock at the age of 11. Peter Lynch “started caddying at 11.” However, these are exceptional cases in the world of investing. This article intends to discuss quality stocks for investors who are 30 and older.

Before building a portfolio, investors need to clearly define the objectives. An obvious goal is to generate returns from stocks that beat inflation. This helps in boosting purchasing power. Also, when looking at stocks for investors over 30, a big objective is often retirement planning.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The focus is therefore on non-speculative stocks that investors can hold for years. I would ideally look at a portfolio that has a mix of dividend stocks and growth stocks.

Dividend stocks will lower the portfolio beta and provide regular cash flows. Starting early will allow investors to plough back these cash flows into stocks. Growth stocks, over time, can potentially become blue-chip stocks. These are the stocks that will magnify portfolio returns.

Let’s dive into these seven stocks for investors over 30.

Stocks for Investors Over 30: Apple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.

I would recommend Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock for any long-term portfolio. There are several reasons to remain invested in this tech innovator.

First and foremost, Apple’s core business is a cash-flow machine. In the years to come, investors will benefit from dividend growth and share repurchases. Just for Q3 2022, the company returned $28 billion to shareholders.

Furthermore, Apple is spreading its wings. Segments like wearables and services have witnessed strong growth. With a robust cash buffer, Apple also plans entry into electric vehicles (EVs). In the next few years, there will be multiple segments that contribute to free cash flows.

Story continues

It’s also worth noting that Apple has made acquisitions worth $28.51 billion over the years. Acquisitions have also ensured that the company maintains an innovation edge.

From a valuation perspective, AAPL stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.5. Valuations are attractive, and the stock is likely to be a long-term value creator.

Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stock is among Warren Buffett’s top holdings. Even after a rally of 67% in the last 12 months, the 3.6% dividend yield looks attractive for fresh exposure.

Goldman Sachs commodity analyst Jeff Currie recently opined that food and energy prices will trend higher in the coming quarters. If this holds true, CVX stock is likely to rally further.

From a long-term perspective, Chevron is attractive considering the company’s low break-even assets. Considering current oil prices, Chevron is positioned to report operating cash flow (OCF) in excess of $30 billion for 2022.

Further, Chevron also expects to invest $15 to $17 billion annually over the next few years. This will ensure steady production and a healthy reserves replacement ratio.

The company also has a strong balance sheet with a net-debt ratio of 10.8%. This provides ample room for aggressive investments and potential acquisitions. Overall, CVX stock looks positioned to reward investors through upside and robust dividends in the coming years.

Stocks for Investors Over 30: Tesla (TSLA) A person walks past the storefront of a Tesla store with several vehicles visible behind a glass door

The EV segment is likely to remain a key investment theme in coming years. Various countries have ambitious targets in terms of EV adoption. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the best investment picks from the EV sector for the next decade. The company is likely to maintain its leadership position even with increasing competition.

A big reason to like Tesla is the company’s ability to generate robust cash flows with operating leverage. For the first half of 2022, Tesla reported operating cash flow of $6.3 billion. This implies an annualized OCF potential of $12.6 billion. As healthy cash flows continue, Tesla will be positioned to make big investments in product development and manufacturing.

In terms of growth, the company’s is considering building another Gigafactory in Indonesia. In the next few years, an investment in India also seems to be on the cards. The best part of growth from the European Gigafactory is still to come.

Tesla also has a lineup of new vehicles that include the Cybertruck, Roadster and Tesla Semi. Overall, there is clear growth and cash flow upside. The correction for year-to-date 2022 therefore presents a good opportunity for investment in TSLA stock.

Pfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock

Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com

I am also including Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) in my list of stocks for investors over 30. A big reason is that PFE stock trades at a forward P/E of 7.5. Additionally, the stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.3%. Considering the valuations, there is ample room for upside besides regular cash flows for investors.

I also believe that Pfizer is positioned for steady growth and cash flow upside in the coming decade. It’s worth noting that as of August 2022, Pfizer has a product pipeline of 104 drug candidates. As these drugs are commercialized, there is ample room for growth.

Pfizer has also been active on the acquisition front. This has deepened the company’s product pipeline. In 2021, Pfizer generated $29.9 billion in free cash flows. With a strong cash buffer, significant investments in research and further acquisitions seem likely.

Amid economic uncertainties, it makes sense to hold a low-beta stock like Pfizer in your portfolio. Also, the company’s growth is largely immune from economic shocks.

Stocks for Investors Over 30: Rivian (RIVN) The back of a silver Rivian pick-up truck.

Source: Miro Vrlik Photography / Shutterstock.com

Among growth stocks, I am bullish on Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) for multi-fold returns potential. In May 2022, RIVN stock had slipped to lows of $19.30. Since then, the stock has trended significantly higher. I believe that the uptrend is likely to sustain.

For Q2 2022, Rivian produced and delivered 4,401 and 4,467 vehicles, respectively. Further, the company has reaffirmed guidance for production of 25,000 vehicles in 2022.

The key point here is that the company is still at an early growth stage. Rivian will be ramping up production capacity to 600,000 vehicles at its plants. Once deliveries accelerate, there is significant room for growth.

It’s also worth noting that Rivian reported pre-orders of 90,000 R1 vehicles as of May 2022. The initial backlog is encouraging, and as the backlog swells, RIVN stock is likely to trend higher. At some point in time, expansion beyond the U.S. is also in the cards. That’s another catalyst for growth in terms of deliveries.

Newmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen

Even with contractionary monetary policies, I remain bullish on gold for the long term. Factors like inflation, a potential recession and geo-political tensions are all positive for the precious metal.

Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock has corrected by 35% in the last six months. This seems like a good long-term accumulation opportunity for a stock with an attractive dividend yield of 5%.

From a financial perspective, Newmont has a robust balance sheet with net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA of 0.3 as of Q2 2022. With a strong cash buffer and an annualized free cash flow visibility of $2 billion, there is ample room for value creation.

Newmont is also attractive considering the fact that the company has gold reserves of 96 million ounces. The reserves will help Newmont sustain production well into the 2040s.

Newmont expects to reduce all-in sustaining costs to $800 to $900 an ounce in the next few years. Even if gold trades around $2,000 an ounce, the company is positioned to deliver robust free cash flows in the coming years.

I therefore believe that Newmont will continue to create shareholder value through dividend growth and share repurchasing. Further, at current valuations, there seems to be opportunity for upside.

Stocks for Investors Over 30: Costco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.

For any long-term portfolio, holding one or more retail stocks makes sense. The consumption sector remains the key driving force of the U.S. economy. Retail spending happens to be a key component of consumption spending.

Recently, retail stocks have been under pressure due to inflation. However, dips provide an opportunity for long-term exposure. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is one stock that’s worth considering.

Even with inflationary headwinds, Costco has been delivering strong results. It’s not surprising that the stock bounced back quickly after a steep correction.

For the 44 weeks ended July 3, the company reported a 16.9% increase in sales. As the company builds strong omni-channel presence, the e-commerce segment will continue to boost comparable store sales growth.

It’s also worth noting that for the last 12 months, Costco reported $4.1 billion in membership fee revenue. With a strong renewal rate and sustained growth in cardholders, recurring income will continue to swell.

By Noel Randewich and Bansari Mayur Kamdar

Aug 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday, supported by gains in Salesforce and Intuit while investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference this week.

Boosting the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Tesla Inc gained ahead of a stock split, while Intuit Inc rallied after the accounting software maker forecast upbeat fiscal 2023 revenue.

Salesforce Inc climbed ahead of the business software seller's quarterly report after the bell.

The S&P 500 lost ground in the previous three sessions after a summer rally was halted by growing concerns of an aggressive stance by the Fed, an energy crisis in Europe and signs of economic slowdown in China.

Investor are now focused be on the Jackson Hole symposium that begins on Thursday, with remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday potentially providing clues about the pace of future rate hikes and whether the central bank can achieve a ""soft landing"" for the economy.

""The market is biding its time to get more information on the most important things, which are inflation and the Fed's rate path,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.

Traders are divided between expecting a 50-basis point hike and a 75-basis point hike by the U.S. central bank.

President Joe Biden said the U.S. government will forgive $10,000 in student loans for many debt-saddled college-goers, a move that could boost support for his fellow Democrats in the November congressional elections but also may fuel inflation.

Helped by corporate quarterly results that were not as bad as feared, the S&P 500 has recovered 13% from its mid-June lows. The benchmark index is set to end the year a little above its current level, according to strategists recently polled by Reuters.

658,UPDATE 2-Tesla likely must face California agency's race bias lawsuit,"(Adds background on Tesla and on case)

By Daniel Wiessner

Aug 24 (Reuters) - A California state judge on Wednesday said he would likely deny Tesla Inc's bid to dismiss a lawsuit by the state's civil rights agency accusing the electric car maker of widespread race discrimination at an assembly plant.

California Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo in Oakland in a tentative written order rejected Tesla's claims that the lawsuit would be unmanageable because it involves thousands of employees, and that the state Civil Rights Department (CRD) failed to notify the company of all the claims before it sued in February.

During a hearing on Wednesday, Grillo said he needed more time to issue a final decision, according to a representative of Tesla.

California judges often issue tentative written rulings before court hearings. It was not clear when Grillo could issue a final decision.

In the lawsuit filed in February, the CRD said Tesla's flagship Fremont, California, plant was a racially segregated workplace where Black employees were harassed and discriminated against in terms of job assignments, discipline and pay.

Tesla, which has denied wrongdoing, and its lawyers said they had no immediate comment.

A spokesperson for the CRD declined to comment. The agency until last month was called the Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

Austin, Texas-based Tesla is facing a series of race and sex discrimination cases, most involving the Fremont plant. A state judge in April cut a jury verdict for a Black worker who alleged racial harassment from $137 million to $15 million. The plaintiff rejected the reduced award and opted for a new trial, which is scheduled for March 2023.

In its motion to dismiss the CRD's case, Tesla says the agency flouted its obligations under state law by filing the lawsuit without first notifying the company of all of the claims or giving it a chance to settle.

Tesla in June filed a complaint with a different state agency, the California Office of Administrative Law, claiming the CRD's alleged lapses are widespread and the procedures adopted by the agency are unlawful. The OAL earlier this month declined to review Tesla's petition without giving a reason for doing so.

662,Australia Could Power the World and Its Green Ambitions Could Change Everything,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia is finally getting serious about global warming and everyone from oil majors to billionaire mining magnates are looking for a way to capitalize on the transformation.

Signs of change are everywhere on the continent. A new government has been elected, pledging to cut greenhouse-gas emissions faster; the nation’s biggest power grid has a multibillion-dollar plan to dump coal; and some of the country’s richest people who made their fortunes in mining and technology are lining up huge green-energy projects designed to pivot the nation from fossil-fuel king to a global supplier of green energy and the metals needed to build electric vehicles.

Few countries in the world can make such an outsize difference to climate change relative to their population. Australia’s addiction to coal and fossil fuels, both at home and for exports, has made it the largest carbon emitter per capita in the developed world. Yet by one estimate, the vast sunbaked continent could generate 5,000 exajoules of green energy — more than eight times current global demand. Even by more conservative assessments, Australia could power the world.

“We're at a turning point,” said Will Symons, Melbourne-based Asia-Pacific climate and sustainability leader for Deloitte. “The challenge for us is to move at pace and move at scale, and that's going to require new collaborations. Speed is everything.”

For companies including Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc., oil giant BP Plc and a host of Japanese conglomerates, Australia provides more than an opportunity to make a dent in global emissions. As well as a potential source of green energy, it offers a unique platform to develop, test and build technologies thanks to the nation’s climate, minerals and ready-made infrastructure. That combination of resources is especially attractive for companies looking to produce green hydrogen, with funding and export deals pouring in from Germany, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and the UK.

Story continues

Still, the scale of the task is daunting. Australia’s economy has relied on digging out and selling its minerals — especially coal — for over a century. Last year, it mined about 400 million tons of the most-polluting fossil fuel. Yet in a symbol of how the nation is changing, the country’s largest power market this month reached a point where solar briefly overtook coal as the biggest source of electricity.

A big part of the shift is political. The May national election not only put Labor in power, it saw gains for the Green party and several independent lawmakers who campaigned on environmental platforms. New Prime Minister Anthony Albanese followed up his election promises by introducing a Climate Change Bill on July 27 aimed at cutting emissions 43% by 2030 from 2005 levels. “Australia’s open for business for renewable energy, for transmission, for storage, to create hundreds of thousands of jobs,” Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen told Sky News Australia.

In the media, a handful of the nation’s richest people have been grabbing headlines. Mike Cannon-Brookes and mining magnate Andrew Forrest are putting together A$30 billion ($20 billion) in funding to build a 4,200-kilometer (2,600-mile) undersea cable to send solar power to Singapore that could begin construction in 2024.

Forrest, founder of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, the country’s No. 3 iron-ore exporter, plans to make his entire fleet of trucks and trains in the Pilbara mining region carbon-free by 2040, according to regulatory filings. One of the billionaire’s biggest coups this year was to lure Guy Debelle, who had been tipped to become the next governor of Australia’s central bank.

“We haven’t got all the time in the world, we need to be doing something now,” said Debelle, now chief financial officer of Forrest’s clean-energy venture, Fortescue Future Industries, which also plans to start producing 15 million tons a year of green hydrogen by 2030.

The billionaires aren’t the only ones in the country turning green. Oil major BP linked up with green hydrogen firm InterContinental Energy and solar supplier CWP Global to lead what could become one of the world’s biggest clean energy projects — a 26-gigawatt solar and wind farm on a chunk of Western Australia larger than Delaware. The project would pump out 1.6 million tons of hydrogen, or 9 million tons of ammonia a year. Meanwhile Japan received its first shipment this year of Australian carbon-neutral hydrogen made from brown coal on the Suiso Frontier, a purpose-built hydrogen tanker made by Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

“We can be the equivalent of Saudi Arabia in clean energy,” said Murray Shearer, chair and professor of hydrogen and alternative energy at CQ University in Gladstone. “We have all the natural advantages and we need to grab these things before they go somewhere else.”

Australians have more reason than most to worry about global warming and rising sea levels. While Londoners in the UK sweltered through an unusually hot July, in the southern hemisphere summer in January, the seaside town of Onslow in Western Australia saw the mercury rise to 50.7C (123 Fahrenheit), the highest temperature recorded on the continent. Even in the western suburbs of the nation’s largest city, Sydney, summer temperatures regularly melt asphalt. The ‘black summer’ of 2019 and early 2020 saw Australia’s worst bushfires in living memory.

And while the dry, inhospitable interior of the country may be good for mining and solar farms, it means that 9 out of 10 Australians live near the sea, mostly along the country’s eastern coast that was battered by deadly floods this year.

The continent has “absolutely extraordinary potential that’s only just beginning to be realized on the renewable side,” Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and now head of Brookfield Asset Management’s Global Transition Fund, told a Melbourne conference via videolink on July 28. “Seizing that will create more jobs and more opportunity.”

Yet for Australia to capitalize on its clean-energy potential and create enough jobs to replace those lost from the demise of dirty fuel, the nation needs to develop a much wider green ecosystem than it has, one that includes research, startups, skills and especially funding. A Deloitte index of ‘economic complexity,’ which measures diversity in industries and supply chains, ranks Australia 37th, behind China, Russia and India.

One potential advantage is that Australia is also the source of many of the minerals used in green-technology industries such as electric-vehicle batteries and energy storage. The nation supplies more lithium raw materials than any other country, accounting for about three-quarters of Tesla's needs, and has vast troves of other key metals including nickel, cobalt and manganese.

Developing a diverse battery industry that includes more than simply mining would add more than A$3 billion ($2.1 billion) in value and an extra 16,000 jobs by 2030, Accenture said in a report last year. But efforts to leverage that mineral wealth to develop higher-value related industries have been slow. The country's first lithium refinery began production in Kwinana, Western Australia, in May and other sites are under construction, a first step in moving up the value chain.

To move toward the goal of manufacturing lithium-ion cells and batteries — and potentially even reviving auto production — Australia could begin by focusing on specialist areas such as commercial vehicles and energy storage for wind and solar farms, the Accenture study said. Tesla built and installed the world’s first large-scale battery for energy storage in Hornsdale, South Australia, in 2017.

“Australia has the minerals — not just lithium — and also the knowhow and many of the skills to capture the opportunity of this new energy era,” Tesla's Sydney-based chair Robyn Denholm told a conference in the city last month.

Increasing tension between the US and China could also help Australia as Western companies look for alternative suppliers to counter the dominance of China in rechargeable batteries.

A pro-environment government can help by providing investment in education and initial capital to jump-start innovation, and by adjusting regulations to encourage investment in technology and infrastructure, but government spending on green projects is only a tiny amount of what’s needed. Renewable energy agency Arena invested the equivalent of about $1.3 billion in the past decade in more than 600 projects, including 35 hydrogen ventures. By contrast, oil-rich Saudi Arabia last year pledged to spend more than $100 billion over the next 10 years on renewables.

Read: Climate Action to Spur Australian Green Bonds to Record Year

In this year’s A$100 million hydrogen deployment round, Arena expects to reach financial close on two or three of the country’s first large-scale electrolyzers — the devices that split water into hydrogen and oxygen, CEO Darren Miller said in June.

“While a 10 megawatt electrolyzer would indeed be the largest of its kind in Australia so far, we’ve seen the ambition really grow to the extent that large-scale would now be a 300 megawatt electrolyzer — some thirty times larger than those we’re currently working on,” Miller said.

For Australia to turn its energy supertanker around it will need massive investment, both from domestic companies and from abroad. And here it has another advantage: land. Australia and the U.S. are among the few developed nations with huge areas of relatively sparsely populated land that are ideal for solar power all year round where projects can be quickly attached to a power grid with a ready-made market.

Ironically, many of these investments are in traditional mining and fossil-fuel regions because they already have much of the infrastructure and labor needed to operate renewable plants and connect them to the grid.

One key advantage that Australia has could be the ability to pivot some of its biggest environmental offenders into green havens. Gladstone in the country’s north east, currently the world’s fourth-largest coal export terminal, is the site of an investment by Rio Tinto and Japan’s Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. to create sustainable energy and green hydrogen that would help decarbonize the city’s carbon-intensive industries such as cement and aluminum.

“Strategically it works very well to kick off the energy transition in these industrial hubs,” said CQU’s Shearer. “When you do an analysis of where are the cheapest places in Australia to do clean energy — hydrogen in particular — some of them are in Gladstone and the area surrounding it.”

How Australia Is Transforming Grids Away From Coal Power

One area where Australia’s change of heart is most visible and most needed is in research.

From a project at the University of New South Wales that uses old tires and coffee grounds to smelt steel, to Sydney-based HB11 Energy, which was recently awarded A$22 million to develop Australia’s sovereign nuclear fusion program, startups are being founded in new energy and climate-change related industries.

One success story is Brisbane-based Tritium DCFC Ltd., which has almost 7,000 electric vehicle rapid chargers installed in 41 countries, the fastest of which can add 217 miles of driving range in 10 minutes.

“There’s a growing urgency in industry to go green,” said Andrew Horvath, chairman of Star Scientific Ltd., which is working on ways to replace fossil-fuels in power stations with green hydrogen — another example of an effort to leverage the nation’s existing infrastructure by using existing steam turbines. “Why would you throw them away? They’re already connected to the grid,” he said.

Still, there are those who caution against moving too rapidly to dump fossil fuels, arguing that it could lead to high unemployment in some communities and would hurt the economy.

“I think the financial industry has mostly not completely come around to the idea that funding coal is probably not sensible,” Debelle said. He argues that, far from damaging the economy, Australia’s potential green resources give it a competitive advantage.

“We have a great capacity to really do very nicely out of these opportunities,” said Debelle. “It’s good for the economy. It’s got employment opportunities. It’s great from an energy self-sufficiency point of view, but actually the commercials stack up too.”

Meanwhile, the nation’s traditional fossil-fuel and carbon-intensive industries are minting money thanks to the global energy crisis, fanned by Russia’s war in Ukraine. The price of coal for power stations shipped from Newcastle, Asia’s key port for the fuel, surged to a record in June.

But while the Ukraine war is providing a temporary surge in demand — Europe’s biggest economy, Germany, already reactivated some coal-fired power plants to cut dependence on Russian gas — the crisis is also reinforcing the necessity for energy-importing nations to lessen their reliance on a small number of big fossil-fuel exporters.

Pressure from the community, labor unions and businesses who realize the days of dirty fuel are numbered has been building for almost a decade, said Amanda Tattersall, a researcher who is involved in transition projects around Australia. Now the political and economic muscle has arrived to back it up.

“The choice is clear and that choice is about driving forward at pace and scale for Australia to become the clean-energy superpower,” said Deloitte’s Symons. “There is no playbook that we can follow. We need to chart this ourselves.”

663,Twitter Whistle-Blower Will Be Star Witness in Congress,"(Bloomberg) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing featuring testimony from Twitter whistle-blower Peiter “Mudge” Zatko on Sept. 13, the panel’s leaders announced on Wednesday.

The committee said it had subpoenaed Zatko, the company’s former security chief, to appear a day after he went public with allegations that Twitter has failed to adequately protect data on its hundreds of millions of users, leaving their personal information open to hackers and spies.

“Mr. Zatko’s allegations of widespread security failures and foreign state actor interference at Twitter raise serious concerns,” said Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the panel’s top Republican, Chuck Grassley of Iowa.

“If these claims are accurate, they may show dangerous data privacy and security risks for Twitter users around the world,” the senators said in the statement.

The committee plans to investigate further with a full hearing and take additional steps as needed to get to the bottom of the allegations, according to the statement.

Zatko, who oversaw Twitter’s security from 2020 until he was fired six months ago, submitted reports outlining his claims to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. He alleged that Twitter’s head of site integrity told him that the social media company didn’t know how many bots, or automated accounts, are on its platform.

Twitter rejected the whistle-blower’s claims, describing them in a statement as a false narrative “riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies.” Zatko was fired for “ineffective leadership and poor performance,” Twitter said.

John Tye, chief disclosure officer of Whistleblower Aid, which is representing Zatko in the complaint, said Wednesday evening that “Mudge stands by everything in his disclosure, and his career of ethical and effective leadership speaks for itself.”

“The focus should be on the facts laid out in the disclosure, not ad hominem attacks against the whistle-blower,” Tye added.

Legal experts said Zatko’s claims could bolster Elon Musk’s legal case against Twitter. The Tesla Inc. founder, who is seeking to back out of his bid to buy the social media site, is arguing in court that Twitter misled him about the amount of bots and spam on the platform.

Lawmakers on several congressional committees have vowed to investigate Zatko’s claims and have argued that his revelations highlight the need for federal privacy legislation.

Zatko alleged that Twitter prioritized growth over reining in the scourge of spam accounts, and even offered millions of dollars in cash bonuses to executives that increased the number of daily active users. He also claimed the Twitter sales team has continued to misuse phone numbers for targeted advertising, potentially violating its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission.

664,"After-hours movers: Nvidia, Salesforce, Tesla and more","Top trending after-hours tickers on Yahoo Finance:

Salesforce (CRM): Shares fell after the company beat on second-quarter results but cut its full-year revenue forecast to between $30.9 billion and $31 billion. For the second quarter, Salesforce posted adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.19 on revenue of $7.7 billion. RBC Capital Markets Software Equity Analyst Rishi Jaluria told Yahoo Finance that if investors are “willing to weather choppiness over the next couple of quarters as we deal with an uncertain macro environment, I can see a position in which Salesforce becomes a net share gainer over the next 12 to 18 months.”

Tesla (TSLA): Tesla will start trading on a split-adjusted basis tomorrow, after the shareholders voted to approve the 3-for-1 split at a shareholder meeting earlier this month. This is the second time Tesla has split its stock in recent years, the move making shares more accessible to retail traders. Tesla’s stock is up 11.3% in the past six months but off 15.7% this year.

Nvidia (NVDA): Shares dropped in after-hours trading after its third-quarter revenue guidance fell short of the Street’s expectations by $1 billion amid a slowdown in gaming and PC sales. Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang noted in the earnings statement, ""We are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this.” Revenue for the second quarter totaled $6.7 billion while net income for the company fell 72% from a year ago to $656 million.

Snowflake (SNOW): The stock soared 16% after hours following the data-software company’s second-quarter revenue beat and better-than-expected revenue guidance. Sales for the quarter totaled $497.2 million, representing 83% year-over-year growth.

Autodesk (ADSK): Shares jumped after hours after the company boosted its adjusted earnings per share forecast for the year. Autodesk now sees adjusted EPS of $6.52 to $6.71, up from its initial view of $6.43 to $6.66. For the second quarter, Autodesk beat on both the top and bottom lines, posted adjusted EPS of $1.65 on net revenue of $1.24 billion.

665,10 Best Websites To Research Stocks,"In this article, we discuss the 10 best websites to research stocks. If you want to see more websites that offer stock analysis and assist in research, check out the 5 Best Websites To Research Stocks.

Retail investors carry out extensive research to read up on the latest trends in the stock market, familiarize themselves with investing strategies, check out prominent moves of elite hedge funds and smart investors, and educate themselves about the macroeconomic environment, all of which is crucial if they want to compose a robust portfolio. Retail investors are a significant part of the investing community, and there are plenty of online resources available to help them navigate their way around the dynamic stock market.

According to a Reuters report on August 18, retail investors have been increasingly pouring into speculative options trading. Single stock options have had a 10-day average daily trading volume of roughly 25 million contracts, which is the highest level recorded in more than six months. Similarly, there has been a rally in meme stocks, with some of the biggest gainers being Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY), GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC). The latest rise in options trading is an indicator of improved risk appetite among retail investors. However, trading volumes are still down approximately 24% from the record highs of last November.

Despite the tumultuous stock market, retail investors have remained resilient in the face of mass sell-offs, high inflation, recession threats, and global supply disruptions. A July survey by eToro suggests that two-thirds of U.S. investors had unchanged portfolios during the market sell-off, with retail traders being focused on long-term financial gains. As per a BNY Mellon and World Economic Forum Global Retail Investing survey, three-quarters of present retail investors would be more active in the market if they had more avenues to educate themselves about investing, as well as customized and outcome-oriented stock advice. This is where reliable websites to research stocks would be extremely useful, such as Bloomberg, Yahoo! Finance, and Insider Monkey.

One of The Motley Fool’s top picks for 2022, dated August 1, is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). After reports that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will implement an incremental $0.35 per item fee on Fulfilled By Amazon items sold in the U.S. and Canada beginning in mid-October and lasting until mid-January, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak called the move a ""positive signal"" about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s ""confidence in the health of its U.S. seller offering and its consumer"". He maintained an 'Overweight' rating and a $175 price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares on August 17.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 252 hedge funds were bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of June 2022, compared to 271 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 48.6 million shares worth over $5 billion.

In addition to the meme frenzy around Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY), GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), retail investors also back solid plays like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a balanced portfolio.

Here is what Alphyn Capital had to say about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“It is interesting to see how sentiment on Amazon went from positive to negative in one quarter, as it transpired that it too was not as immune to post-covid slowdowns as some, myself included, had expected. However, I feel confident that Amazon, as the apex predator in the e-commerce space, will navigate market softness better than most other retailers. Moreover, once it finishes with its current capex cycle, it will continue to improve margins. Andy Jassy is reportedly spending one-third of his time focused on capacity and supply issues in the retail division.”

9. Bloomberg

Bloomberg is a New York-based privately held company that operates in the technology, fintech, and mass media industries. The company offers financial software and applications for data analytics and equity trading to multiple organizations, in addition to providing tools specializing in electronic trading, hedge funds, portfolio management, private equity, research and analysis, and sales. Bloomberg.com also has a live stock market broadcast. Bloomberg articles are held in high regard, and are often cited by other publications due to the credibility of their sources.

According to a recent Bloomberg report, dated August 22, some of Asia’s biggest funds like Aspex Management (HK) Ltd. and Oasis Management Co. strengthened their positions in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), among other names, in the second quarter of 2022. Deutsche Bank analyst Leo Chiang raised the price target on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) to $160 from $155 on August 22 and kept a 'Buy' rating on the shares. The company's June quarter net income was above market consensus, and adjusted net margins also beat estimates, primarily due to a quicker than anticipated reduction in losses from new initiatives, the analyst told investors. The analyst sees the present valuation as ""defensive,"" and said a rapid macro recovery could offer upside potential.

According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 106 hedge funds were long Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) on June 30, compared to 100 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is one of the leading stakeholders of the company, with roughly 12 million shares worth $1.3 billion.

Here is what Artisan Global Value Fund had to say about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“Alibaba rose 4% during the quarter. We would love to say the share price performance was due to strong operational performance. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The most recent earnings results showed its core e-business still had not returned to growth, primarily due to the difficult retail environment caused by the government’s zero-COVID policy. Alibaba also appears to be losing market share due to its product mix tilted toward apparel and cosmetics, categories currently stalled in this environment. The share price performance this quarter was largely a function of exogenous items—specifically, government actions in the form of stimulus to support the economy and less regulations.

Despite the poor recent results, Alibaba remains a powerful economic engine. It is a global leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, both of which should grow nicely over time. Management has started taking actions to improve profitability, which has been burdened by significant investment in loss-making business ventures. The financial results should improve significantly when China’s economy starts to recover from COVID-19 outbreaks. The shares are incredibly cheap and have some of the highest upside potential in the portfolio. Even embedding significant losses from new ventures, we estimate they are trading at 11X-12X unlevered earnings. In our view, the shares could double, and they still would not be expensive.”

8. CNBC

CNBC’s latest article identified Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of the biggest pre-market movers as of August 22, among others. Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas raised the price target on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to $881 from $815 on August 8 and reaffirmed a 'Buy' rating on the shares. The analyst said that although the macroeconomic backdrop and latest price increases could definitely affect order rates, he believes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s EV momentum and competitive position in terms of manufacturing, materials procurement, and autonomy, is safe on the whole. He observed that given the additional offerings in solar and energy storage, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the biggest sustainability firm.

Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is a notable position holder in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), with 1.4 million shares worth more than $1 billion. Overall, 72 hedge funds were bullish on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at the conclusion of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 80 funds in the prior quarter.

Here is what GMO LLC had to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“To put the demand growth for clean energy materials into perspective, let’s look at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). At its Battery Day last year, Tesla projected three terawatt hours of lithium-ion battery capacity needed in 2030 for the EVs and storage they expect to produce. To reach this target, Tesla alone would gobble up approximately 75% of the world’s current nickel production and four times the world’s current lithium production. These numbers are astounding enough, but when one considers that EVs currently represent just 15% of global nickel demand and about 45% of lithium demand and that Tesla will likely be producing only a small proportion of the world’s EVs in 2030, the implications are staggering. Clean energy materials companies will make a lot more money in the decades to come than they ever have both because they will be selling a lot more metric tons of material and because there are certain to be shortages where supply can’t keep up with the rapidly growing demand.”

7. Morningstar

Morningstar, Inc. (NASDAQ:MORN), a Chicago-based financial services firm, offers investment research and investment management services. The company operates a website where it discusses advisor insights, personal finance, market volatility, retirement planning, savings, and best investments.

On August 2, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) reported its Q2 results, posting earnings per share of $3.16 and revenue of $10.7 billion, outperforming Wall Street's consensus estimates by $0.14 and $962 million, respectively. The company's Q2 revenue increased by 78.62% on a year-over-year basis.

According to Insider Monkey’s June quarter data, 66 hedge funds were bullish on Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), compared to 67 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder of the company, with 159 million shares worth $9.3 billion.

Like Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY), GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is one of the stocks trending on the stock market.

Here is how Smead Capital Management viewed Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“For the quarter, our best-performing stocks were Continental Resources (CLR), Merck (MRK) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY). Despite a steep sell-off in June in the oil and gas stocks, two of our oil stocks made the quarterly list.

If you are wondering how we are outperforming the S&P 500 Index in the first half of the year, look no further than our top three performers. Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Continental Resources (CLR) and ConocoPhillips (COP) soared in value and were barely represented in the S&P 500 Index. To quote Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, “We are in the first quarter on higher energy prices!””

6. The Wall Street Journal

The WSJ website also has WSJ Money, Streetwise, and Intelligent Investor segments. WSJ Pro provides information on bankruptcy, central banking, private equity, and venture capital.

On August 16, The Wall Street Journal reported that Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) shares climbed higher despite liquidity concerns. Wedbush analyst Seth Basham downgraded Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) to 'Underperform' from 'Neutral' on August 18 with an unchanged price target of $5. A ""key support leg"" for the stock has been removed with activist investor Ryan Cohen indicating his intent to liquidate his entire 11.8% beneficial ownership in Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY), the analyst told investors. The analyst said the company needs more financing to strengthen its balance sheet and regain supplier confidence due to its cash burn.

Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a notable stakeholder of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY), with 2.30 million shares worth $11.5 million. Overall, 14 hedge funds were long Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) at the end of Q2, compared to 15 funds in the earlier quarter.

Here is what Miller Value Partners Income Strategy had to say about Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“Bed Bath & Beyond 5.165% 08/2044 declined 67.4% in the period. Bed Bath & Beyond reported 4Q21 sales of $2.05 billion, down 22% Y/Y, missing consensus of $2.08 billion. The company lost $0.92 per share in the quarter, down from 4Q20 adjusted EPS of $0.40, below analyst expectations for EPS of $0.03. Management noted supply chain disruptions and the Omicron variant led to inventory availability challenges, which had an estimated sales impact of $175 million, or 8.5% of 4Q21 net sales, and a 400 basis points (bps) Y/Y contraction in 4Q21 adjusted gross margin to 28.8%, driven by product cost increases and higher than anticipated freight and shipping costs. Additional headwinds in the quarter included general weakness in the retail segment, highlighted by big earnings misses from Walmart and Target, along with Moody’s downgrading Bed Bath’s corporate family rating from B1 to B2. The ratings agency cited increased execution risk of the company’s strategic turnaround initiatives and ongoing supply chain issues weighing on the company’s market share and profitability going forward as the main drivers for the downgrade. However, Moody’s maintained a stable outlook for the retailer due to the financial flexibility provided by the company’s liquidity position and low level of funded debt.”

(NASDAQ:TSLA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), while adding to its Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stake in the second quarter of 2022. On August 18, Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman raised the price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to $150 from $145 and reiterated an 'Overweight' rating on the shares. The analyst expects Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to stabilize from the latest margin compression in the second half of the company's FY23, with a solid opportunity in FY24 as top-line momentum prevails. He sees a strong chance to balance longer-term investments with short-term returns despite near-term challenges in a tough inventory and mix backdrop.

Other important subreddits for stock research include r/investing, r/stocks, r/biotech, and r/pennystocks. Reddit is one of the top websites for stock research.

Story continues

WallStreetBets has created multiple meme stocks over the years, as Redditors are a strong community and can easily drive up prices and influence the stock market. One of the most popular meme stocks of 2021 was GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), and Redditors are still actively purchasing the shares. GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is a Texas-based provider of games and entertainment products. 21 hedge funds reported owning stakes in GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) as of June 30, down from 31 funds a quarter earlier. Mason Capital Management held one of the leading positions in the company, comprising 518,445 shares worth over $19 million.

Here is what Bronte Capital Amalthea Fund had to say about GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“Gamestop is a retailer of video games on DVD ROM trying hard (and maybe with some success) to reinvent itself as an alternative computer game distributor. The company raised enough money that bankruptcy is not an immediately likely outcome. (GME would have gone bankrupt except for the willingness of largely retail investors to provide them with much more cash.)

Both have bad financial results. Gamestop’s last financial results were terrible. And both stocks more than doubled very rapidly in March from market caps that were absurd to market caps that are more absurd. We are of course completely aware that they can double again and again after that. Their valuations are absurd but if you double the price they are not twice as absurd. They are just similarly disconnected from reality.

The reason we want to talk about them is that it is indicative of what is going on. Gamestop, the most meme of all stocks, announced a possible stock split and the stock, after market that day, traded up 17 percent. We could joke that every child knows that cutting a pizza into more slices yields more pizza. But in this market, not accepting that stock splits add value is a recipe for losing money.”

3. Seeking Alpha

Seeking Alpha is an Israel-based crowd-sourced company that provides financial commentary and analysis. Seeking Alpha is an equity research platform that publishes research and articles by industry experts on stocks, exchange traded funds, and investment strategies. The company was founded in 2004 by David Jackson, a former Wall Street analyst.

On August 22, Seeking Alpha reported that Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) stock dropped about 8% as the company posted a third-quarter outlook that suggests its COVID-related exponential growth may be slowing down. Citi analyst Tyler Radke downgraded Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) to 'Sell' from 'Neutral' with a $91 price target on August 16. He sees new hindrances in Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) sustaining growth, including higher competition from Microsoft Teams and the macro backdrop impacting small to medium-sized firms. He made ""significant cuts"" to his estimates for Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM).

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 44 hedge funds were long Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) at the end of Q2, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. ARK Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 9.5 million shares worth over $1 billion.

Here is what Horos Asset Management had to say about Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Here we can distinguish three major groups. First, those companies without earnings that had convinced investors of their great future growth prospects, pushing up their valuations to irrational levels. A clear example of this, which we mentioned almost two years ago (see here) is Zoom Video Communications (“Zoom”), whose market cap exceeded that of companies such as IBM or came close to that of Cisco Systems. Well, from the time we wrote about this odd situation until today, Zoom shares have collapsed nearly 80%.

Therefore, if interest rates rise (or are expected to rise), company valuations are negatively impacted. This is especially true for those businesses that generate little cash today and the market expects them to generate a lot of cash in the future. Hence the severe losses in companies that promised a lot of cash generation in the future (such as Zoom).”

Insider Monkey’s article from August 22 reveals the 10 stocks that Warren Buffett is not giving up on despite their year-to-date losses. One of those stocks is Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), a Connecticut-based broadband connectivity and cable operator company. In Q2, Warren Buffett owned 3.8 million shares of the company, worth about $1.8 billion. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 68 hedge funds were long Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) at the end of June, down from 73 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 790,325 shares worth $370 million.

Here is what Andvari Associates had to say about Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:

“Regarding Liberty Broadband, Andvari has owned it for the last 7+ years primarily because of its large stake in cable company Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). Given that Liberty also traded at a wide discount to its own net asset value, Andvari saw this as an even cheaper way to own Charter. We sold Liberty because we saw (too slowly) a violation of one of the core parts to our investment thesis: pricing power at Charter was not as great as we imagined. Charter has not been able to raise prices in line with inflation. To add insult to injury, the trade association for the U.S. cable industry started proudly advertising about how internet price increases have remained far behind the rate of inflation.”

670,Tesla Split Will Struggle to Feed $280 Billion Rally: Tech Watch,"(Bloomberg) -- After a $280 billion rally since late May, Tesla Inc. is using a trusted method for fueling further gains. It may not pan out like that.

The electric vehicle maker’s second stock split in as many years takes effect when US markets open on Thursday, a move aimed at bolstering an already strong retail investor base. The previous one in 2020 was among a number of factors that drove the stock up more than eightfold that year.

The latest split comes close on the heels of similar moves by Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc., whose subsequent stock performances have suggested this once dependable tactic to boost valuation is losing its potency amid the ravages of a bear market. Amazon shares fell more than 10% from when it announced the split to the day it became effective, while Alphabet lost 21% between those events.

“The stock split smoke-and-mirror boost is much more prevalent in a bull market when retail investors rush into stocks,” said Greg Martin, managing director and co-founder of Rainmaker Securities. “In bear markets retail investors tend to be less involved and the institutional players would never be fooled by a stock split to move into a stock.”

Shares of the Elon Musk-led company are down 12% since late-March when it declared its plan for a split, a far cry from 2020 when the stock surged 60% from announcement to the last close prior to the beginning of split-adjusted trading. Tesla traded at $303.04 as of 4:12 a.m. in New York premarket trading, up from a prior close of $297.10 when adjusted for the split.

Riskier growth stocks like Tesla have borne the brunt of a souring equities market mood this year amid the threat of a recession. The stock is down 16% year-to-date, headed for its first annual decline since 2016. And having rallied 42% through Wednesday’s close since hitting a year low on May 24, the rebound has hit a wall in August as broader enthusiasm among retail investors has started to flag again.

Story continues

According to Vanda Research, investors tend to “drastically scale back” purchases of stocks in the weeks after a split takes effect. The firm doesn’t believe it will be any different for Tesla this time round, it said in a note.

Highly Valued

In addition to a tentative investor mood, the stock’s eye-watering valuation may also make gains harder to come by. Tesla trades at about 57 times forward earnings estimates compared with 17 times for the S&P 500 Index. And the average analyst price target implies a decline of about 3% over the next 12 months, even as the benchmark index is expected to rise more than 15%.

“There is a lot of hope, speculation, hero worship in the current valuation,” said Catherine Faddis, chief investment officer of Grace Capital. In order to buy the stock right now, an investor needs to believe that in 10 years Tesla will have revenue of $800 billion, Faddis said, almost 10 times estimates for this year.

Then there is the company’s litany of challenges -- production troubles in China, the persisting supply-chain shortages across the automotive industry and high raw material costs, as well as Musk’s litigation with Twitter Inc. -- that can dull the shine of any potential exuberance driven by the split.

Still, Tesla’s strong popularity with the mom-and-pop investing crowd can ensure a short-term bump in the stock, if wider investor sentiment improves again.

“A strong retail following is the key ingredient for a stock split to make a difference,” said Martin of Rainmaker Securities, adding that Tesla’s timing for the split may prove to be lucky as the climate act will “create substantial new demand for electric vehicles and Tesla is the market leader in the EV market.”

Tech Chart of the Day

When Tesla executes its split there will be only eight Nasdaq 100 components with stocks priced at more than $500. This year’s market selloff, coupled with a series of splits, has meant that the number of companies with share prices exceeding $500 has halved from the beginning of the year.

672,U.S. Stocks Rise as Investors Await Fed Confab,"By Liz Moyer

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks were trading higher after snapping a three-day losing streak on Wednesday as investors looked to the Federal Reserve’s meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., later today.

At 10:52 ET (14:52 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 146 points or 0.4% while the S&P 500 rose 1% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.3%.

Fed officials including Chair Jerome Powell are expected to speak this weekend and likely will reaffirm the central bank’s commitment to lowering inflation, though investors will be parsing the words for any hints about the Fed’s next move on interest rates.

Many expect the Fed will raise rates again in September by a half point rather than the 0.75 percentage point increases it made in June and July.

Reuters reported that Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said it was too soon to predict how much the Fed will hike rates because data on inflation and the labor market will come out before the meeting.

Gross domestic product shrank at a 0.6% annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said, publishing its second estimate. A previous estimate had second quarter GDP falling at a 0.9%.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dipped 0.6% after they began trading after splitting 3 for 1 Wednesday evening.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which makes chips that are popular with videogamers, rose 2.6% after it forecast a sharp drop in revenue for the current quarter on declining sales.

Oil fell. Crude Oil WTI Futures were down 0.7% to $94.23 a barrel, and Brent Oil Futures crude fell 0.3% to $100.93 a barrel. Gold Futures rose 0.5% to $1770.

673,Nio Stock Has Too Much Downside to Risk Buying It Now,"Investor enthusiasm for Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock has started to renew since May. After falling to as low as $11.70 per share, the China-based electric vehicle (or EV maker) has climbed back to around $19 per share.

While still down big from its all-time high hit in 2021, it remains one of the more popular EV plays out there among investors.

This mainly is the result of its exposure to the fast-growing Chinese EV market, but also because of the potential for it to move beyond its home market and become a global EV maker on par with companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Before you buy into the bull case that it’ll make a full recovery in the long term, there are many factors that suggest this will not be the case. The best move may be to skip on it and go with more promising names in the space.

NIO Nio $18.87

NIO Stock and the Questionable Bull Case

Nio trades for a fraction of its past highwater mark, but plenty of investors are confident that it’ll make a big recovery. Those bullish on the stock are confident that a sales re-acceleration is just around the corner.

After reporting underwhelming delivery numbers, mainly as a result of China’s virus-related lockdowns, deliveries are expected to pick up later this year. In addition, the company’s expansion of its production capacity is also expected to come online during this time.

This in theory should provide a boost for its results in its home market, and in turn, lead to a boost for NIO stock.

The company’s global expansion is seen as another catalyst for shares. Already selling its EVs in Norway, as InvestorPlace’s Samuel O’Brient reported on Aug. 20, the company is gearing up for its launch in Germany. If its move into Europe proves successful, a launch in North America could follow.

However, while many may be confident that both these possible catalysts will play out, I see it differently. Not only that, but a short-seller’s raising of red flags also casts doubt on the bull case for this stock.

Story continues

Possible Red Flags

When it comes to the possibility of a growth re-acceleration for Nio in China, I’m doubtful. Even as the Chinese government rolls out incentives to spur EV purchases, the slowdown currently playing out in the world’s second-largest economy could outweigh this.

Nio may be ramping up production at just the wrong time. This could mean more disappointing delivery numbers, which will be bad news for NIO stock.

As for its European catalyst, I am also doubtful that this company is a Tesla in the making. Unlike Tesla, which had a first mover advantage when it expanded outside the U.S., this EV maker is going global just as the rest of the auto industry moves big into electrified vehicles.

High competition could limit its ability to capture much of the EV market in Europe. A lack of success there may affect its plans to move into the U.S. EV market.

On top of all this, there may be other risks to the company. A recent “short report” from Grizzly Researchmakes numerous allegations. If just some of the allegations prove true, it could have a serious effect on its stock price.

The Verdict

Nio stock earns a D rating in my Portfolio Grader. While one of the more popular EV stocks, it’s definitely not one of the best ones out there. Its performance in the near-term hinges heavily on a re-acceleration in Chinese delivery growth. Given current economic conditions, this may fail to happen.

Instead, delivery numbers could continue to underwhelm. Competition could stymie its attempt to expand outside its home market. Instead of becoming the “next Tesla,” it may have to ultimately scrap its global expansion plans.

Many short reports prove to be little more than a case of making a mountain out of a molehill, yet it’s possible Grizzly Research is right on the money with its bearish view on shares. Even if Grizzly is only partially right, that may be enough to drag it back to its 52-week low.

With numerous negatives outweighing the positives, steer clear of NIO stock.

675,7 Stocks to Sell When Consumer Confidence Is Falling,"An economic recession is looking increasingly likely and it’s time to look around for stocks to sell.

A majority of economists (72%) polled by the National Association of Business Economics say they expect the U.S. to enter a recession by the middle of next year.

By some measures, the U.S. is already in a recession, popularly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. This is bad news for consumers and businesses.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Consumers, who are already feeling the impact of inflation that is running at 8.5% and higher interest rates used to dampen it are likely to batten down the hatches should the economy turn negative and companies begin mass layoffs.

There are already signs that consumers are beginning to roll over. According to the U.S. Commerce Department, consumer spending rose a tepid 0.1% in June after falling 0.3% in May.

Should things worsen on the consumer front, it could spell bad news for the economy overall, and also for certain stocks that are reliant on robust consumer spending to keep their share prices elevated. Here are seven stocks to sell when consumer confidence is falling.

TSLA Tesla  $891.29 SPG Simon Property Group $106.68 DRI Darden Restaurants $127.68 GPS The Gap $9.91 LUV Southwest Airlines $37.80 MA Mastercard $339.71 MGM MGM Resorts International $34.67

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is so closely associated with its chief executive, Elon Musk, and technology that it’s easy to forget the company makes and sells electric vehicles.

Consumers tend to place big ticket items on the backburner when they are feeling uncertain about the economy or their personal finances. Tesla’s vehicles are among the most expensive. The company’s lowest-priced Model 3 retails for an average of $44,900. The range-topping “Performance” Model 3 sells for nearly $60,000. Those are the types of prices that scare off nervous consumers.

Story continues

For a lot less money, environmentally-conscious consumers can get themselves into a brand new Toyota (NYSE:TM) Prius ($28,000) or a Ford (NYSE:F) Escape hybrid SUV ($32,000).

The prospect of slowing sales helps to explain why Tesla has been increasing its prices this year, most recently announcing that it will raise the price of its full self-driving assistance software by 25% this September.

In June, the company hiked the prices of its electric vehicles across the entire line-up, raising prices an average of $6,000 per vehicle model. The cost of its long-range Model X SUV now approaches $140,000. These are not the types of expenses consumers shell out for during hard times.

Year to date, TSLA stock is down 26% at $885 a share. The stock is scheduled to split on a 3-for-1 basis on Aug. 25, which may give it a pop and you a chance to get out at a profit.

Simon Property Group (SPG) building facade of simon property group (SPG)

While not a household name, Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is the largest operator of shopping malls in the U.S.

The real estate investment trust owns 232 shopping malls and outlet centers that, together, comprise approximately 241,000,000 square feet of retail nirvana.

Simon Property Group has weathered many economic cycles over the years, but its business tends to decline whenever America enters a recession. When the economy is bad, consumers spend less time shopping at the mall and spend less money on frivolous things, concentrating their hard-earned dollars on consumer essentials.

Simon Property also took some big blows during the Covid-19 crisis when its malls and outlets were either forced to close entirely or operate under capacity restrictions. The company’s earnings declined nearly 30% during the pandemic and it was forced to help bailout bankrupt retailers such as J. Crew, Forever 21, and J.C. Penny to help keep its malls occupied during the downturn.

The prospects of an economic recession do not bode well for Simon Property Group, which makes it one of the stocks to sell before they tank. Its recovery from Covid-19 has been slow.

Darden Restaurants (DRI) an Olive Garden sign on the front of the restaurant

Investors might want to avoid Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) stock. Darden Restaurants operates popular restaurant chains such as The Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse and is among the more risky stocks to sell now.

The company currently has 1,800 restaurant locations and 175,000 employees, making it the world’s biggest full-service restaurant operator.

Darden Restaurants suffered during the pandemic and is only now starting to recover.

DRI stock is currently trading, 6% higher than before Covid-19, but a recession could certainly upend its business. Indeed, many restaurant stocks sold off heavily ahead of their most recent earnings.

This was in anticipation of the impact high inflation would have on their results, including Darden.

Confidence in the company’s stock was also shaken recently by reports that Darden’s chief executive officer (CEO), Ricardo Cardenas, sold 1,945 shares of DRI stock worth $236,025. Other shareholders may want to follow Cardenas’ lead.

The Gap (GPS) GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a building

Source: Shutterstock

Clothing retailers such as The Gap (NYSE:GPS) tend to perform badly when the economy turns south and are prime candidates for stocks to sell.

The same can be said of other stocks such as Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), and Foot Locker (NYSE:FL).

Inflation already is taking a toll on GPS stock. Year-to-date, the share price is down 46%.

The company announced last month that CEO Sonia Syngal was stepping down “effective immediately.” This could have contributed in part to the underperformance of GPS stock.

Syngal had only been the head of Gap since March 2020 when the pandemic started. Her departure might have been hastened by the fact that the retailer posted a net loss of $162 million in the three-months ended April 30. That’s compared with a profit of $166 million a year earlier.

Revenue in the quarter declined 13% to $3.48 billion from a year ago. The Gap has said that global supply chain issues and slumping sales have hurt it financially. Expect things to get worse if the economy really tanks.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) luv stock

Source: Ryan Fletcher / Shutterstock.com

Concerns about inflation, rising interest rates, and the outlook for the economy are the main reasons why Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is among the best airline stocks to sell now.

When people are having trouble affording their mortgage or putting gas in their cars, they are less likely to fly to the Caribbean or Florida for a vacation.

LUV stock is down 14% so far in 2022 and 35% lower than where it was prior to March 2020.

Southwest recently reported second-quarter earnings per share of $1.30 on record revenues of $6.7 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts across the board.

However, LUV stock fell immediately following the earnings print on weaker-than-expected forward guidance. Plus, the company said its full-year 2022 available seat miles are likely to be down 4% from a year ago.

While travel across the U.S. remains strong this summer, things could turn negative quickly if consumer confidence is shaken.

Slowing consumer spending means less revenue for Mastercard (NYSE:MA).

Many consumers rely on their credit cards when traveling, booking flights and hotels and dining in restaurants. Any slowdown in those activities could spell disaster for Mastercard.

The stock already is down 8% this year.

Coming out of the pandemic, Mastercard has been seeing steady improvements. The company reported second quarter revenues rose 21% to $5.5 billion. This was ahead of analysts’ estimates of $5.26 billion.

Mastercard said its earnings per share for the three months ended June 30 amounted to $2.56. This was up 31.3% from a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.36 per share.

While the earnings have been impressive, Mastercard’s fortunes could quickly become gloomy if consumers wait out a recession.

MGM Resorts International (MGM) A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.

In good times, when consumers are feeling flush, MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) performs well. But when consumer confidence plunges, so too do revenues and MGM stock.

MGM Resorts’ share price is down 24% this year, trading where it was pre-pandemic.

Increasingly, MGM Resorts is pushing into sports wagering through its “BetMGM” brand. But here too, revenues are dependent on consumers feeling confident.

People are less likely to take risks when they are feeling financially constrained and have less money to play with.

The company reported net revenues of $960 million in this year’s second quarter. That’s an increase of 12% over last year due largely to an increase in business volumes. But will people continue visiting Las Vegas and Atlantic City should the economy turn sour? I wouldn’t bet on it.

676,Tesla shares slip as 3-1 stock split kicks in,"By Akash Sriram and Medha Singh

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's shares closed 2% lower on Thursday as a three-for-one stock split announced by the world's most valuable automaker to woo retail investors came into effect.

The stock opened at $302 and closed at $296.07 as the split allowed investors to get two additional shares for each they owned as of Aug. 17. It had closed at $891.29 before the split on Wednesday.

This is the second stock split by Tesla in as many years and follows similar moves by high-growth companies such as Amazon.com and Google-parent Alphabet to address the growing need to diversify investor base.

Stock splits ""certainly have a higher appeal to retail investors and makes their options more affordable as well,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley.

""Retail investors are a very important cohort for Tesla and today's stock split is an acknowledgment of that fact.""

Austin-based Tesla debuted in 2010 at $17 and in a decade surged to a peak price of $2,000, becoming one of the highest priced shares on Wall Street and making it difficult for small investors to bet on the high-growth stock.

The company decided to split its stock on a five-for-one basis in August 2020 and breached $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2021.

The EV maker is the sixth company in the S&P 500 index to split its shares this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P and Dow Jones indices.

Tesla's ticker was trending on social media stocktwits.com, indicating increased chatter among individual investors. The shares have lost about 11% of their value since March when the company announced plans to increase its number of shares.

""In typical buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news style, investors tend to drastically scale back purchases of splitting stocks in the weeks ensuing the effective split date, causing price momentum to slow,"" analysts at Vanda Research said in a note.

A stock split does not affect the fundamentals of a company, but makes it easier for individual investors to do small trades. The benefits of such splits, however, are becoming less clear as brokerages let customers buy parts of a company's share.

Tesla's shares have fallen about 16% so far this year amid a selloff in high-growth stocks due to worries over aggressive interest rate hikes and geopolitical uncertainties.

Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set to open higher on Thursday, supported by megacap growth stocks and banks, while focus turned to the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole symposium for clues on the central bank's monetary policy outlook.

Wall Street snapped its three-day losing streak on Wednesday boosted by strong gains in energy stocks but closed the session off intraday highs as markets remained cautious on how the Fed plans to curb inflation amid rising concerns around slowing global growth.

""People are coming back to the market gradually with the assumption that a lot of the bad news has already been priced in,"" said Brian Vendig, president of MJP Wealth Advisors.

Chair Jerome Powell's speech due on Friday will be scrutinized for any indication that an economic slowdown might alter the Fed's strategy and if the central bank can achieve a ""soft landing"" for the economy.

""Investors are going to be really keen to hear whether or not the Fed is going to be blind to increasing interest rates and fighting inflation at the cost of economic growth,"" Vendig added.

Traders are seeing a slightly greater likelihood of a third 75 basis-point hike from the Fed at its policy meeting next month, compared to a smaller 50 basis-point rate hike.

Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said it was too soon to predict how much the U.S. central bank would raise interest rates next month, with key reports on inflation and the labor market still to come.

While, Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic said he has not decided if the central bank should increase interest rates by 50 bps or 75 bps in September, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Meanwhile, oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp rose 0.4% each, as crude prices extended their rally on mounting supply tightness concerns.

Big banks also advanced in premarket trading, with Citigroup and Goldman Sachs up 0.6% each.

689,HOG vs. TSLA: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now?,"Investors with an interest in Automotive - Domestic stocks have likely encountered both Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Tesla (TSLA). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.

Currently, both Harley-Davidson and Tesla are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.

Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.

Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.

HOG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.12, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 75.27. We also note that HOG has a PEG ratio of 0.87. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 2.41.

Another notable valuation metric for HOG is its P/B ratio of 2.27. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 25.

Story continues

These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HOG's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of D.

Both HOG and TSLA are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that HOG is the superior value option right now.

691,Tesla says California should toughen EV requirements,"By David Shepardson

Aug 25 (Reuters) - The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is set to vote on Thursday to approve regulations that would require all new vehicles sold in the state by 2035 to be either electric or plug-in electric hybrids that could also have gasoline engines.

Electric carmaker Tesla is calling for a faster route to all electric, but a trade association representing other auto makers said the regulations as proposed would present a tough manufacturing challenge.

California Governor Gavin Newsom first announced the plan to phase out vehicles that run on gasoline by 2035 in September 2020. Once the board votes to approve the new rules, which will set yearly rising zero emission vehicle rules starting in 2026, the Biden administration must approve it before it can take effect.

California is ahead of federal vehicles emissions rules, which currently only extend to 2026 and do not set yearly requirements for zero emission models. More than a dozen other states have adopted California's zero emission requirements.

CARB's new regulation would allow automakers to sell up to 20% plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) by 2035.

Tesla, which produces only all electric vehicles, said in a July 26 filing https://www.arb.ca.gov/lists/com-attach/550-accii2022-UydcPwNxBTpSNVcI.pdf to CARB that the board should require 100% zero emission vehicles by 2030 and increase the stringency of the standard by ""reducing the use of polluting PHEVs in annual compliance.""

CARB's proposal sets new tough requirements for plug-in hybrids, which currently must have at least 10 miles all electric range and will eventually need a minimum 50-mile all electric label range to qualify.

CARB projects that 183,000 https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fww2.arb.ca.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fbarcu%2Fregact%2F2022%2Faccii%2Facciifinalea.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK out of about 2 million vehicles sold in California in 2035 will be plug-in hybrid.

Story continues

Tesla wants other changes to CARB's vehicle charging requirements including dropping requirements that new vehicles have charging adapters and cords that many customers may not use.

Tesla also questioned CARB's battery durability requirements, saying they ""will cause greater tailpipe emissions by harming the rate of electric vehicle uptake through imposition of substantial new costs and designs with reserved battery capacity.""

The Alliance of Automotive Innovation, a trade association representing General Motors, Volkswagen, Toyota and other automakers, said the new CARB rule ""requires tripling EV sales in just three model years."" The auto group said for most states adopting California's rules ""EV sales must increase five- to seven-fold in that same period"" and added the rules will be ""extremely challenging even in California and particularly in the early years.""

By Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Devik Jain

Aug 25 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose on Thursday on support from growth and semiconductor stocks, while investors eyed the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference for clues on its policy outlook.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to give a speech on Friday that will be scrutinized for any indication that an economic slowdown might alter the central bank's strategy.

""The Fed is going to remain pretty resolute and vigilant in their campaign to combat and break the back of inflation,"" said Todd Lowenstein, chief equity strategist of the Private Bank at Union Bank.

""The market has sort of wishful thinking around Fed coming to rescue for any market difficulty right now.""

Data earlier in the day showed the U.S. economy contracted at a more moderate pace than initially thought in the second quarter, dispelling some fears that a recession was underway.

Traders are now seeing a slightly greater likelihood of a third 75-basis-point interest hike from the Fed at its policy meeting next month, compared with a 50-basis-point increase.

Fed officials were on Thursday noncommittal about the size of the interest rate increase at the Sept. 20-21 meeting, but reiterated the view that rates will rise and stay high until inflation has been squeezed.

Investors will also be looking for details on the Fed's plans to reduce its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.

Most high-growth and technology stocks advanced in mid-day trading, with Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc adding more than 1% each, as Treasury yields dipped after four straight sessions of gains.

Graphics chip designer Nvidia Corp rose 3.0% even as it forecast a sharp drop in revenue for the current quarter on the back of a weaker gaming industry.

694,Tesla wants videos of its cars running over child dummies taken down by safety group,"By Hyunjoo Jin

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has demanded a safety advocacy group take down videos of its vehicles running over child dummies when its driver assistant system was engaged, calling them ""defamatory"" and ""misleading.""

The group, the Dawn Project, has launched a nationwide TV campaign warning of alleged potential dangers of what Tesla calls ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) software, adding to public and regulatory scrutiny of the technology.

One of the videos posted by the group shows a Tesla vehicle with FSD software running over child-sized mannequins, and says ""Tell Congress to Shut it Down.""

In a Cease and Desist letter dated Aug. 11, Tesla said the Dawn Project and its founder ""have been disparaging Tesla's commercial interests and disseminating defamatory information to the public."" The letter was disclosed by the Dawn Project on Thursday.

Tesla threatened to take legal action, saying the tests in the videos are ""likely fraudulent"" and ""misrepresent the capabilities of Tesla’s technology.""

The U.S. safety regulator has stepped up investigations of Tesla's Autopilot system following a series of crashes.

The company said its ""FSD Beta,"" a test version of its new automated driving technology used by a limited number of consumers, ""does recognize pedestrians, including children, and when utilized properly, the system reacts to prevent or mitigate a collision.""

The Dawn Project was founded by Dan O'Dowd, a critic of Tesla's FSD system and a software entrepreneur in California who had run for the U.S. Senate.

The Dawn Project said its tests are ""are completely legitimate and not deceptive,"" and called Tesla's letter ""marketing propaganda.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

By Noel Randewich and Bansari Mayur Kamdar

Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq rallied on Thursday, lifted by gains in Nvidia and other technology-related stocks as investors focused on the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference for clues about the central bank's policy outlook.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to give a speech on Friday that investors will dissect for indications of how aggressively the Fed may move to raise interest rates as it battles decades-high inflation.

""We're in a period of time between the end of the second-quarter earnings season and meaningful additional data from the Federal Reserve. Markets are churning a bit with a reasonably low level of volatility,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

The yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury note faded after recently hitting a two-month high. Declining interest rates tend to benefit technology stocks trading at high valuations.

""Lower interest rates have certainly put some support underneath some of the more growth-oriented sectors,"" Northey said.

Nvidia rose 2.8% after the chipmaker gave a weaker-than-expected quarterly forecast that many investors viewed as signaling the worst of a sales downturn may be over. That drove a 2.9% rally in the Philadelphia semiconductor index .

Apple, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet rose more than 1% each, and they all made substantial contributions to the Nasdaq's increase.

Data earlier in the day showed the U.S. economy contracted less than initially thought in the second quarter, dispelling some fears that a recession was underway.

Traders see a slightly greater likelihood of a third 75-basis-point interest hike from the Fed at its policy meeting next month, compared with a 50-basis-point increase.

Fed officials on Thursday were noncommittal about the size of the interest rate increase they plan to approve at their Sept. 20-21 meeting, but they continued hammering the point that rates will rise and stay high until such high rates of inflation has been squeezed from the economy.

Electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc slid almost 1% after its 3-for-1 stock split came into effect.

In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was up 0.79% at 4,173.32 points.

The Nasdaq gained 1.12% to 12,570.65 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.37% at 33,091.39 points.

Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, nine rose, led by communication services, up 1.49%, followed by a 1.42% gain in materials.

Citigroup Inc rose 2% after saying it plans to close its consumer and commercial banking businesses in Russia starting this quarter.

Salesforce Inc fell 4.6% after it cut its annual forecasts over ""measured"" spending from clients and a hit from a stronger dollar.

Additional chipmakers rising on Thursday included Advanced Micro Devices, up 4.3%, and Broadcom, gaining 2.8%.

Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 4.2-to-one ratio.

696,"Tesla stock split isn't the only big catalyst for EV king, analyst says","Tesla's three-for-one stock split that kicked in after the close of trading on Wednesday is just one of many catalysts driving the stock, crow Wall Street analysts.

""After brutal shutdowns in April/May due to the zero Covid policy, we are now seeing unprecedented Model Y production in China after factory upgrades with Musk & Co. on a pace to produce over 1 million vehicles annually out of this key product artery,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients on Thursday.

""Demand is not the problem for Tesla, but supply has been and is now clearly on an upward trajectory with China on its next level of Model Y production while Berlin and Austin ramp its production lines into year-end,"" Ives added. ""While the shaky macro will clearly trim some demand for Tesla (as well as the industry), we believe demand continues to hold up firm for the EV stalwart across the US, Europe, and China.""

The longtime Tesla bull reiterated an outperform rating on Tesla shares and lifted his price target to $360 from $333 as adjusted for the stock split.

Tesla stock fell slightly to $293 as of 2:27 p.m. ET on Thursday and was among the hottest tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform.

Another thing the Street is assessing is how a bullish maneuver from lawmakers will affect Tesla.

The Inflation Reduction Act's new $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles could be a major tailwind to Tesla stock and the company's bottom line, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson pointed out in a note of his own.

""The signing of the Inflation Reduction Act was the equivalent of 'Christmas in August' for Elon Musk & Co., as we peg Tesla as the biggest winner from the new law, as most versions of the industry's two bestselling EVs (Tesla's Model Y and Model 3) become eligible for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit effective January 1, 2023,"" Nelson wrote. ""Previously, all Tesla vehicles had phased out of tax credit eligibility after hitting the 200K units per manufacturer cap.""

Nelson — who also reiterated an outperform rating on the stock with a split-adjusted price target of $415 — also thinks the aforementioned stock split will serve as a bullish catalyst for Tesla.

""In our view, the stock split doesn't change anything fundamentally — the impact is more psychological, as companies with improving prospects and rising stock prices tend to execute stock splits,"" Nelson explained. ""It's worth mentioning that studies have shown that stocks that split tend to outperform the broader market in the 1-3 years following the split. A lower share price could also appeal to retail investors.""

698,California is poised to ban the sale of all new gas-powered cars by 2035 — here are 3 EV stocks that could pop if other states follow suit,"California is poised to ban the sale of all new gas-powered cars by 2035 — here are 3 EV stocks that could pop if other states follow suit

Whether you like electric vehicles or not, it’s hard to deny that we are seeing more and more of them on the road. Even manufacturers known for producing V8s in the old days are now electrifying their fleet.

The reason is not just consumer preference. Regulations also play a critical role.

California, for instance, is expected to approve a plan to end sales of gasoline-powered vehicles over the next 13 years. The plan will set interim targets to phase out new gasoline cars and completely ban the sale of them by 2035.

Daniel Sperling, a board member of the California Air Resources Board, tells CNN that the measure is “monumental.”

Meanwhile, California governor Gavin Newsom called the plan “one of the most significant steps to the elimination of the tailpipe as we know it.”

Other states typically follow California’s lead when it comes to implementing auto emission regulations.

For traditional automakers, it isn’t good news. For EV stocks, on the other hand, it could serve as a powerful catalyst.

ChargePoint Holdings (CHPT)

ChargePoint Holdings is solidly positioned for the EV boom.

The company has one of the largest EV charging networks in the world. It has around 5,000 commercial and fleet customers, including 78% of Fortune 50 companies. Since its inception, ChargePoint has delivered more than 123 million charging sessions.

Of course, EV stocks haven’t been market darlings this year and this EV infrastructure play was caught in the sell-off as well. ChargePoint shares have fallen 31% over the last 12 months.

That could give bargain hunters something to think about.

Story continues

In the fiscal quarter ended Apr. 30, ChargePoint generated $81.6 million of revenue, marking a 102% increase year over year. This was driven by a 122% increase in networked charging revenue and a 63% increase in subscription revenue.

JPMorgan analyst Bill Peterson recently reiterated an ‘overweight’ rating on ChargePoint and raised the price target to $20 — roughly 30% above where the stock sits today.

Blink Charging (BLNK)

With a market cap of around $1.1 billion, Blink Charging is a relatively underfollowed name in the world of EV stocks.

But it has delivered very generous returns to earlier investors.

At the beginning of 2020, Blink Charging was trading at less than $2 per share. Today, it’s at $22.69. You do the math.

As the company’s name suggests, it focuses on the charging side of the business.

Blink has deployed more than 51,000 EV charging ports and has over 423,000 registered users. It uses a proprietary-based software that operates, maintains, and tracks the EV stations connected to its network.

In the first half of 2022, revenue rose 223% from a year ago to $21.3 million.

The increasing adoption of EVs should continue to fuel massive growth in Blink’s business.

Needham & Company analyst Vikram Bagri has a ‘buy’ rating on Blink and a price target of $27 – implying a potential upside of 19%.

Tesla (TSLA)

A list of EV stocks for the future would not be complete without Tesla.

The EV maker has been in the headlines lately due to its completion of a three-for-one stock split. By splitting a share into smaller pieces, each piece will have a lower, more accessible price. Those bite-size shares often draw more interest from retail investors. However, note that a split doesn’t change a company’s underlying fundamentals.

And the fundamentals still appeal to growth investors.

In Q2, the company delivered 254,695 vehicles, representing a 27% increase year-over-year. Production totaled 258,580 vehicles, up 25% from a year ago.

Tesla’s automotive revenue surged 43% year-over-year to $14.6 billion for the quarter. Total revenue grew 42% to $16.9 billion.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives recently raised his price target on Tesla while maintaining an ‘outperform’ rating.

“We are adjusting our pre-split $1,000 price target ($333 post split) to $360 reflecting the 3:1 split as well as improved production from Tesla out of its key China Giga factory during the September quarter with clear momentum heading into year-end,” he wrote in a tweet.

Considering that Tesla trades at $295 per share at the moment, Ives’ new price target suggests a potential upside of 22%.

700,Tesla shares slide after 3-for-1 stock split,"Tesla stock is moving to the downside after its second stock split in two years.

Video Transcript

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Tesla now trading after a 3 to 1 stock split on an adjusted basis after yesterday's close. Now, it did open at $302 and did lose some ground. But as you can see, it's just slightly off about 1 and 1/3 of a percent there. Now, this is just the second split in as many years for this EV-maker.

But we must remember, this doesn't change anything in terms of Tesla's valuation or the fundamentals of the company. But it does make it more attractive, especially if you're a retail investor who was previously priced out.

Now, the stock split naturally led to a flurry of different price target adjustments. We saw Wedbush Securities Dan Ives raising his to $360 from his original post split, $333, on an improved outlook of Tesla's key China gigafactory. Now, Tesla is still trading at 70 times its 2022 earnings forecast, but it is down about 20% year-to-date-- now, obviously, weighed down along with some of these other high growth tech stocks when you have a rate rising environment, Seana.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Rachelle, I don't think it's a lot of surprise here that maybe this could excite some investors, at least in the short-term. You mentioned the fact that it opens up potentially to more retail trade or investor interest here. But I think long-term the story is still the same when it comes to Tesla.

It certainly hasn't seemed like it has been a demand problem. It's always been a production problem. That's something that Dan Ives of Wedbush, like you noted, really talked about in his note. And he's saying that signs are certainly improving-- the Model Y production really picking up in China substantially as we, I guess, move away from the COVID lockdowns. But that's going to be the real issue for Tesla-- meeting that demand and really seeing how substantially they are able to exceed some of their expectations.

DAVE BRIGGS: I'll just be curious generally speaking, if the stock splits continue. It is the sixth S&P company to do that this year after Alphabet and Amazon. And now it's a lot easier for traders to get a fractional piece of these stocks-- a much easier play now, so I'll be curious if that trend begins to slow now that all of us can do it.",2022-08-25T19:42:12+00:00,2022-08-25
701,California bans all new gas-powered car sales by 2035,"The state of California has approved a first-of-its-kind rule that will ban the sale of all new gas-powered cars in the future.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) voted to require automakers to only sell new electric and certain hybrids in the state by 2035.

The action is is the strictest ruling banning gas-powered cars in the U.S. and worldwide. The E.U.’s proposal to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars is still being hammered out by member countries.

""The climate crisis is solvable if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to stem the tide of carbon pollution,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday. Newsom proposed the 2035 ban two years ago with an executive order that directed CARB and others to determine how to implement the plan.

The rule requires automakers to hit milestones along the way: By 2026, 35% of new cars in the state must be zero-emission vehicles and that rises to 68% by 2030. Traffic moves along a freeway as vehicles travel towards Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 22, 2022. REUTERS/Mike Blake

California’s adoption of the rule could have a huge ripple effect as many other states adopt California's rules for their own emissions regulations. California is the only state that can ask for an EPA waiver to make its own rules.

There are 17 other states that follow California’s emissions standards, and those states would be next to enact new rules.

Some automakers are on board with this measure.

“We’re committed to building a zero-emissions transportation future that includes everyone, backed by our own investments of more than $50 billion by 2026 in EVs and batteries,” Ford’s (F) chief sustainability officer said in a statement. “The CARB Advanced Clean Cars II rule is a landmark standard that will define clean transportation and set an example for the United States.""

Toyota (TM) has also recognized the state’s ability to enact its own emissions standards. However, an industry group that represents automakers and other suppliers believes the new rule is too aggressive.

“California today is about 18 percent EV market share and leading the nation which stands at 6.3 percent market share,"" John Bozzella, CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said in a statement to Yahoo Finance. ""Despite this positive trend, California’s EV sale mandates are still very aggressive – even in California with decades of supportive EV policies – and will be extremely challenging.”

Story continues

“Whether or not these requirements are realistic or achievable is directly linked to external factors like inflation, charging and fuel infrastructure, supply chains, labor, critical mineral availability and pricing, and the ongoing semiconductor shortage,"" Bozzella added. ""These are complex, intertwined and global issues well beyond the control of either CARB or the auto industry.”

For its part, Tesla (TSLA), which is not part of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, believes the rule doesn’t go far enough.

In a statement to CARB that offered amendments to the proposal, Tesla said the ban should go into effect by 2030 and that rules allowing the use of hybrid or PHEV sales should be more stringent.

But Tesla was critical of CARB’s rules for battery durability requirements, claiming those rules will harm “the rate of electric vehicle uptake through imposition of substantial new costs and designs” and won't have any benefit to reducing emissions.

* Data shows mild U.S. economic contraction in second quarter

* Salesforce falls after slashing outlook

* Tesla slides as 3-for-1 stock split kicks in (Updates with end of trading session)

By Noel Randewich and Bansari Mayur Kamdar

Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq ended sharply higher on Thursday, lifted by gains in Nvidia and other technology-related stocks as investors focused on the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole conference for clues about the central bank's policy outlook.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to give a speech on Friday that investors will dissect for indications of how aggressively the Fed may move to raise interest rates as it battles decades-high inflation.

""We're in a period of time between the end of the second-quarter earnings season and meaningful additional data from the Federal Reserve. Markets are churning a bit with a reasonably low level of volatility,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

The yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury note faded after recently hitting a two-month high. Declining interest rates tend to benefit technology stocks trading at high valuations.

""Lower interest rates have certainly put some support underneath some of the more growth-oriented sectors,"" Northey said.

Nvidia rose after the graphics chipmaker gave a weaker-than-expected quarterly forecast that many investors viewed as signaling the worst of a sales downturn may be over. That drove a rally in the Philadelphia semiconductor index .

Apple, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet also rose, making substantial contributions to the Nasdaq's increase.

Data earlier in the day showed the U.S. economy contracted less than initially thought in the second quarter, dispelling some fears that a recession was underway.

Traders see a slightly greater likelihood of a third 75-basis-point interest hike from the Fed at its policy meeting next month, compared with a 50-basis-point increase.

Story continues

Fed officials on Thursday were noncommittal about the size of the interest rate increase they plan to approve at their Sept. 20-21 meeting, but they continued hammering the point that rates will rise and stay high until such high rates of inflation have been squeezed from the economy.

Electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc slid after a 3-for-1 stock split came into effect.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 59.77 points, or 1.44%, to end at 4,200.54 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 206.15 points, or 1.69%, to 12,641.26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 332.74 points, or 1.01%, to 33,298.67.

Following Thurday's rally, the S&P 500 remains down about 12% in 2022, while the Nasdaq is down about 20%.

Citigroup Inc climbed after saying it plans to close its consumer and commercial banking businesses in Russia starting this quarter.

Salesforce Inc fell after it cut its annual forecasts over ""measured"" spending from clients and a hit from a stronger dollar.

Additional chipmakers rallying on Thursday included Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom.

704,UPDATE 1-California to end sales of gasoline-only cars by 2035,"(Adds comments by California environmental official, auto industry trade group, oil industry trade group, Tesla's senior counsel, background)

By David Shepardson

Aug 25 (Reuters) - California on Thursday moved to require all new vehicles sold in the state by 2035 to be either electric or plug-in electric hybrids, a landmark move that could speed the end of gasoline-powered vehicles.

California Governor Gavin Newsom first announced the plan to phase out vehicles that run only on gasoline by 2035 in September 2020. The California Air Resources Board voted on Thursday to approve the new rules, which set yearly rising zero- emission vehicle rules starting in 2026, but the Biden administration must still approve the new requirements before the plan can take effect.

California has moved faster than the federal government and other states in setting strict standards for vehicle emissions. More than a dozen other states have adopted California's earlier zero-emission requirements.

""This is a historic moment for California, for our partner states and for the world as we set forth a path toward a zero emission future,"" said CARB Chair Liane Randolph.

California officials said the rules by 2037 will cut by 25% smog-causing pollution from light-duty vehicles. The rules mandate that 35% of the new cars sold be plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), EVs or hydrogen fuel cell by 2026. That proportion will rise to 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.

By 2030, there will be 2.9 million fewer new gas-powered vehicles sold, widening to 9.5 million fewer conventional vehicles by 2035, CARB said.

Steve Douglas, a vice president at the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp and other automakers, said on Thursday the CARB rules ""are the most sweeping and transformative regulations in the history of the automobile.""

Electric car maker Tesla Inc called for a faster route to all-electric sales, but the auto group said the regulations will be ""extremely challenging even in California and particularly in the early years.""

Story continues

California is ahead of federal vehicle emissions rules, which currently extend only to 2026 and do not set yearly requirements for zero-emission models.

CARB's new regulation would allow automakers to sell up to 20% PHEVs by 2035. That may boost Toyota, which is investing heavily in plug-ins, and which agreed earlier this week to recognize California's authority to set vehicle rules.

Tesla, which produces only electric vehicles, said in a July 26 filing https://www.arb.ca.gov/lists/com-attach/550-accii2022-UydcPwNxBTpSNVcI.pdf to CARB that the board should require 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and increase the stringency of the standard by ""reducing the use of polluting PHEVs in annual compliance."" It also sought changes on battery and charging cord requirements.

Tesla Senior Counsel Joseph Mendelson said on Thursday the CARB proposal ""is both achievable and paves the way for California to lead in electrifying the light duty sector.""

CARB's proposal sets tough new requirements for plug-in hybrids, which currently must have at least 10 miles (16.1 km)all-electric range and will eventually need a minimum 50-mile all-electric range label to qualify.

CARB projects that 183,000 https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fww2.arb.ca.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fbarcu%2Fregact%2F2022%2Faccii%2Facciifinalea.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK out of about 2 million vehicles sold in California in 2035 will be plug-in hybrid.

The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association on Thursday urged President Joe Biden and the Environmental Protection Agency to ""reject California’s request for a Clean Air Act waiver to proceed with this unlawful ban.""

The group said federal approval ""would hand over sweeping federal government authority to California regulators, effectively appointing Governor Newsom and CARB as car and truck czars for the entire United States.""

The White House and EPA did not immediately comment. Biden has previously declined to back setting a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. The EPA is currently working on the next round of U.S. emissions limits through at least 2030.

Seventeen U.S. states have agreed to adopt California's tailpipe emissions rules and 15 have backed its zero-emission vehicle requirements. A group of 17 other states has challenged the EPA's decision to restore California's authority to set emissions rules that was withdrawn under former president Donald Trump.

715,Elon Musk deploys team of lawyers to scrub damaging Tesla self-driving video from internet,"Elon Musk dispatched his Tesla lawyers to silence a critic of the company’s Full Self-Driving technology for “misrepresenting” a driver assistance system he believes can mint it billions of dollars in profits.

In a cease-and-desist letter seen by the Washington Post, the carmaker argued video footage posted to the internet by the so-called Dawn Project showing Tesla vehicles running over child-size crash test dummies while allegedly using FSD was defamatory and needed to be taken down.

“The purported tests misuse and misrepresent the capabilities of Tesla’s technology, and disregard widely recognized testing performed by independent agencies,” wrote Tesla deputy general counsel Dinna Eskin in a letter quoted by the paper and dated Aug. 11.

The video has already been viewed roughly 1 million times, prompting amateur Tesla fans—many of whom own shares in the company—to try to reenact the test with real children to prove otherwise, only for YouTube content moderators to intervene.

According to the Washington Post, the company’s lawyers leaned on claims by Tesla-friendly website Electrek that FSD was “never engaged,” since it requires map data to be activated and the test was performed on a closed course.

The Dawn Project responded at the time by providing the website a sworn statement that FSD was activated “in the manner instructed by the owner’s manual.”

https://twitter.com/RealDanODowd/status/1556973572698128385?s=20u0026t=8qXcNR3jlptohqwQ7-a-Kg

The cease-and-desist letter gave Dan O’Dowd, an auto industry supplier behind the Dawn Project, the chance to use Musk’s words against him and lampoon the entrepreneur for past claims he would buy Twitter to protect basic human rights.

“Master scammer Musk threatens to sue me over a TV ad. Turns out Mr. Free Speech Absolutist is just another crybaby hiding behind his lawyer’s skirt,” crowed O’Dowd, CEO and owner of Green Hills Software.

Potential profits are ‘crazy’

Speaking to the Post, he dismissed the order from Tesla’s lawyers and claimed he had no intention of taking the video down.

Story continues

In January, O’Dowd came out of nowhere to buy full-page ads warning Americans of the risks of FSD and to claim he would “organize the opposition to Musk’s ill-advised FSD robot car experiment,” sparking accusations he was acting at the behest of rival carmakers.

The Dawn Project claims millions of people would die every day if Tesla’s FSD as is was allowed to operate unsupervised. It wants to ban unsafe software from safety-critical systems that could potentially be a target for hackers, both rogue and state-sponsored.

For Musk, who called Green Hills’ software “a pile of trash,” FSD offers the promise of potentially $50 billion or more in additional annual revenue with the kind of high double-digit margins typical of the software industry.

“You run the numbers and it’s like, ‘Wow, can it really be that crazy?’ But it could be that crazy,” he told shareholders at this month’s annual meeting.

https://twitter.com/heydave7/status/1482820253742678024?s=20u0026t=jTML6F6plqacLzelkCbvRg

Musk first rolled out the heavily touted yet unfinished software in October 2020 when he gave selective access to initially some 1,000 customers.

At the time Musk argued FSD was in “beta,” a term from the software industry when there may be some last remaining bugs in the code that need to be identified before a finished product can then be shipped to customers.

In Tesla’s case, it has come to take on the meaning of an incomplete feature undergoing rolling development cycles for upwards of two years now, during which Musk has made major revisions in the software build.

Last September he then expanded the beta to what he claimed were trustworthy drivers ranking the highest on his company’s proprietary safety score. (Important social media influencers like fund manager and Tesla bull Ross Gerber, however, were notably allowed to jump the line.)

Criticism not wanted

This has allowed Musk, who has effectively redefined the term “beta,” to recruit his most vociferous fans to serve as FSD developers.

Not only do they provide a constant stream of new data he can mine to make improvements, Musk also offloads liability for ensuing accidents onto his paying customers in the process since Tesla lawyers insist on the fine print classifying it as a driver assist feature.

At this month’s shareholder meeting, he said over 100,000 FSD owners in North America have already racked up over 40 million miles and counting—valuable data he can then use to keep feeding his machine-learning neural nets.

The Aug. 11th letter by Tesla counsel Eskin defends the company’s claims over FSD’s safety by citing “experiences shared by our customers.” But a revealing exchange this week shows why these, too, need to be taken with caution.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1562157209513066501?s=20u0026t=fbkPJJcyz1fiSfeNS87vmQ

James Locke, founder of a Tesla Owners club, is one of the few to purchase FSD who received access right off the bat. When he tweeted on Tuesday that the latest version 10.69 still needed a lot of work, the Tesla CEO snapped.

Musk, who never objects to effusive praise about FSD posted to social media, told Locke he shouldn’t have volunteered to test the beta if he had a problem with it.

“Let me make something clear, James contacted me directly to be included in *early* beta, which is only around 1,000 cars, mostly employees,” he wrote. “Early beta explicitly has issues or it would be rolled out widely, so publicly criticizing something he had asked for is wrong.”

After Locke apologized under pressure from other Tesla fans, he tagged Musk two days later in another tweet noting just how “amazing” the software was in an apparent reversal of his original criticism.

The incident suggests potential Tesla FSD customers may want to carefully consider the competing claims on social media, whether from O’Dowd or Musk, before paying for a feature that what will soon cost $15,000.

716,10 American Stocks with High Exposure to China,"In this article, we discuss 10 American stocks with high exposure to China. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 American Stocks with High Exposure to China.

On top of slowing economic growth, China is facing a drought which threatens food production, leading the local authorities and the state to go all out and ensure that the remaining crops survive an extremely hot summer. The government is also urging for water conservation, and calling out farmers to implement water saving methods like staggered irrigation and cloud seeding.

The Chinese mortgage crisis is impacting economic growth in the country as well, as banks are looked upon for loans and extensions to alleviate some pressure on builders. However, banks are unsure whether  these loans will be paid back. Not assisting with loans also means that banks end up losing mortgage payments. The pandemic-driven damage is still impacting the economy as well.

According to a Bloombergreport, dated August 24, China is enhancing its economic stimulus package, injecting another 1 trillion yuan, or $146 billion, which is meant for infrastructure spending. However, this financial support will not be nearly enough for the economy to rebound from multiple Covid lockdowns and a real estate crisis. The fiscal package will support state banks in order to sponsor more infrastructure projects, and local governments will be allotted money as well.

Economists were somewhat unenthusiastic about the Chinese financial measures, and the markets also remained muted. Goldman Sachs predicts that the stimulus is not sufficient to boost economic growth from 3% like the government expects.

Since the United States has always had deep ties with China in terms of trade, despite political tensions, American stocks are vulnerable to China’s economic slowdown. Some American stocks with high exposure to the Asian superpower include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE).

Investors are finally starting to appreciate DuPont’s effort to cut costs, streamline operations, and spin off companies into pure-play companies that trade at higher multiples.

“Within technology and communication services, we own a number of online businesses and semiconductor related companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Intel, Applied Materials and Texas Instruments. Within the realm of high technology, we believe that leadership positions reflect enduring and widening competitive advantages over smaller competitors, with few exceptions. This is because online businesses, as well as semiconductor companies, benefit from economies of scale. An online search and advertising engine will, in general, be more profitable per unit of cost as it grows larger in terms of users and advertising dollars. It is a hub-and-spoke model, in other words, where it is generally not necessary to grow expenses at the same rate that revenues grow beyond a certain threshold. Therefore, returns on capital tend to be higher, the larger and more dominant the online search company is.”

720,The 7 Best Battery Stocks to Buy Now,"Some factors that have served as headwinds for the electric vehicle (EV) industry include economic uncertainty, inflation and supply-chain issues. However, the industry is still at an early growth stage. One segment of the industry that’s positioned for explosive growth are EV batteries. In uncertain market conditions, it’s a good time to consider exposure to some of the best battery stocks.

In terms of growth potential, the electric vehicle battery market is expected to be worth $559.87 billion by 2030. Through this period, the industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32%. Clearly, there is a big addressable market and some attractive investment options.

It’s also worth noting that the EV batteries market will likely experience growth beyond 2030. As an example, the European battery market value is expected to hit 1.7 trillion euros by 2040.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Therefore, there will be intermediate corrections, even in the best battery stocks. However, considering the demand estimates, the long-term trend for these stocks will remain positive.

Let’s talk about the seven best battery stocks to buy for the next decade. This includes some established companies along with emerging players that stand to benefit from positive tailwinds.

Best Battery Stocks: Panasonic Holdings (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z

I believe that Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) is the best battery stock to consider. PCRFY stock has declined by 20% in the last six months. This seems like a good accumulation opportunity from a long-term perspective.

It’s worth noting that Panasonic already has a lithium-ion battery factory in the U.S. This factory is jointly operated with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Panasonic has planned another battery factory in Kansas with an investment of $4 billion. This factory will serve Tesla and other automakers.

Panasonic is also focused on cobalt-free batteries. With China controlling almost 80% of the cobalt refining industry, this move is likely to benefit U.S. electric vehicle makers.

Also, in terms of the innovation edge, Panasonic plans to increase battery density by 20% by 2030. This will boost the driving range and also allow for the creation of lighter electric vehicles.

Overall, with sustained investment in manufacturing expansion and innovation, Panasonic is likely to remain a key force in the battery industry.

BYD Company (BYDDY) BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.

BYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) stock is also among the best battery stocks that’s attractive at current levels. In the last six months, the stock has trended higher by 10%. I expect upside for this Warren Buffett-backed stock to continue.

As an overview, BYD Company is a vertically integrated manufacturer of electric vehicles. In June 2022, a senior executive of BYD indicated that the company will soon be supplying batteries to Tesla.

The company believes that its blade battery will redefine EV safety standards. This is likely to increase the company’s market share with several vehicle brands in discussion for “partnerships based on the technology of the blade battery.”

It’s also worth mentioning here that BYD is the leading seller of electric vehicles in China. With favorable policies, the company stands to benefit from sustained growth in vehicle deliveries.

Goldman Sachs also believes that the company’s profitability is likely to grow further in the second half of 2022. A key reason is shifting production mix to higher price models. This is another catalyst for upside in BYDDY stock.

Best Battery Stocks: Lithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen

Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is an indirect way to benefit from the sustained growth in demand for batteries. As an overview, Lithium Americas is a lithium miner with assets in the U.S. and Argentina.

Estimates from McKinsey indicate that batteries will account for 95% of lithium demand by 2030. Further, lithium demand is expected to increase at a CAGR of 30% through 2030. Clearly, lithium stocks stand to benefit.

The company’s Thacker Pass project has a mine life of 46 years with a potential to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $520 million. Further, the Cauchari-Olaroz project has an average annual EBITDA potential of $308 million.

Once these projects go on-stream, Lithium Americas is positioned to deliver robust cash flows. With a strong balance sheet, financing the projects is unlikely to be a challenge. LAC stock has been sideways for the last six months. This seems like a good accumulation opportunity.

Currently, 98% of lithium production is from Australia, Latin America and China. With rising demand, several countries are looking to accelerate mining of lithium assets. Also, considering the tight demand-supply scenario for the coming years, investors can consider more than one lithium stock for their portfolios.

Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)  is among the top producers of lithium. ALB stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.2 and looks attractive for long-term exposure.

A key reason to like Albemarle is the expected growth in the lithium segment in the next few years. Through 2026, the company expects lithium net sales to increase at a CAGR of 26%.

Further, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin from the segment is expected to increase from 33% in 2021 to 45% in 2026. Clearly, the segment will be the primary cash-flow generator for the company.

ALB stock also offers investors an annualized dividend of $1.58. Given the growth visibility, it’s likely that dividends will also increase on a sustained basis.

Best Battery Stocks: QuantumScape (QS) A hand holds a phone and the screen shows the QuantumScape logo

Among emerging players in the battery space, QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) looks interesting. QS stock has declined sharply by 48% in the last 12 months. However, the worst of the correction seems to be over, and the stock is in a consolidation mode.

As an overview, QuantumScape is in the development stage of solid-state batteries. These batteries are being touted as drivers of the next generation of electric vehicles. As an example, these potentially higher-density batteries can be charged very quickly.

Of course, production of these batteries is still few years away. QuantumScape is targeting 2025 for potential commencement of production. However, considering the deep correction in the stock, it might be a good time to accumulate.

From a financial perspective, QuantumScape expects to have a liquidity buffer of $950 million by the end of 2022. With ample liquidity buffer, the company seems to be financed through 2023. If positive developments related to the solid-state battery sustain, QS stock is likely to trend higher from current levels.

Microvast Holdings (MVST) EV stocks: an electric vehicle charging

Another emerging player that’s worth adding to the list of best battery stocks is Microvast Holdings (NASDAQ:MVST). In the last six months, MVST stock has declined by 63%. However, the stock is already higher from 52-week lows. The reversal rally is likely to sustain.

Microvast believes that by 2030, the demand for EV batteries is likely to increase 14-fold as compared to 2018. The company intends to capitalize on this demand growth through innovation in battery technology.

Microvast claims to have a cutting-edge cell technology. The focus is on higher energy density, lower costs, fast charging and higher battery life. The company has more than 630 patents and pending patent applications. With an innovative edge, the outlook is positive. Furthermore, with a forecasted revenue backlog of $2.5 billion through 2030, it seems that the company is positioned for stellar growth.

For 2022, Microvast expects mid-range revenue growth of 40% on a year-over-year basis. With optimism on order inflows, it’s likely that top-line growth will accelerate in the coming years.

Best Battery Stocks: Solid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.

Considering the backing by some big names, I would also include Solid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) in my list of best battery stocks. The Colorado-based startup is being backed by Ford (NYSE:F) and BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY).

In June 2022, it was reported that Solid Power had commenced pilot manufacturing of solid-state batteries. If the progress is smooth, mass production of batteries will begin in 2024.

It’s worth noting that Solid Power will be supplying batteries to Ford and BMW. The revenue visibility is therefore secure once mass production begins.

Additionally, with the backing of two automotive giants, Solid Power is unlikely to face any financial hurdles. Significant scaling-up of operations is in the cards if pilot testing is successful.

SLDP stock has largely traded flat in the last six months. I expect the stock to surge higher once the results from the pilot tests are public.

721,Tesla argues California's EV mandate should be stricter,"California will start banning gas-powered cars in 2035, but Tesla is calling for the rules to be stricter and enforced by 2030 instead.

Video Transcript

- Gas powered cars in California about to run out of gas over the next 13 years. Golden State regulators voted Thursday to ban the sale of new gas powered cars by 2035. If it were its own country, California would be the world's fifth biggest economy, giving it tremendous influence over the entire auto industry.

So speculation is several states will follow in their lead, but the rule would not apply to used cars. Needless to say, this shakes up the entire auto industry, the oil industry, as well as several others. Rochelle, I want to get your thoughts.

- I mean, we do know that things were heading in this direction anyway. When you look at some of these big oil and gas companies, they're still pushing a lot of their research and their research and development into clean energy. So they know this is a transition. This is probably a faster transition than they wanted.

I thought it was interesting that we saw Tesla responding to this California EV law, saying that they believe the proposal should be amended to achieve an overall stringency level of 100% of ZEVs by 2030, and they actually even went even further when it came to talking about hybrids. They also included that, saying that they really wanted to see the use of some of these plug-in EVs, PHEVs, or electric vehicles in annual compliance as well. So they're really--

- Sure.

- You know, Tesla, obviously, has its own vested interest in this.

- Of course, you could have named this after them. They are the one who benefits here. The rest of the economy, the rest of the companies, not so much. Look, I think this is a nice idea, except for two main things, supply and demand, which are kind of important.

So let's first talk about demand. Demand nationally for EVs right now is about 6% of all automobiles. People don't largely want them, despite the high price of gas. In California, it's almost triple that, but it's still at near 15%. Why? A couple of reasons. Chargers are very expensive. EVs are very expensive.

Story continues

The average EV is $66,000 today. The average gas powered car is $44,000. This is unattainable for the average American. There's more stats.

The Ford F-150, the largest, fastest, best selling truck over the last 40 years, it averages $47,000 in the EV space, $31,000 for gas powered. This entirely leaves out an enormous portion of the American people. RJ Scaringe, so let's get to the demand, the supply side of this.

RJ says, 90% to 95% of the supply chain for batteries does not exist today. So yes, it's a nice idea, except they're missing supply and demand. Oh, by the way, about 10,000 gas stations in California are about to go out of business. I think this is a deplorable concept to force by 2035.

- I'm not sure. I mean, obviously, this is more than a decade from now, and what we saw with gas prices spiking, something that was beyond people's control, no one could have predicted a war in Ukraine. That's when you start to see people considering this, and yes, it may be that sort of push that they didn't want to have to have. But if you see gas prices, again, after the next event going above $5 a gallon, it might be something that you'd be willing to adopt. And even though we've seen California does tend to take the lead on this, a JD Power study also showed that after the West, the South is the next most receptive region followed by the Northeast and North Central region.

So it's not as if there isn't some receptiveness to this, but like you said, it does require better infrastructure in place before people will do it. But, I mean, we're talking 2035. This is not tomorrow.

- There's about five chargers down South. I could go on for the next five minutes, but clearly, we have made our opinions known.",2022-08-26T20:23:21+00:00,2022-08-26

723,"Stocks: AMC, Zoom, Peloton, Tesla, Affirm big movers this week","Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo breaks down trending tickers this week.

Video Transcript

- All right, we're wrapping up a busy week on Wall Street. Here's the look back at some of the biggest moves this week. On Monday, it was all about the meme trades with AMC, the stock plunging after the company's APE units began trading. They're effectively a two for one stock split of sorts, which are a tool for the company to potentially raise additional cash in the future, and the move to issue those units would dilute the company's main shares even more.

Then, on Tuesday, Zoom shares tanked on earnings. The company's second quarter of revenue missed analysts' expectations, and the guidance was weak. Shifting to Wednesday, Peloton shares riding high on news the fitness company made a deal to sell gear on Amazon, but the rally was short lived. Peloton reported weak earnings on Thursday, and the stock gave back a lot of those gains from Wednesday.

And on Thursday, Tesla was the stock to watch after the company's three for one stock split took effect. Now, this was Tesla's second stock split in two years, and this one was approved by shareholders back in June. And, of course, today, Affirm shares plunging on earnings. The company posted a wider than expected loss in its fiscal fourth quarter.",2022-08-26T21:02:37+00:00,2022-08-26

731,20 Most Expensive Stocks In the US,"Regardless of whether you're a day trader or a long term investor, the 20 most expensive stocks in the US will cause a double-take! No matter what one's situation is, or what the economy's situation is, investing is always a necessity, and is always better than money just sitting in your bank losing value by the day. This is especially true today, where inflation has crossed double digits or near enough in most countries including the United States, where it reached an all time high of 9.1% in June.

On the other hand, investing seems like a risky exercise because of the uncertain economy, as the US stock market recorded its worst first half in more than half a century this year, and many major stocks have plunged, with tech stocks being particularly susceptible to major decreases. People have considered switching to investing in cryptocurrency, especially after the dizzying gains seen last year, but the unstable industry has cost many their life savings as bitcoin declined by more than 70% off its all time high, while other alt-coins suffered even worse fates, exposing to the masses the risks of investing in a completely unregulated industry.

When investing in stocks, it is important to not just jump on the bandwagon, but carry out the necessary research and understand both the technicals and fundamentals of a stock. It is important to check the growth of a company, with CAGR, or compound annual growth rate an excellent indicator, while also checking profitability, profit trends, net assets, debt and liquidity among many other aspects. There are ratios you can use that make it easy to assess companies and compare companies, though it is important to remember that benchmarks may be different for different industries. For example, the growth rate of a tech company will tend to be much higher than a pharmaceutical company, but that doesn't make it a better buy automatically.

However, it is also important to remember that just because a company is registering strong sales, that doesn't mean that its share price will increase in a corresponding manner. Often, these expected increases are built into the share price, which means that if a company registers strong growth but less than what analysts expected, the share price will actually fall. For example, if company A delivers a growth rate of 12% but analyst predictions and market sentiment expected a growth rate of 15%, the share price will fall as the expectation of a 15% growth rate was already baked into the share price.

If you are looking for the most expensive stocks in the US to identify the best stocks to buy, this isn't a very robust investment approach. Investment professionals usually recommend investing in the biggest stocks by market value instead of stocks that have the highest share price. The reasoning is straightforward. The most expensive stocks are usually the stocks that had high stock returns in the past but never decided to split their shares. On the other hand, biggest stocks by market value usually had higher stock returns but decided to split their shares to make them more affordable for the average investor. One example is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Last week Tesla Inc.'s stock had a 3-1 split which meant each Tesla share is now worth around $300 instead of $900. However, this doesn't mean that Tesla's entire market value went down by two thirds. Tesla shareholders now own 3 shares instead of one share before.  Two years ago Tesla also had a 5-1 split. If Tesla didn't have these two stock splits its stock price today would have been $4500 instead of $300 and Tesla would have been one of the companies in our list of the most expensive US stocks.

If you are looking to invest in some of the most expensive stocks in the US, know that most expensive stock has a share price that costs more than a decent home! For our rankings, we have taken the share price of each company from Yahoo Finance.

West Texas Intermediate rose toward $94 a barrel, reversing an earlier decline, after gaining 2.5% last week. In Libya, clashes between militias in the capital left at least 23 dead, sparking fears of further upheaval in the OPEC nation. While Libya’s output so far remains stable, investors are watching for signs that the violence may again put oil shipments at risk just as Europe reels from an energy crisis.

Iran, meanwhile, said exchanges with the US over a European Union proposal to revive a nuclear deal will drag on into next month, undercutting speculation that an agreement paving the way for increased oil flows is imminent.

Crude is on course for a third straight monthly drop on concern global growth will slow as central banks tighten policy aggressively, hurting consumption. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned of the need for higher rates, while a top European Central Bank official said that there was “little choice” but to press on even if the region’s economy dipped into recession.

To counter that weakness, Saudi Arabia raised the possibility last week that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies could cut output, drawing support from fellow members. Separately, loadings from an export terminal for Kazakhstan crude have seen interruptions.

“There are many risks that could potentially lead to supply disruptions,” including the situation in Libya and a longer timeframe for the Iran nuclear talks, said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group AG. Investors and traders are also focused on “what OPEC might do next week and ongoing substitution of oil for natural gas.”

The producers’ group and partners, known collectively as OPEC+, meet Sept. 5 to consider production levels for October and to review the outlook for the rest of the year. Meanwhile in Europe, future power prices hit a record of more than 1,000 euros ($993) a megawatt-hour for the first time as Russia squeezes flows of gas to the continent.

In a bullish note on commodities, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that crude oil had scope to push higher, especially amid shortages of other energy raw materials including natural gas.

“With oil the commodity of last resort in an era of severe energy shortages, we believe the pullback in the entire oil complex provides an attractive entry point for long-only investments,” analysts including Sabine Schels wrote.

737,"Forget Meltdown, Each Dip Offers a Solid Entry Point: 5 Picks","On Aug 26, Wall Street suffered a bloody blow, ending the summer rally that U.S. stock markets saw from mid-June to mid-August. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 3%, 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, following a stern message from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium.

At this stage, investors should patiently wait and reallocate their portfolios for mid-to-long-term gains instead of immediate profits. Each and every dip provides a solid opportunity to enter the market. With respect to the buy-on-dip strategy, we present five U.S. corporate giants with strong fundamentals and a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies are — Tesla Inc. TSLA, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Marriott International Inc. MAR, Humana Inc. HUM and Visa Inc. V.

Buy on Every Dip as US Fundamentals Remain Solid

Powell reiterated that the central bank would pursue aggressive interest rate hikes and tighter momentary control policies until inflation comes down to at least near its 2% target level. Market participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to margin squeeze resulting in negative-to-moderate GDP growth. Fed Chairman has also warned of some toughness going forward.

However, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid and the recent downtrend in GDP growth was purely Fed-induced. The central bank wants the economy to cool down to some extent to bring back inflation to an acceptable level. So, the U.S. economy should be back on the growth trajectory once monetary policies return to normalcy.

U.S. stock markets are the best destinations for investors. The gigantic size of the U.S. economy has given it a clear upper hand over the European and emerging markets. Furthermore, technological innovation and superiority have always been the pillars of U.S. economic strength.

The U.S. economy also has several future catalysts. On Aug 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed a $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act. The size of the allotted money may rise up to $737 billion in 10 years. The act has provisions of $390 billion to combat climate change. Per the Biden administration, the most important way to restore a clean climate is to encourage Americans to shift toward electric vehicles.

Story continues

On Aug 10, 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act that will provide $52.7 billion to microprocessor developers for five years. On Nov 15, 2021,  the President had signed a bipartisan infrastructure act of $550 billion in addition to the previously approved funds of $450 billion for five years. The law aims at establishing the United States with the world's best economic infrastructure. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years.

Investment Strategy

At this stage, several stocks look attractive for future growth. However, selecting stocks on the basis of the following three criteria will make the task easy. First, choose U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital > $50 billion) with a well-established business model, globally acclaimed brand recognition and robust financial condition.

Second, look for stocks that have strong growth potential for 2022 and an impressive long-term (estimated 3-5 years) growth rate, which is well above the market’s benchmark S&P 500 Index’s long-term growth rate of 11.4%.

Third, pick stocks that carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Allocate funds among these stocks and purchase them in parts at every dip to make an effective cost average.

Our Top Picks

Based on the above-mentioned investment strategy, we have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths to buy-on-the-dip to generate handsome profits in the mid-to-long-term.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months. Zacks Investment Research

Tesla is likely to be the largest beneficiary of the U.S. Government’s clean climate initiatives. Increasing Model 3 delivery, which forms a significant chunk of Tesla’s overall deliveries, is aiding its top line. Along with Model 3, Model Y is contributing to its revenues. The global auto industry is gradually moving toward electric vehicles. TSLA is expected to be the largest beneficiary of this trend.

Tesla has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 58.2% and 65%, respectively, for the current year. Moreover, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 31.2%. The electric vehicle marker posted positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 32.2%.

Exxon Mobil’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.

This August on Bloomberg ETF IQ, ARK Investment Management's Cathie Wood commented that the Federal Reserve shouldn't be expected to start cutting interest rates any sooner than 2023. Wood stated that the U.S. economy is currently in a weak place, bringing the market into a deep recession that will have to be dealt with by the Fed in the coming quarters. On the topic of her firm's movements in such a market downturn, Wood stated that ARK Investment will continue to invest in ""innovation"", a move that has led her to invest in companies she views as being poised to thrive in difficult times.

This belief in innovation has led Wood to invest billions into companies such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). While many view some of her investments as unprofitable, her flagship fund has nonetheless captured the attention of investors. According to Bloomberg in June, the Ark Innovation ETF posted its longest streak of inflows during that month in more than a year. About $639 million was invested into the $9.5 billion ETF over an eight-day span.

The continued stream of cash poured into Wood's flagship fund signifies the conviction investors hold in Wood's investment history and strategy. The Ark Innovation ETF rose by 14% this June, and continues to survive in a high-inflation environment. Many investors and ETF issuers now continue to support and follow Wood, in light of her investment returns and success. Let's now take a look at the top 12 stocks from Cathie Wood's Q2 portfolio.

Most notably, crypto market cap has declined from a peak of ~$3 Trillion last fall, to ~$1.1 Trillion today (a -63% decline, and -72% peak-to-trough; LINK). Crypto is a volatile asset class, and has experienced many draw-downs of similar magnitude in the past. For example, Bitcoin was down -93% during 2011, -85% from 2013-15, and -84% from 2017-18. In this context, the latest draw-down is a pretty normal outcome for this emerging asset class.

A large reason for this volatility, is simply because there aren’t any major “real-world use cases” for the asset just yet. In our letter outlining the investment last year, we wrote that crypto is still “in the middle of ‘crossing the chasm’ into mainstream adoption & use cases, which will result in millions of mainstream users needing to transact crypto in some form”…” (Click here to see the full text)

Volkswagen AG's (OTC: VWAGY) luxury brand has won pre-orders exceeding the shares on offer at a valuation between 60 billion and 85 billion euros ($85 billion) despite the Russia-Ukraine crisis, soaring energy prices, and galloping inflation. Porsche looks to share its Frankfurt IPO plans in the first week of September. Porsche attracted bigwig investors, including T. Rowe Price Group, Inc (NASDAQ: TROW)and Qatar Investment Authority. It also drew billionaires, including the founder of energy drink maker Red Bull, Dietrich Mateschitz, and LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTC: LVMUY) Chairman Bernard Arnault. Porsche reportedly has enough demand to fill the shadow order book at the top end of the range and is oversubscribed at the lower end. IPO investors will be able to buy preferred shares in Porsche without any voting rights. The report added that powerful billionaire Porsche and Piech clan, which controls VW through voting stock, would receive a special dividend to fund buying a blocking minority stake in Porsche. Earlier, VW CFO Arno Antlitz assured plenty of investor appetite and capital for an IPO. Volkswagen is also amid an expensive transition to electric vehicles akin to its peers. VW has been losing its share in its biggest market due to poor handling of the chip crisis and lack of digital features. In contrast, after quickly turning the Shanghai plant into its most productive globally, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) added factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin this year.

745,10 Stocks At Risk From Slowing Chinese Economy,"In this article, we discuss 10 stocks at risk from the slowing Chinese economy. If you want to read about some more stocks at risk from the slowing Chinese economy, go directly to 5 Stocks At Risk From Slowing Chinese Economy.

The Chinese economy is witnessing a sharp slowdown in growth as the collapse of the real estate market threatens to spread to other sectors already under heavy pressure due to the strict pandemic policies of the Chinese government. In an effort to deflect a looming recession, Beijing recently announced plans to add $44 billion in credit support to policy banks. The measures are aimed at increasing investment, boosting consumption, and helping keep economic activities on a steady course.

Some of the stocks expected to come under pressure amid these China uncertainties include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). Chinese premier Li Keqiang has also introduced other measures to jumpstart the Chinese economy. These include RMB 500 billion in funds for local governments and RMB 200 billion of bond issuance by state-owned electricity groups. The growth target for the Chinese economy, despite these measures, is 5.5% this year, the lowest in thirty years.

US investment advisors are also warning about the risks that a slowdown in China might have on the stock market. Investment bank Goldman Sachs projects the Chinese economy to grow by a modest 3% this year. Although the bank expects a government stimulus to offset sharp contraction in government revenue and support infrastructure investment growth, it forecasts that a weak property sector and headwinds to activity growth from local virus outbreaks will result in a sluggish Chinese economy this year.

Our Methodology

The companies that have deep links with the Chinese economy were selected for the list. The business fundamentals of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

Stocks At Risk From Slowing Chinese Economy

10. XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24

XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) makes and sells electric vehicles. On August 23, the firm posted earnings for the second quarter of 2022, reporting losses per share of $0.43, missing analyst expectations by $0.10. The revenue over the period was $1.1 billion, up more than 97% compared to the revenue over the same period last year. As EV competition heats up and the Chinese economy slows, the revenue and delivery guidance numbers of the firm for 2023 have taken a hit, falling short of analyst expectations.

On August 24, Citi analyst Jeff Chung maintained a Buy rating on XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) stock and lowered the price target to $27.87 from $51.59, noting that the pandemic, consumption downgrade, and supply chain challenges would weigh on the firm in the near-term.

At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 24 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $618 million in XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV), compared to 26 in the preceding quarter worth $783 million.

Just like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) is one of the stocks feeling the heat of an economic slowdown in China.

9. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25

NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) makes and sells smart electric vehicles. In addition to pressures related to a drop in EV demand in China due to a slowing economy, the company also faces headwinds from a potential delisting risk from the New York Stock Exchange in light of new US rules for Chinese firms with regards to independent audits. Ongoing supply chain concerns are also expected to weigh heavily on the stock, like other automakers, in the coming months. The fundamentals of the firm, though, have shown resilience under these pressures so far.

On August 23, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu maintained a Buy rating on NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stock with a price target of $45, noting that the overseas expansion of the firm was under-appreciated in the marketplace.

At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 25 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $873 million in NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), compared to 26 in the preceding quarter worth $716 million.

8. NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26

NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTES) provides interactive home entertainment services. On August 18, the firm posted earnings for the second quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $1.22, beating estimates by $0.17. The revenue over the period was $3.5 billion, up over 12% year-on-year. The online gaming revenue of the firm showed weakness during the quarter as gaming sales across the world took a major hit. A slowing Chinese economy is expected to further impact gaming revenue in the coming months.

On August 19, Citi analyst Alicia Yap maintained a Buy rating on NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) stock and raised the price target to $140 from $132, appreciating the solid second quarter earnings of the firm.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Bermuda-based investment firm Orbis Investment Managementis a leading shareholder in NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES), with 3.6 million shares worth more than $342 million.

7. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26

Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a Las Vegas-based corporation that owns and operates luxury hotels and casinos. The firm generates over 70% of revenue from the Macau region in China, and a slowdown in the Chinese economy will directly impact business in the region. The firm has already missed market estimates on revenue for the second quarter of 2022 by $72 million. In the coming months, COVID-related uncertainties in Macau will add to revenue pressures on the firm.

On August 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli maintained a Buy rating on Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) stock and lowered the price target to $85 from $92, noting that the firm had reported better than expected Las Vegas and Encore Boston Harbor metrics.

At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 26 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $142 million in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), compared to 32 the preceding quarter worth $269 million.

In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“In the most recent quarter, we exited the Fund’s holdings in Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)  due to: (i) ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions in China, Macau, and Singapore; and (ii) the Macau government’s announcement to tighten its casino regulatory oversight.”

6. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45

Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) provides internet search services. Although a slowing Chinese economy, pandemic pressures, and regulatory crackdowns by Beijing have impacted the shares of the firm in recent months, the stock has seen some respite in the past few weeks after US regulators signed a preliminary deal with Chinese regulators on audits to reduce the delisting risk of Chinese firms in the US. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is one of the most valuable firms in China and could be one of the first-hit if a slowdown in the economy spreads to the tech sector.

On August 23, Macquarie analyst Esme Pau maintained an Outperform rating on Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) stock with a price target of $188, noting that the firm was the leading search platform and artificial intelligence company in China.

At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 45 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2 billion in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), compared to 47 in the preceding quarter worth $1.5 billion.

Along with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is one of the stocks that elite investors are monitoring as the Chinese economy slows.

In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Horos Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Although the initial reaction of the Chinese government was passive, it seems that the blacklist published by the SEC, which already includes companies as important as the technology giant Baidu, has shaken things up. Thus, at the beginning of April the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors, provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed, as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over, and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information.

While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. In this regard, some companies are already listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, as is the case of the three major technology companies (Alibaba Group, Tencent Holdings and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)).”

BRIAN SOZZI: OK, before we head to break, let's call up shares of Tesla. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rozner is out positive on Tesla after spending a week with Tesla's team at the new Berlin gigafactory. Sounds like an awesome trip. Says Rozner, we came away with the sense that Tesla's new localized vehicle production in Europe could be a game-changer. Making Tesla an even more formidable competitor in the region, while likely boosting the company's gross margins.

750,7 EV Stocks to Buy Ahead of a Green Tidal Wave,"Through the Democratic budget bill that was recently signed into law, the U.S. government has adopted an aggressive, pro-growth policy that’s designed to fight climate change. Support for the electric vehicle (EV) sector is central to the legislation, which is known as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The bill includes $369 billion of  provisions related to climate and energy, including a great deal of support for the EV sector. Given the implications of the IRA, it’s a very good time to identify superb EV stocks to buy. EV Stocks to buy

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As shown by the table above, the most prominent EV stocks have unappealing valuations for now, according to Stock Rover. Their value will become more attractive when investors pour additional funds into the sector.

EV makers that are eligible for tax credits within the IRA will benefit the most from the legislation. Only companies that assemble EVs  in North America are now eligible for the $7,500 tax credit.

But investors should not ignore the manufacturers that are not eligible for the tax credit, since some of these names are still good EV stocks to buy and will enable investors to take advantage of the transition to EVs that will take a decade to unfold.

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) is accelerating its pivot from making gasoline-powered vehicles to manufacturing EVs. On Aug. 22 Ford cut 3,000 jobs, mostly in the U.S., Canada, and India.

Ford is reducing its costs to ensure that it has enough funds to transition to electric vehicles.

Importantly, Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the automaker’s quarterly conference call that the  demand for its EVs has been overwhelming.

Story continues

Among Ford’s very popular EVs are the Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning, and the E-Transit. Ford has received a high number of orders for those models for the next few years.

Fortunately, the automaker expects to increase its monthly production steadily. Since it is selling its EVs immediately after they are completed, investors should expect Ford’s EV revenue to grow rapidly. Indeed, Farley anticipates that Ford’s EV sales will climb twice as quickly as the global EV average through 2026.

Fisker (NYSE:FSR) revised its production plans after the IRA was passed. Specifically, the firm will now explore U.S. manufacturing sites and will consider increasing its production of the Fisker Ocean in late 2023.

Fisker is confident that it will sell all of the EVs that it produces, as it has received more than 58,000  reservations from consumers, each of whom paid a $5,000 deposit.

Investors might worry about  inflation raising the cost of Fisker’s commodities. On the automaker’s recent earnings conference call, CEO Henrik Fisker said that, since the company is not yet producing EVs, the higher costs are not yet affecting it at this time. That frees the company to focus on several different prototypes.

Henrik Fisker said the company has already built 55 prototypes, tested all of them, and reviewed their design. This suggests that Fisker is well-positioned to meet its vehicle-production schedule.

By 2025, the firm will have four vehicles on the market, but it will need capital to fund those programs. Bears are betting that Fisker will have to sell more shares, diluting shareholders and putting pressure on the stock.  Almost 34% of the stock’s float is being sold short. If the short sellers are proven wrong, a short squeeze would send FSR stock much higher.

Lucid Group (LCID) A photo of the Lucid Motors Air EV from 2018.

Only two analysts are covering LCID stock. Their average price target is $23.00,   42% above its current level.

The luxury EV supplier is nowhere near profitability. In Q2, Lucid lowered its 2022 production guidance. It reported revenue of $97.3 million after delivering 679 vehicles in the period.

Lucid can reward investors over the long-term, as it reported that it had received  over 37,000 reservations for its EVs. If  all of those EVs are sold, they would generate revenue of nearly $3.5 billion for the automaker.

Patient investors should consider waiting for the markets to punish LCID stock for Lucid’s weak guidance, as the firm cut its 2022 production guidance. It now expects to produce 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles, down from 12,000 to 14,000 previously. Lucid blamed bottlenecks, logistics challenges, and the supply chain for the reduction.

The company ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash. It has more than enough funds to last through 2023.

The demand for its EVs may stall if they do not qualify for America’s $7,500 tax credit. But Lucid is taking steps to help its customers qualify for the credit.

Mullen Automotive (MULN) An image of a charging station for an EV on a dark background; EV stock

Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) had around $99 million of cash and cash equivalents as of the end of Q2.

In the quarter, Mullen nearly tripled its research and development spending. In addition, it advanced its solid-state battery technology.

The company signed a binding agreement with DelPack Logistics, LLC. The customer is an Amazon Delivery Services Partner that will buy up to 600 of Mullen Class 1 EVs plus 2 EV cargo vans in the next 18 months.

Given its low market capitalization of $346.5 million, MULN stock is risky. Its operations will require more cash, and weak stock market conditions will hurt the firm’s ability to raise funds.

Still, investors who believe Mullen can launch successful, new solid-state batteries may consider buying its shares.

Polestar Automotive (PSNY)

Polestar Automotive (NASDAQ:PSNY)  more than doubled its deliveries in the first half of 2022 to 21,200 cars.

Polestar reported a 350% YOY increase of its global orders to 50,000. It also expects to deliver 50,000 units. CEO Thomas Ingenlath is confident that Polestar’s sales will accelerate, as its brand awareness and new model releases will drive demand for the EVs in the coming years. The company’s global expansion will increase its addressable market.

In the first six months of 2022, it operated in 25 markets, up from 19 previously. Its retail locations increased from 103 to 125. By the end of 2022, Polestar will add another 30 retail locations.

To attract enthusiasts, Poletar announced a roadster concept vehicle. The Polestar O2 is eye-catching. It showcases the vehicle maker’s bonded aluminum platform. Once the media writes glowing reviews of this vehicle, they could drive demand for the EV when Polestar releases it next year.

Rivian Automotive (RIVN) rivn stock sign outside the company's HQ in Silicon Valley

Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) posted second-quarter revenue of $364 million. It lost $1.89 per share.

The company reaffirmed its 2022 production guidance of 25,000 EVs. However, it revised its full-year EBITDA guidance to -$5.45 billion. Rivian said it would continue to adopt its production to the unfavorable economic outlook. For example, it will reduce its operating expenses and its capital expenditures.

Rivian ended Q2 with $15 billion of cash. The company is in a good position financially to launch the R2 vehicle platform with the cash that it has on hand.

But investors need to watch for inflationary pressures on commodities. As of the end of Q2, raw material inputs and lithium prices had risen by over 115% since the start of the year.

If high prices persist,  Rivian’s long-term gross profit margins will be pressured. By 2024, Rivian will have sold 150,000 EVs. It will realize economies of scale as it leverages its fixed overhead and costs.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) made its stock more affordable for retail investors with a stock split on Aug. 25. TSLA is due to post its production and demand figures in late September.

Earlier in the year, China’s anti-Covid policies disrupted the output of Tesla’s Shanghai factory. With the lockdown over, investors should expect strong productivity from this facility.

Tesla cut the delivery waiting time for its Model Y in China to between four weeks and eight weeks. Once the company figures out how to increase the output of its Texas and Berlin plants, its share of the EV market will accelerate.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would hike the prices of its Full Self-Driving System (or FSD) to $15,000, up from $12,000. That will have a positive impact on Tesla’s profit margins and increase Tesla’s cash flow, enabling it to invest further in FSD. As a result, Tesla will widen its lead against competitors who cannot offer the same level of autonomy.

751,"Tesla stock is set to rip higher, analyst says after visiting Germany Gigafactory","After spending a week in Berlin touring Tesla's new Gigafactory, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner is feeling even more upbeat on Tesla stock.

Here are the key details of a new bullish note from Rosner on the EV maker:

Price Target: $375 Rating: Buy Upside Assumed: around 24% Tesla stock movement on Monday midday: Down around 1% amid broader market pressure on high-beta stocks

""We hosted investors last week in Berlin for a guided tour of Tesla’s new Gigafactory, test drives of the Model Y Performance at high speed on the Autobahn, and a meeting with Head of IR Martin Viecha,"" Rosner wrote. ""We came away with the sense that Tesla’s new localized vehicle production in Europe could be a game-changer, making Tesla to an even more formidable competitor in the region, while likely boosting the company’s gross margins. The plant is already capacitized to produce 500k Model Y per year, but currently only staffed with 2 shifts; Tesla plans to increase to 4 shifts and full production sometime in 2023.""

From the Yahoo Finance Live Archive: Rosner talking Tesla on July 5

He added that the company acknowledged production risk related to a potential gas crisis in Germany amid the Ukraine-Russia war while also asserting that the company has flexibility in terms of global vehicle production.

""More broadly, Tesla commented that demand for its vehicles remains strong, outpacing its ability to supply,"" Rosner added. ""This is certainly the case in the US, and could become even more acute after the [Inflation Reduction Act] takes effect in January 2023. ... our view is that it can see solid benefit from IRA and potentially qualify for 3 large sources of subsidies: tax credits to EV buyers (up to $7,500 per vehicle), subsidies to EV battery cell producers in the US ($35/kWh), and subsidies to US producers of battery modules and packs ($10/kWh). All in, we believe 2023 could be a pivotal year for Tesla and continue to view it as one of the most attractive stories in the autos sector.""

Story continues Model Y cars are pictured during the opening ceremony of the new Tesla Gigafactory for electric cars in Gruenheide, Germany, March 22, 2022. Patrick Pleul/Pool via REUTERS

Deutsche Bank estimates that Tesla is ""on track for 1.4 million units for the full year, which is up 50%,"" the note stated. ""And they've also done an incredible job pricing up for some of the raw materials pressure. And so we think the margins could actually look good going forward.""

753,U.S board: 'Unlawful' for Tesla to prevent employees from wearing union shirts,"WASHINGTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Monday said it was unlawful for Tesla to prohibit employees from wearing shirts bearing union insignia.

In a 3-2 decision, the NLRB said that when companies interfere with employees' rights to display union insignia the employer ""has the burden to establish special circumstances that make the rule necessary to maintain production or discipline. The majority then found that Tesla failed to establish special circumstances in this case.""

754,U.S. agency: 'unlawful' for Tesla to prevent employees from wearing union shirts,"By Doyinsola Oladipo

(Reuters) -The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) said on Monday it was unlawful for Tesla Inc to prohibit employees from wearing shirts bearing union insignia, ruling in a 2017 dispute between the electric car maker and the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union.

NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran said the decision reaffirms ""any attempt to restrict the wearing of union clothing or insignia is presumptively unlawful and – consistent with Supreme Court precedent – an employer has a heightened burden to justify attempts to limit this important right.""

In a 3-2 decision, the NLRB said that when companies interfere with employees' rights to display union insignia the employer ""has the burden to establish special circumstances"" and the majority ""found that Tesla failed to establish special circumstances in this case.""

Tesla and the UAW did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In addition to ruling on the Tesla case, the NLRB also reversed a 2019 decision by the agency involving Walmart Inc, saying the earlier decision ""ignored decades of board precedent.""

The previous ruling by the NLRB had said Walmart's justification for restricting union insignia on the selling floor to enhance the customer shopping experience and prevent theft or vandalism was legitimate. The NLRB in 2019 did, however, acknowledge the potential interference with employees’ rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

The 2019 decision set a precedent for employers across the country to have more control over limiting union apparel.

Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NLRB said some Tesla employees assembling electric vehicles at its Fremont, California, plant wore shirts with union logos during a 2017 UAW union organizing campaign. At that time, the UAW was seeking to represent workers at Tesla’s facility in Fremont, who are not unionized.

Tesla's ""team-wear"" policy required employees to wear black shirts imprinted with the Tesla logo or their own black T-shirts without logo. The NLRB found that this implicitly prohibited employees from substituting any shirt with a logo or emblem, including a shirt bearing union insignia. The NLRB said that before 2017 Tesla production employees regularly wore shirts that were not black or had logos and emblems unrelated to Tesla. On Monday, it ordered Tesla to rescind its policy prohibiting employees from wearing black union shirts. This is not the first clash between Tesla and the NLRB. In 2021, the NLRB said that a 2018 tweet by CEO Elon Musk, in which he threatened that Tesla employees who formed a union would lose their stock options, was illegal and should be deleted.

755,The 3 Worst EV Stocks You Can Buy Right Now,"In the aftermath of the Covid-19-induced sell-off in the first quarter of 2020, high-growth stocks sprung to life. In particular, EV stocks charged higher. As investors soured on growth stocks, though, the highest fliers became some of the recent bear market’s biggest losers. And while there may be opportunities in some of the more established players, investors should avoid the worst EV stocks or risk further losses.

There’s a big difference between buying shares of a major EV company like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or a large automaker that’s transitioning into EVs like Ford (NYSE:F) and investing in a pre- or early-production company. Auto production is capital-intensive. Companies need cash in the bank to keep the business afloat, especially during rocky economic periods. Those that have yet to generate any revenue, let alone turn a profit, are likely to struggle.

With that in mind, here are three of the worst EV stocks you could buy right now.

NKLA Nikola $6.01 RIDE Lordstown Motors $2.05 SOLO Electrameccanica Vehicles $1.52

Electric truck maker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) is expected to generate a meager $110 million in sales for 2022 after producing no revenue last year. However, it’s the lies and deceit that accompanied the company’s early days that put this name on my list of the worst EV stocks to own.

Nikola founder and former chairman Trevor Milton is about as shady as they come. He is under indictment for multiple counts of fraud and is being accused of lying about “nearly all aspects of the business” to get investors to purchase shares. In December, Nikola reached an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a fine of $125 million to settle charges that it defrauded investors.

Milton stepped down in September 2020 but continues to make headlines, including a new fraud charge and a large purchase of NKLA stock.

Story continues

It remains to be seen whether Nikola can repair its reputation and deliver on any promises. Management says it plans to deliver 300 to 500 trucks this year but investors will have to wait and see.

With dozens of EV stocks to choose from, one that’s had this many problems in its short time as a public company is an easy pass for me. There’s simply too much drama.

When Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) announced its second-quarter results early this month, it reported a $61.3 million operating profit despite no revenue. How is that possible? Apparently, it was due to the roughly $120 million it generated through the sale of one of its plants. That’s not the best way for an automaker to turn a profit, but you gotta do what you gotta do.

The company did end the quarter with $236 million in cash and lowered its minimum capital raise for the year from $150 million to $50 million to $75 million. That’s a solid improvement, particularly as Lordstown gears up for production to begin in the third quarter. However, production could be hampered by lingering supply chain issues and a budding recession.

Management is forecasting an operating loss and capital expenditures of between $140 million and $150 million for the second half of the year and less than $5 million in sales for the full year. That doesn’t leave the EV maker, which has a market cap of $439 million, with a lot of wiggle room.

Maybe it’s just me, but when I look at Electrameccanica Vehicles’ (NASDAQ:SOLO) three-wheeled, single-seat electric vehicle, I don’t see a product that’s likely to find commercial success. While the $18,500 starting price tag makes this vehicle much more affordable than some other options, I just can’t see people wanting to drive these odd-looking things. A lack of demand would obviously limit the company’s chances of sustained long-term growth.

On the plus side, the company had just $17.4 million in debt and over $176 million in cash and equivalents at the end of the second quarter. That’s great! However, debt is up significantly from a year ago while its cash position is down from $250 million. Analysts expect about $7.8 million in sales this year and about $108 million in revenue next year. It is not expected to break even until 2024.

I don’t think the financials do enough to bolster the case for Electrameccanica Vehicles given its products are a dice roll in terms of mass adoption.

756,10 Best Index Funds Popular Among Reddit Investors,"In this article, we discuss the 10 best index funds popular among Reddit investors. If you want to read about more index funds gaining attention on Reddit, go to the 5 Best Index Funds Popular Among Reddit Investors.

The popularity of index funds remains high among investors as they provide ownership of a broad range of equities like (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and reduce the level of risk due to diversification. Retirement accounts like individual retirement accounts and 401(k) accounts are heavily invested in index funds.

Warren Buffett, legendary investor, philanthropist, and CEO of diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK-B), suggests index funds as a refuge for savings for the later stages of life. Instead of singling out stocks for investments, the Oracle of Omaha recommends picking out all the stocks from the S&P 500 Index at an economical cost through an index fund. In an interview in 2017 with CNBC’s On The Money, Warren Buffett advised investors to “consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund.”

Index funds often perform better than their actively managed alternatives, in large part due to fees. According to Morningstar, an index fund’s average asset-weighted fee in 2020 was 0.12% compared to the active funds charging 0.62%. To match the return of an average index fund, the average active fund must generate an additional 0.5% in returns. The Head of Product Development and Strategy at ICICI Prudential AMC, Chintan Haria, shared that while directly investing in stocks may seem alluring, the level of research that is necessary to pick stocks can be time-consuming. Hence, index fund investing can be seen as a staging post to entering the realm of stock investing.

Since reaching their lows of June 14, index funds have staged a recovery, as the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQGM:QQQ), SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) have regained 17.2%, 12.6%, and 10.3%, respectively. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQGM:QQQ) tracks the performance of the NASDAQ Composite Index. The Trust even entered the bull market during this period, as it surpassed gains of 20%. It must be noted that the average stock in the NASDAQ Composite Index has clawed back over 30% from its lows. It is a significant development, as there was a time when the majority of the stocks were down 50% from their peak.

Improvement related to economic conditions could be a major reason for the change in sentiment. Inflation for July 2022 showed a year-over-year increase of 8.5% as opposed to the consensus forecast of 8.7%. The lower-than-expected number for inflation boosted consumer sentiment, as the University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment index reading for August 2022 was posted at 55.1. This was higher than the median estimate of 52.5, according to data polled from Reuters. The consumer sentiment index reached a record low of 50 in June 2022. 10 Best Index Funds Popular Among Reddit Investors

Let’s begin our list of the 10 best index funds popular among Reddit investors. Notable Reddit forums were scoured to see which index funds are attracting investors. We also looked at r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/personalfinance, and other forums for stocks and ETFs trading analysis. Furthermore, we have discussed some of the popular stocks being held by these funds and their top 10 holdings. These index funds have been ranked in terms of their net assets as of August 24.

10 Best Index Funds Popular Among Reddit Investors

10. Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund (NASDAQ:FNILX)

Net Assets: $5.61 billion

The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund (NASDAQ:FNILX) is a fund replicating the performance of large-cap stocks listed on the U.S. equity market through its 515 holdings. The ETF came into being in 2018.

The top 10 holdings of the fund represent 26.32% of the portfolio value. Some of the popular stocks included in the portfolio are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund’s (NASDAQ:FNILX) average 3-year return stands at over 13.14% as of August 24.

The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund (NASDAQ:FNILX) is popular among Reddit users as it does not charge any fees to its investors. This is done so that consumers will be attracted to other financial products offered by Fidelity. Although the fund tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index, it has not included the term “S&P” in its name because Standard and Poor’s charges a licensing fee of 0.03% of funds under management along with a fixed charge of $600,000. By not keeping S&P in its name, the fund can bypass the 0.03% expense ratio. However, the fund still tracks the S&P 500 Index very closely.

9. ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK)

Net Assets: $9.34 billion

The ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is an exchange-traded fund that has at least 65% of its investments in the field of disruptive innovation.

The ETF falls under the helm of Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management and defines disruptive innovation as a new product or service that is introduced due to advancement in technology and which modifies the way the world works. The ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) has an annual management fee of 0.75% and is targeting industries focusing on automation, artificial intelligence, financial technology, and DNA technologies.

During a five-working-day period that ended on August 15, investors bought $54.2 million worth of ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), according to VandaTrack. This was the fastest accumulation of the ETF during a five-working-day period since May 2022. Interestingly, the ARK Innovation ETF outperformed the shares of diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK-B) during July, as it gained 9.5% as compared to the Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s rise of 8.3%.

8. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYG)

Net Assets: $14.38 billion

The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYG) is an ETF focusing on companies in the widely popular S&P 500 Index that offer the most stellar growth prospects. The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYG) has around 240 stocks in its portfolio and has a heavy focus on the information technology sector, followed by consumer discretionary, healthcare, communication services, and seven other sectors. The ETF is popular among Reddit investors as it offers a significantly low annual expense ratio of 0.04% and has a healthy daily average trading volume of over 2.75 million shares.

According to the latest data available, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) take up over 38% of the ETF’s holdings as of August 19. Meanwhile, the ETF's top 10 holdings represent more than 49% of the portfolio's value. Although the ETF has underperformed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) since the start of the year and in the last full year, it has outperformed the broader market over the past three and five years, respectively.

7. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA)

Net Assets: $28.46 billion

The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) looks to replicate the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which comprises 30 blue-chip U.S.-based stocks.

The index has a long history of over a century and is one of the three leading market indices in the U.S. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) has an annual expense ratio of 0.16% as of August 24. The DJIA is a price-weighted index in which UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) take up 29.42% of the fund’s holdings. Meanwhile, the top 10 holdings represent 55% of the ETF’s portfolio.

Redditors believe that the 30 blue-chip stocks in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) have strong fundamentals and can weather extreme economic uncertainty compared to average companies. Many of those 30 companies have a defensive business model and are known for making consistent dividend payouts to investors. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) offers a very different profile from the S&P 500 Index in terms of sector holdings.

6. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD)

Net Assets: $36.75 billion

The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) is an ETF that tracks the performance of the Dow Jones US Dividend 100 Index and offers a yield of nearly 3.2% as of August 24. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD), founded in 2011, has a track record of outperforming during both bear and bull markets. Furthermore, the fund has even held its ground during recessions. However, the fund’s short history does not include any period reflecting the current circumstances of multi-decade-high inflation.

Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) are the four biggest holdings in the ETF. These companies represent a combined stake of 17.3%, while the top 10 holdings take up 40.96% of the fund’s portfolio.

The fund appears to be popular among Reddit investors as it includes stocks that have been paying out dividends for the past ten consecutive years, have a market capitalization of at least $500 million, and fulfill certain requirements related to fundamentals and liquidity. Furthermore, the ETF does not include any master limited partnerships or and real estate investment trusts.

757,Tesla hit with proposed class action over phantom braking issue,"By Tom Hals and Hyunjoo Jin

WILMINGTON, Del./SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A California owner of a Tesla Model 3 sued the electric vehicle maker in a proposed class action over cars suddenly stopping for non-existent obstacles, calling it a ""frightening and dangerous nightmare,"" according to the lawsuit.

Tesla has rushed its autonomous driving cars to market with unsafe technology, including its driver assistant system which the company calls Autopilot or Full Self-Driving, and its emergency braking system, according to the lawsuit by Jose Alvarez Toledo of San Francisco.

This adds to growing public and regulatory scrutiny of Tesla's driver assistant technology, despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk promising full self-driving by this year-end.

""When the sudden unintended braking defect occurs, they turn what is supposed to be a safety feature into a frightening and dangerous nightmare,"" said Toledo's lawsuit, which was filed on Friday in federal court in the northern district of California.

The lawsuit seeks class action status for all U.S. owners or leasors of a Tesla that suffers from the sudden unintended braking defect.

Tesla did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comments.

In February, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into 416,000 Tesla vehicles over reports of unexpected brake activation tied to Autopilot.

The lawsuit accused Tesla of fraudulently hiding the safety risks associated with Autopilot, breaching its warranties, unfairly profiting from Autopilot and violating California's unfair competition law.

The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for expenses to repair vehicles, diminished value of Tesla cars and for a refund of the added cost attributed to the Autopilot feature, according to the lawsuit.

760,Elon Musk subpoenas Twitter whistleblower for bot and security info,"Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley details how Tesla CEO Elon Musk's legal team has issued more than 100 subpoenas in its ongoing lawsuit with Twitter.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Elon musk's legal team has subpoenaed former Twitter head of security and whistleblower Peter Zatko. Yahoo finance's Dan Howley has the details for us. Dan?

DAN HOWLEY: That's right, Seana. Elon Musk is trying to subpoena the information that the whistleblower has on Twitter, including information about bots as well as the security that the company had set in place and whether or not it complied with an FTC consent decree basically telling the company that it needed to put security in place at all and that it needed to ensure that its user data was protected.

Now, what we know about the bots so far is basically all that Twitter has been saying the whole time, that they claim that of monetizable daily active users, 5% or less are bots. Now, Elon Musk has repeatedly said that that's not true, and that it could be as high as 20% or more of those users.

Now, where we get into the weeds here is where the whistleblower says, Twitter has done a good job of getting rid of bots when it comes to monetizable daily active users but not when it comes to overall Twitter user numbers. And so there's two conversations kind of going on here, how many bots there are in general and how many bots there are in that monetizable daily active user pool. And so this is something that we're going to have to see go back and forth in court.

And whether or not it actually has any benefit for Musk really remains to be seen. Some experts have said that, look, this does shoot a hole in Twitter's argument that it is aware of how many bots are on the platform. Others have said Zatko, the whistleblower, says you know that they had no idea how many bots there are on the platform in general and that they had no real reason or desire to figure out how many they had because that could make them look bad in front of advertisers as well as other users.

Story continues

So all of this information now is going to be going towards this big face-off that we have between Twitter and Elon Musk and whether or not he will eventually be forced to purchase the social network. Back to you guys.

DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Yahoo Finance tech reporter Dan Howley, thank you. Let's discuss more on this and what it means for Elon Musk as they prepare for that trial in Delaware, October 17 in that Chancery Court. It means not much, if I'm going to go ahead and play a lawyer here. Due diligence, the only two words that matter to me in this case, Seana, he waived due diligence.

And I know I've been beating that drum since the very beginning. But ultimately, what this whistleblower has said on paper and may say when they subpoena him, might even say it in court, has no bearing on what Elon Musk's issues are because he did not look deeper. He did not tie the number of bots to his purchase of this company. He was willingly accepting of their estimates. And their estimates were vague at best.

Their SEC filing, Twitter's SEC filing, was very vague and, even in the wording, acknowledged, we might not be correct on that. I think that judge is largely going to say, who cares unless they willingly and knowingly lied to the SEC. Now, that's a whole different animal, which we're not going to dive into, because we have no concept if that's the case. But it seems like, from the very beginning, Twitter has said, hey, this is just our guess here. We're not really sure to how to measure this. I don't think it has any bearing.

SEANA SMITH: Well, exactly. And that's Twitter's exact argument here. And that's what we heard from Twitter's attorney in the latest thing, saying that this is legally irrelevant. That was a direct quote from what he was saying. He's saying that we know that Twitter has always said that there are spam counts. Like you're saying, they have only always been estimates. They have said they have always been estimates, not binding representation.

So Rachelle, there are both sides. Now some are saying that this whistleblower coming out, making these claims that it does strengthens Elon Musk's argument, I have a tough time buying that. I mean, it definitely has us all talking about it and saying that maybe it's not as clear-cut as we initially thought it was a couple of weeks ago ahead of these revelations. But I'm not so sure that it actually materially will change the outcome of this when it heads to trial later this fall.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, I will say, it could depend what lies outside of due diligence. If there was something material that he wouldn't have been able to discover in the course of due diligence, there may be a bit of wiggle room there. But I mean, if you go into something this casually, you sort of tweet about the idea of buying a company, you want to spend that much money, you have to do the due diligence.

And I will say for Twitter, it does open a can of worms because congress wants to hear from this whistleblower because they're saying that there might be issues about the network misleading regulators about cyber defenses and efforts to control some of these things. There could be broader impacts. So he might win the sort of moral high ground when it comes to selling Twitter, look, I put you on blast. But he might get stuck with a very big bill if he has to purchase this company.

DAVE BRIGGS: I see no way around it. And look, when you have teams of lawyers and you are the richest man in the world, that does not buy you a lot of sympathy in that courtroom. Now, to your point, if this goes into a lawsuit phase down the road because Elon's not going to take that judgment quietly, discovery would be a whole different animal for both Twitter and Tesla and everyone involved in this. That is something no one wants here.",2022-08-29T19:31:14+00:00,2022-08-29
761,UPDATE 3-U.S. agency: 'unlawful' for Tesla to prevent employees from wearing union shirts,"(Adds details on Walmart case)

By Doyinsola Oladipo

Aug 29 (Reuters) - The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) said on Monday it was unlawful for Tesla Inc to prohibit employees from wearing shirts bearing union insignia, ruling in a 2017 dispute between the electric car maker and the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union.

NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran said the decision reaffirms ""any attempt to restrict the wearing of union clothing or insignia is presumptively unlawful and – consistent with Supreme Court precedent – an employer has a heightened burden to justify attempts to limit this important right.""

In a 3-2 decision, the NLRB said that when companies interfere with employees' rights to display union insignia the employer ""has the burden to establish special circumstances"" and the majority ""found that Tesla failed to establish special circumstances in this case.""

Tesla and the UAW did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In addition to ruling on the Tesla case, the NLRB also reversed a 2019 decision by the agency involving Walmart Inc , saying the earlier decision ""ignored decades of board precedent.""

The previous ruling by the NLRB had said Walmart's justification for restricting union insignia on the selling floor to enhance the customer shopping experience and prevent theft or vandalism was legitimate. The NLRB in 2019 did, however, acknowledge the potential interference with employees’ rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

The 2019 decision set a precedent for employers across the country to have more control over limiting union apparel.

Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The NLRB said some Tesla employees assembling electric vehicles at its Fremont, California, plant wore shirts with union logos during a 2017 UAW union organizing campaign. At that time, the UAW was seeking to represent workers at Tesla’s facility in Fremont, who are not unionized.

Story continues

Tesla's ""team-wear"" policy required employees to wear black shirts imprinted with the Tesla logo or their own black T-shirts without logo. The NLRB found that this implicitly prohibited employees from substituting any shirt with a logo or emblem, including a shirt bearing union insignia.

The NLRB said that before 2017 Tesla production employees regularly wore shirts that were not black or had logos and emblems unrelated to Tesla. On Monday, it ordered Tesla to rescind its policy prohibiting employees from wearing black union shirts.

This is not the first clash between Tesla and the NLRB.

In 2021, the NLRB said that a 2018 tweet by CEO Elon Musk, in which he threatened that Tesla employees who formed a union would lose their stock options, was illegal and should be deleted.

763,"Cyber expert on Twitter whistleblower: 'If allegations are true,' accounts at-risk","Twitter (TWTR) whistleblower Peiter Zatko, the company's former security chief, recently charged that the company misled regulators and is operating with security vulnerabilities. If true, the safety of Twitter users' accounts could be in jeopardy, according to cyber threat expert Tony Anscombe (video above).

""If the allegations are true, yes, there's probably an increased risk,"" said Anscombe, who's Chief Cyber Threat Officer at Slovakia-based cybersecurity software provider ESET.

This month, Zatko went public with his claims that many of Twitter's security practices are negligent, that the company has let its bot problems fester, and that Twitter has repeatedly misled the Federal Trade Commission—and the company's directors—about the platform's safety. The bottom line: Zatko's allegations may suggest that users' data is vulnerable, even for deleted accounts, said Anscombe.

""There's some very serious allegations about whether data is being encrypted, whether the company has patched servers... and whether they're cyber resilient, and some of those are fundamental to every business in cybersecurity,"" he told Yahoo Finance.

Amid Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's now-withdrawn $44 billion bid for the company – and the subsequent legal battle that's in-progress – Twitter shares have been on a roller coaster this year-to-date. Over the last twelve months, Twitter's shares are down almost 40%.

(Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)

It seems like Twitter's taking heat from all sides right now. Zatko's allegations and Musk's lawsuit are already crossing over – Musk's lawyers have subpoenaed Zatko to speak to Twitter's failures when it comes to the proliferation of bots, an issue Musk has cited in his efforts to renege on the deal. The company has also frozen most hiring, rescinded job offers, and laid off 30% of its talent acquisition team earlier this summer.

However, there are silver linings. For one, Twitter isn't data-heavy for many users unlike, say, Meta Platforms' (META) Instagram or Facebook.

Story continues

""I would say that Twitter isn't a platform where we overshare lots of personal information. It's not a full social media play in that way,"" said Anscombe.

Additionally, in the case of Zatko and the concerns he's publicized about Twitter's cyber safety, there's good news for consumers.

""One thing I think is a takeaway is that when somebody makes an allegation of this type, it's actually good for the user of that business,"" he said. ""If the allegations are unfounded, then the company's probably running an audit anyway to make sure that they haven't got any weaknesses and, if they are founded, they're running around fixing those things. So, actually, the end result is a good thing.""

Twitter shares closed at $40 a share on Monday. Musk's original bid for Twitter shook out to $54.20 per share.

768,"Musk, Twitter Both Subpoena Bot Whistle-Blower in Buyout Dispute","(Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for both Elon Musk and Twitter Inc. subpoenaed a whistle-blower who says the social-media platform’s officials didn’t know or care to find out how many accounts were spam or robot accounts as the billionaire seeks to cancel a $44 billion buyout of the company.

Peiter Zatko, Twitter’s ex-head of security, said in a whistle-blower complaint last week that the company had “egregious deficiencies” in its defenses against hackers and lacked concern for privacy issues. Zatko also said he raised concerns to company officials about the number of bots on the system and claimed those apprehensions were ignored.

Musk seeks testimony from Zatko to bolster his legal argument he can walk away from the Twitter deal over the bot issue. Twitter sued Musk in July to force him to complete his proposed acquisition. Since then, more than 100 people, banks, funds and other firms have been subpoenaed in the Delaware suit, with a trial scheduled to begin Oct. 17.

The billionaire filed a court document Monday saying he’d subpoenaed Zatko, followed later in the day with a similar filing by Twitter. Zatko is also scheduled to testify before a US Senate committee Sept. 13 about his allegations.

A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment Monday. Last week, the company called Zatko’s complaint “a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.” Whistleblower Aid, the group representing Zatko, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Story continues

The subpoenas are aimed at getting Zatko to hand over documents about his bot concerns and anything else he knows about Twitter’s metrics for evaluating customers that can be “monetized” for advertising purposes. The information demand also zeros in on what Zatko knows about Twitter’s securities filings, particularly its statements about bots making up about 5% of its customer base, according to court filings.

Musk’s lawyers said last week they’d already subpoenaed Zatko, but no record of the information demand was on the court docket until Monday.

In the complaint, Zatko said Twitter’s “Integrity Team” was reluctant to dig deeply into how many bot accounts were included in the platform’s customer base. That left the former security executive thinking “the company had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots, in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.”

Musk has argued Twitter’s regulatory disclosures putting spam and bot accounts at no more than 5% of its customer base were misleading. The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer has made public some of his analysis of the issue, which holds that a full third of Twitter’s more than 230 million users may fall into the bot category.

If that’s the case, Musk contends it creates a material adverse event that justifies him cancelling his $54.20-a-share deal under Delaware law. The state is the corporate home of more than half of US public companies, including Twitter and Tesla, along with more than 60% of Fortune 500 firms. Its chancery court judges are business-law experts who hear cases on a fast-track basis.

Also on Monday, depositions were set for Patrick O’Malley and Kristen Salen, two Musk advisers on the Twitter deal, for later this week. O’Malley must appear for in-person questioning at the Wachtell Lipton law firm in New York on Aug. 30, and Salen, a former World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. executive, was set to appear on Aug. 31, court filings show.

The case is Twitter v. Musk, 22-0613, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

(An earlier version corrected the size of the buyout deal.)

771,"Tesla Continues to Challenge the Auto Industry’s Business Model on Multiple Levels, Says Analyst","Tesla’s (TSLA) three-for-one stock split failed to ignite a rally last week but following investor meetings and a trip to Berlin's new facility, Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois remains convinced Tesla is “leading industry transformation with a business model driven by resource efficiency.”

The talks with Tesla’s Head of Investor Relations Martin Viecha focused on “capacity build and further reduction in COGS/unit” while the opening of the Berlin and Austin facilities will go toward helping “dilute” the higher cost Fremont factory.

With a new platform anticipated in 2024, Tesla expects a further reduction in costs. Going by recent comments from CEO Elon Musk, Houchois thinks this will likely be a robotaxi although the analyst understands there is still some “flexibility on product concept.”

Another benefit should come from the Inflation Reduction Act. While Houchois notes the wording “leaves room for interpretation,” he believes it should allow for larger contributions to reduce battery cost/kwh by up to $45. “We see higher vertical battery integration giving Tesla an edge in localizing material sourcing and processing to qualify for cost incentives while sales incentives extend to corporate buyers,” the 5-star analyst further said.

Regarding the Berlin plant, the facility is currently producing 1,000 units per week on 2 shifts/5 days, and the target is to see out the year producing 5,000 a week. Full capacity should see the plant reach 500,000 on 4 shifts/7days.

Finally, with the Cybertruck expected mid-next year and the possibility of a new model hitting the market in late 2024, Houchois thinks the key question is how “many units can be sold with a limited line-up (models and options).”

“With Model Y seen as transcending traditional segments (functionality and affordability through TCO), Tesla sees scope for 3-4m units combined 3 & Y,” the analyst noted. “In our view Tesla continues to challenge the industry's business model at multiple levels including by avoiding resource- and capital-intensive complexity.”

Story continues

All in all, Houchois reiterated a Buy rating on Tesla shares, while his $350 price target makes room for 23% share appreciation over the next 12 months. (To watch Houchois’s track record, click here)

Most on the Street back Houchois’s stance although not all are on board; with 19 Buys, 5 Holds and 6 Sells, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. According to the $314.58 average price target, over the next year the shares will see a 10% growth. (See Tesla stock forecast on TipRanks)

772,Tesla seeks to overturn Louisiana ban on direct car sales,"By Hyunjoo Jin

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has filed a lawsuit to challenge Louisiana's refusal to allow the company to sell vehicles directly to consumers, calling the U.S. state's move protectionist and anti-competitive.

The case is the latest battle to reverse direct sales bans in some states against the electric carmaker, which bypassed traditional car dealerships. In those states, consumers have to travel to neighboring states to secure Tesla vehicles.

Tesla claimed Louisiana officials have violated state and federal antitrust laws by barring direct sales since 2017 and trying to restrict the leasing and servicing of its cars in Louisiana.

""Louisiana consumers' freedom is being unduly restricted by protectionist, anti-competitive and inefficient state regulation,"" according to the lawsuit, which was filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.

Tesla accused Louisiana dealers, dealer association and some members of the Motor Vehicle Commission of entering an ""unlawful conspiracy to bar Tesla from doing business in Louisiana.""

In 2016, Tesla also sued Michigan for the state's direct sales ban and reached a settlement in 2020 under which Tesla can have its cars serviced in Michigan through a subsidiary.

Even though recession fears were mounting until the end of July, investors have not put much stock into the broader market sentiment of late, spurring an ongoing rally in equities. The S&P 500 rose 9.1% in July despite the pressured economic data, the best monthly performance for the index in about two years. Despite investors feeling optimistic, second-quarter GDP declined, which marks ​​two consecutive quarters of deteriorating U.S. growth.

According to Goldman Sachs, household income will grow after Christmas following a year-long decline, and the higher cash flow will continue in the next year. The higher income will reverse about 4.2% of the drop in household discretionary income, supported by higher wages. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, has a similar outlook on consumer spending and believes that retail sales will improve after their battle with inflation in the last year. “Cash flow got hit during 2022 but it’s coming back, and cash flow is what drives spending”, as per Zandi.

Consumer cash flow will increase by 2% in the first quarter of 2023 according to Goldman Sachs’ data, and climb to more than 6% in the second half of 2023, which represents an overall gain of approximately $600 billion. Goldman consumer goods analyst Jason English said in a recent press webinar:

“If we’re cleared by the holidays, we’re in much better shape going forward than the market is currently estimating.”

If consumer spending improves, sectors that are down due to persistent inflation, including materials, construction, and real estate, as well as other discretionary sectors, will continue to improve and recover. Some of the most prominent stocks that can begin to rebound in 2023 include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD).

Multiple recent headwinds for the company ""could flip to tailwinds into 2023 and beyond, possibly ahead of what the market appreciates"", the analyst told investors in a research note.

8. RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42

YTD Share Price Decline as of August 29: 78.19%

(NYSE:RNG) reported Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.45, exceeding market estimates by $0.04. The company’s revenue of $487 million grew by 28.4% year-over-year, and topped Wall Street's consensus by $4.9 million.

MKM Partners analyst Catharine Trebnick assumed coverage of RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) on August 4, issuing a 'Buy' rating and an $80 price target on the stock. The company provides investors ""high-visibility, multi-year stable revenue growth in a large, under-penetrated market"", the analyst told investors. The analyst said a strong competitive advantage and a ""robust"" communications platform positions RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) to gain from the hybrid work-from-anywhere business model.

According to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were long RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) at the end of June 2022, compared to 43 funds in the preceding quarter. Alkeon Capital Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 3.7 million shares worth $193 million.

Here is what the RiverPark Large Growth Fund had to say about RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:

“RingCentral: Despite reporting strong and accelerating revenue growth and profitability throughout the year, RNG shares sold off on concerns of increased competition from Zoom and Microsoft. We believe RingCentral’s partnerships, including with Avaya, Atos, Alcatel, Vodafone, and most recently Mitel provide a sales advantage to help drive 30%+ revenue growth for the next five years. For its 3Q21, RNG reported key metrics above the high-end of its guidance—subscription revenue grew 38%, annual recurring revenue growth accelerated to 42%, total revenue grew 37% and RNG’s 10.5% Non-GAAP Operating margin exceeded guidance by 50 basis points. Management also again raised 2021 subscription revenue growth guidance to 32%.

RingCentral is the largest and fastest growing pure play Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) vendor. Traditionally, business communications have been on-premises hardware-based private branch exchanges (PBX), which primarily support voice-only desktop phones. These systems do not support employees who now communicate from anywhere with any device, using voice, video, text, messaging, and social media. UCaaS encompasses solutions addressing all these needs in a capital and labor light model for customers. RNG is the UCaaS market leader with two million users in an extremely fragmented market and is growing rapidly. The company started in the small-and-medium business market and has migrated to also serving larger enterprises, helped by new channel partnerships. The company’s increasing scale from its growing recurring revenue should improve operating margins, allowing the company to achieve its long-term target of 20%-25%.”

780,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Tesla, Exxon Mobil, Marriott International, Humana and Visa","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – August 30, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla Inc. TSLA, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Marriott International Inc. MAR, Humana Inc. HUM and Visa Inc. V.

Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:

Forget a Meltdown, Each Dip Offers a Solid Entry Point

On Aug 26, Wall Street suffered a bloody blow, ending the summer rally that U.S. stock markets saw from mid-June to mid-August. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 3%, 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, following a stern message from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium.

At this stage, investors should patiently wait and reallocate their portfolios for mid-to-long-term gains instead of immediate profits. Each and every dip provides a solid opportunity to enter the market. With respect to the buy-on-dip strategy, we present five U.S. corporate giants with strong fundamentals and a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies are — Tesla Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp., Marriott International Inc., Humana Inc. and Visa Inc..

Buy on Every Dip as US Fundamentals Remain Solid

Powell reiterated that the central bank would pursue aggressive interest rate hikes and tighter monetary control policies until inflation comes down to at least near its 2% target level. Market participants are expecting more softness in consumer spending and a decline in business spending due to margin squeeze resulting in negative-to-moderate GDP growth. Fed Chairman has also warned of some toughness going forward.

However, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain solid and the recent downtrend in GDP growth was purely Fed-induced. The central bank wants the economy to cool down to some extent to bring back inflation to an acceptable level. So, the U.S. economy should be back on the growth trajectory once monetary policies return to normalcy.

U.S. stock markets are the best destinations for investors. The gigantic size of the U.S. economy has given it a clear upper hand over the European and emerging markets. Furthermore, technological innovation and superiority have always been the pillars of U.S. economic strength.

The U.S. economy also has several future catalysts. On Aug 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed a $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act. The size of the allotted money may rise up to $737 billion in 10 years. The act has provisions of $390 billion to combat climate change. Per the Biden administration, the most important way to restore a clean climate is to encourage Americans to shift toward electric vehicles.

On Aug 10, 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act that will provide $52.7 billion to microprocessor developers for five years. On Nov 15, 2021,  the President had signed a bipartisan infrastructure act of $550 billion in addition to the previously approved funds of $450 billion for five years. The law aims at establishing the United States with the world's best economic infrastructure. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years.

Investment Strategy

At this stage, several stocks look attractive for future growth. However, selecting stocks on the basis of the following three criteria will make the task easy. First, choose U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital > $50 billion) with a well-established business model, globally acclaimed brand recognition and robust financial condition.

Second, look for stocks that have strong growth potential for 2022 and an impressive long-term (estimated 3-5 years) growth rate, which is well above the market's benchmark S&P 500 Index's long-term growth rate of 11.4%.

Third, pick stocks that carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Allocate funds among these stocks and purchase them in parts at every dip to make an effective cost average.

Our Top Picks

Based on the above-mentioned investment strategy, we have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths to buy-on-the-dip to generate handsome profits in the mid-to-long-term.

Tesla is likely to be the largest beneficiary of the U.S. Government's clean climate initiatives. Increasing Model 3 delivery, which forms a significant chunk of Tesla's overall deliveries, is aiding its top line. Along with Model 3, Model Y is contributing to its revenues. The global auto industry is gradually moving toward electric vehicles. TSLA is expected to be the largest beneficiary of this trend.

Tesla has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 58.2% and 65%, respectively, for the current year. Moreover, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 31.2%. The electric vehicle marker posted positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 32.2%.

Exxon Mobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure, which have historically led to industry-leading returns, make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The integrated oil giant expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in its upstream business. By then, XOM expects to reduce flaring and methane emissions by 40%. As the global economy has reopened, crude oil prices are likely to remain high despite near-term growth concerns.

Exxon Mobil has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 50.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.8% over the last 30 days.

XOM has a long-term earnings growth rate of 24.1% and a current dividend yield of 3.6%. The crude oil behemoth recorded positive earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 1.6%.

Marriott International is gaining from the reopening of the international borders and leniency in travel restrictions. Several countries are gradually removing travel restrictions. MAR is consistently expanding its worldwide presence and capitalizing on the demand for hotels in international markets.

Marriott International has an expected revenues and earnings growth rate of 46.1% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 5.1% over the last 30 days.

MAR has a long-term earnings growth rate of 40.1% and a current dividend yield of 0.8%. The hotel giant recorded a positive earnings surprise in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 18.6%.

Visa has been benefiting from expanding business volumes as pandemic-induced restrictions have mostly been withdrawn globally. Investments in technology are solidifying Visa's position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Backed by its strong cash position, V remains committed to boosting its shareholder value.

Visa has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 13.2%, respectively, for next year (ending September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.

V has a long-term earnings growth rate of 16.7% and a current dividend yield of 0.7%. The global technology-driven payment operator recorded a positive earnings surprise in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 8.8%.

Humana's Medicaid business, buoyed by several contract wins and renewals, has been strongly contributing to its top line for years. Buyouts and alliances place HUM well for growth. Humana has been deploying excess capital for several years on balance sheet strength. HUM's solid contributions from the Retail and Healthcare Services units are its major positives.

Humana has an expected revenues and earnings growth rate of 11.9% and 20.4%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings improved 0.7% over the last 30 days.

HUM has a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.4% and a current dividend yield of 0.6%. The leading healthcare plan provider registered positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 9.1%.

783,12 Best Lithium and Battery Stocks To Buy,"In this article, we discuss the 12 best lithium and battery stocks to buy. To skip the detailed analysis of the lithium and battery market, go to 5 Best Lithium and Battery Stocks To Buy.

The demand for lithium has been growing rapidly since the adoption of electric vehicles and grid-scale lithium-ion batteries for energy storage. According to GlobalData, the demand for lithium is expected to surpass 100 thousand tonnes in 2023. Currently, the top three lithium mining countries are Australia, Argentina, and Chile. These three countries produced 87% of the global lithium in 2021.

In 2021, the global lithium market was worth $3.83 billion, which is expected to reach $6.68 billion in 2028 at a CAGR of 8.1%. The main driving factor of lithium demand is the EVs. In December 2021, China’s EV sales reached a record of 502,545 units, representing a YoY growth of 125%. During the same period, BMW delivered 97,000 electric cars, up by 29.6% year on year. Furthermore, due to the high EV demand, S&P expects the global production of lithium to grow by 55% at the end of 2022, compared to the 2020 levels.

Lithium-Ion Battery Market and EVs

The lithium-ion batteries are not only used in electric vehicles but also in consumer electronics, integration of renewable energy with grid technology, telecommunication, and aerospace due to their lightweight, high energy density, and ability to recharge. In 2021,the consumer electronics segment held the highest revenue share of 40%. The lithium-ion battery market size was $36.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $193.13 billion at a CAGR of 23.3% between 2021 and 2028.

Automotive companies are working towards capturing a higher market share in the electric vehicle market. In 2021, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) accounted for 79% of all the EVs registered in the U.S. and still holds around 70% of the total market share. It is followed by Nissan at a meagre 8.51%. Furthermore, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) expects to spend $5 billion on electric vehicles in 2022 and is looking to inject another $50 billion CAPEX through 2026. The company expects a CAGR of 90% for its EV models. Other legacy automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen, and Toyota have also announced plans to take a bite out of the electric vehicle market share.

Inflation Reduction Act

Around mid-August, the US senate voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes funding of $400 billion over a decade for climate and energy-related programs. Out of the $400 billion, $369 billion will go towards domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles, clean energy technologies, and making buildings energy efficient. For EVs, the act includes a $7,500 tax credit at POS for new vehicles and $4000 for used ones. The tax credit will be applied to electric and hybrid vehicles manufactured in North America, which meet the minimum battery capacity requirements of 5 kilowatt-hours.

786,Elon Musk sends letter to terminate Twitter deal after whistleblower report,"Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan joins the Live show to discuss the latest surrounding the Elon Musk vs. Twitter lawsuit.

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: We are also watching Musk here on the day two.

BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. Elon Musk's legal team has sent a fresh letter to Twitter to scrap the billionaire's acquisition of the company in light of a whistleblower's recent complaints. Yahoo Finance legal correspondent Alexis Keenan is here with the details. Alexis.

ALEXIS KEENAN: Hey, Brian. Yeah, this is a letter that Musk's attorneys have sent, and it's filed in the SEC filings here. So that's where we're seeing it. And this is really additional justification for terminating the $44 billion merger between the two parties.

It's really more ammunition to that original letter that Musk's attorneys had sent to Twitter, terminating back on July 8. Now, this new letter, it's based largely on the publication of that whistleblower report that came from Twitter's former chief. The head of security Peiter Zatko, he filed that with US authorities, accusing Twitter of both lax security measures and also its executives of purposefully evading knowledge of its spam and bot numbers.

Now, this new letter says that Twitter is in breach of the merger agreement on six different parts. It goes after the company's representations at the time that the parties entered the contract. So let's take a look at what those six things are, according to Musk's lawyers.

They claim that Twitter in 2011, that FTC consent decree that it entered into over protecting user data, that they're in breach of that agreement, according to Zatko's claims. So they say that that violates part of the contract that's about representations that Twitter's in compliance with all applicable laws. Next, they say that-- claims that the company gave false and misleading information about security.

So again, pointing at Twitter's level of security measures that it's running day to day on the platform. They say that that breaches its representation, that it did not have any security problems in its financial statements. Also, saying that Twitter's CEO gave false and misleading reports to the board in order to cover up what they say are flagrant vulnerabilities in Twitter's security and data protection protocols.

Story continues

That goes to part of the contract that Twitter represents it has no knowledge of fraud that involves anyone in the management levels. Also, some additional claims there by Musk's lawyers saying that the company failed to disclose what it should have seen as legal risks, representing in the contract that there was no threatened or pending lawsuits that the company was facing, and also, that it wouldn't face any government investigations that it knew of at the time.

And finally, their apparent lack of a license for Twitter's core machine learning. We're still trying to find out more about what that claim is exactly, but Musk seeming to think that there's an IP violation that also violates the merger agreement. All in all, they say these things could add up to not only breaches of certain representations that Twitter made in the contract but also could amount to a material adverse event effect that could impact Twitter and give Musk the right to terminate this contract.

But, guys, just-- this is more ammunition. Musk's lawyers point out that the parties believe that their original claims still stand, but this is just in addition to those claims. So Musk here coming out in full force and using that Zatko complaint to back it up.

BRAD SMITH: Where are we at within the broader proceedings for the courts and where they're going to actually allow this into evidence? And where within those proceedings would Musk's lawyers continue to kind of make their case and ultimately get some type of decision?

ALEXIS KEENAN: Right. So right now, we're square in the middle of the discovery process, and that's the part where the two parties-- Twitter and Musk-- they exchange information. And they're fighting a lot about that. They fought about it last week. And in fact, just yesterday, along with this letter, there are also filings with the court where Musk's lawyers are saying, even though Twitter was required to turn over a certain information about its spam and bot data, that they're not getting what they want.

And so there's a lot of back and forth with the parties about how much Twitter actually has to hand over. They're fighting hard. There are additional filings as of yesterday. Whether those will go to oral arguments like they did last time around, we'll have to see.

But this trial is close approaching at the end of October, so there is a lot to do before then.

BRAD SMITH: Alexis, thanks so much for breaking this all down, continuing to keep us up to speed on all of the proceedings here with this case. Appreciate it.",2022-08-30T13:43:09+00:00,2022-08-30

788,"Biden seeks Taiwan arms sale, PlayStation establishes mobile gaming unit, Tesla violated labor law","Notable business headlines include reports that the Biden Administration is seeking approval for a $1.1 billion arms sale to Taiwan, Sony establishes PlayStation mobile gaming division, and Tesla violating a labor law.

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: The Biden administration reportedly seeking approval from US Congress on an estimated $1.1 billion arms sale to Taiwan. The package would include roughly 100 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and roughly 60 additional antiship harpoon missiles as well as a surveillance radar contract extension. This coming amid heightened tensions with China after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan earlier this month despite China's opposition.

Japanese gaming giant Sony launched a new PlayStation Studios mobile division in an effort to expand from its console business into the mobile gaming space, with Sony's latest acquisition Savage Game joining the fold. Now, this comes after a rocky second quarter for Sony's gaming division, downgrading its full-year profit forecast for the business, as well as the boom resulting from the pandemic-- as that begins to fade-- while supply chain challenges-- they're persisting right now.

And in a ruling by the National Labor Relations Board, Tesla violated labor law by restricting employees from wearing pro-union shirts. The NLRB mandating that Tesla cease and desist from maintaining and enforcing the overly broad ""team-wear"" policy that prohibits production associates from wearing black union shirts. Tesla also being required to notify current employees that its ""team-wear"" policy has been rescinded or revised and provide a copy of any revised policy.",2022-08-30T14:37:23+00:00,2022-08-30
789,Tesla (TSLA) is a Screaming Buy Post 3:1 Stock Spilt,"Electric vehicle (EV) behemoth, Tesla TSLA recently completed a 3-for-1 stock split, making its shares more attractive to retail investors. Is the stock worth a buy now post the split at its current price levels of around $280 a piece?

Stock Split Back in Fashion

When Tesla last split its stock in August 2020, shares skyrocketed, thanks to an influx of new buyers and increased liquidity. Shares have been on a massive run since then, with the company joining the elite $1-trillion club in October 2021. The stock had become quite expensive for investors who were a little tighter on the budget, grinding down the overall trading volume and driving away potential investors. Noting the steep price tag of Tesla shares, the company again decided to split its stock, making its shares more affordable. In June 2022, TSLA announced that its board approved a three-for-one stock split, subject to shareholder approval at the company’s annual meeting on Aug 4.

Stock splits have actually gained massive traction over the past few years. It’s one of the more positive announcements that shareholders can receive. Besides Tesla, we’ve witnessed several market titans undergo a stock split so far in 2022, including Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.

Amazon announced its 20-for-1 split back in early March, representing the company’s first split since 1999. Needless to say, it shocked the market. The split went into effect a few months later, on Jun 6.Back in February, Alphabet announced its plans to split its stock 20-for-1. Like AMZN, buyers came out in full force for GOOGL shares. Alphabet shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis on Jul 18.

Of course, a stock split doesn’t affect a company’s market capitalization. However, it lowers the price of each share, providing ease for the stock price to multiply once again and offering investors with sizable gains.

Coming back to Tesla, we believe that the company has a host of potential catalysts surrounding it, which makes it an attractive buy now.

Key Growth Drivers

Over the years, EV maker Tesla has evolved into a dynamic technology innovator. It is the market leader in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States, with roughly 70% market share. The company’s flagship Model 3 is the best-selling EV model in the United States. Model Y has also gained immense popularity.

The automaker is riding on the robust demand for Models 3 and Y, which form a major chunk of its total deliveries. Deliveries of Model 3/Y witnessed a CAGR of more than 74% between 2019 and 2021. Musk remains optimistic about meeting the average annual deliveries growth target of 50% over a multi-year horizon. Production ramp-up at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck from next year, are set to support deliveries growth.

High volumes are aiding Tesla in achieving cost and production efficiencies, thereby strengthening margins. While the temporary decline in Shanghai production volume resulted in a sequential fall in gross margins in the last reported quarter, the metric is likely to show improvement in the second half of 2022.

Tesla posted the sixth straight earnings beat in the last reported quarter. Even in the face of harsh business conditions, the company’s top and bottom lines in the second quarter grew 41.6% and 56.5%, respectively.

The company has had zero issues with generating serious revenue growth. Since 2016, Tesla’s annual revenue has soared 668%. TSLA has managed to grow its annual revenues by double-digit percentages each year since 2012. Thanks to strong deliveries and a rise in the average selling price of vehicles, we believe Tesla would maintain its upward trajectory in automotive revenues.

Tesla’s energy generation and storage revenues are also growing, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products. The efforts to strengthen its balance sheet are also praiseworthy.  Simply put, Tesla seems to be firing on all cylinders.

For the current fiscal year (FY22), the EV titan is projected to generate $85 billion in revenues, implying a double-digit uptick of nearly 58% year over year. In FY23, the top line is forecast to rise by an additional 41%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FY22 earnings per share is pegged at $3.73, suggesting year-over-year growth of 65%. The bottom line is projected to increase another additional 35.5% in FY23.

Final Thoughts

While Tesla continues to look grossly overvalued, its share price has anyway long been divorced from the company’s fundamentals. As an auto manufacturer delivering roughly a million cars per year, it would need to increase production by 16 times to reach fair value. But then again, Tesla is not just any other auto manufacturer but also a battery/software developer, a solar tech company and an innovation powerhouse. In fact, TSLA is often labeled by many as a tech company.

Tesla’s innovative engine, brand value and growth prospects are way better than other companies in the same space. So even as the EV market gathers momentum with competition heating up, Tesla looks set to remain a leading player.

So, with its shares being well below its all-time highs post stock split, TSLA is worth scooping up now for long-term gains. For investors who can swallow elevated valuation levels and are looking for companies with robust growth prospects, Tesla should be on the top of their list.

791,7 Hot Tech Stocks to Buy in September,"If you’re looking for tech stocks to buy, it might help to look to the market for emerging trends.

A recent note to clients by investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) highlighted the fact that hedge funds are once again buying U.S. technology stocks. In fact, during this year’s second quarter, hedge funds increased their investments in U.S. tech stocks to their highest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Hedge funds grew their tech stocks to buy while reducing their investments in energy securities during the April through June period. At the same time, the turnover rate of technology stocks among hedge funds fell to a record low of 23% during the second quarter.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

According to Goldman Sachs’ note, hedge fund managers began moving money back into technology stocks in mid-June on signs that inflation may have peaked in the U.S.

These tech stocks to buy include familiar names such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), to name only a few. Clearly, the so-called “smart money” is betting on a rotation back into technology stocks as inflation cools and the prospect of fewer interest rate hikes nears.

With technology stocks back on the radar of professional money managers, we offer up seven hot tech stocks to buy for investors to buy in September.

AAPL Apple $158.76 AMD Advanced Micro Devices $84.19 MSFT Microsoft $262.96 TMUS T-Mobile $144.59 AVGO Broadcom $497.93 GOOGL Alphabet $110.09 CRM Salesforce $156.36

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of the top tech stocks to buy among hedge funds at the start of the summer. September is the perfect time for retail investors to also buy AAPL stock given that it represents the kick-off of the company’s new products leading into the year-end holiday shopping season.

On Sept. 7, Apple is scheduled to host its annual product launch event where it is expected to unveil the iPhone 14 and several other electronic devices that analysts say are likely to include new MacBook computers, low-end iPads and several new versions of the Apple Watch.

Story continues

Apple plans to live stream the launch rather than hold an in-person event, continuing a trend it began during the pandemic. Media reports say that the standard iPhone 14 will look nearly identical to the iPhone 13.

The minor difference is the company will eliminate the 5.4-inch “mini” version of the smartphone and add a model with a 6.7-inch screen, the first time Apple has included a display of that size.

For the iPhone 14 Pro, Apple is reportedly planning to replace the front-facing camera cut out with a pill-shaped hole for Face identification, and add a faster processor chip and a 48-megapixel wide-angle camera.

The launch events each September typically kick Apple’s sales into high gear heading into the fourth and final quarter of the year, and its stock often gets a boost as well.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has introduced a new Ryzen 7000 desktop processor that it claims can boost personal computer (PC) speeds by 29%. The new processors go on sale Sept. 27 and are the first new PC chips from AMD since 2020.

AMD says its powerful new Ryzen 7000 chips will help improve processing speeds for video games, video editing software applications, and graphic design programs.

Additionally, the Ryzen 7000 processor is anticipated to reduce energy consumption by 62% compared to the Ryzen 5000 chips. The new 7000 series chips use a newer five-nanometer technology that’s faster and more energy efficient, helping to push the top speed of the processors to 5.7GHz.

AMD is also leading in the use of the so-called “chiplet” design approach that packages several smaller processing elements into one large chip. Year-to-date, AMD’s stock is down 42%. While the decline might be eye-popping at first glance, investors should view it as a buy-the-dip opportunity.

Microsoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the second most purchased tech stock among hedge funds in this year’s second quarter, behind only Amazon.

This should not come as a surprise given that Microsoft remains a blue-chip technology security.

The company continues to post strong earnings amid an increasingly diversified business, maintains a market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion. It is one of the few mega-cap tech stocks that pays a dividend (current yield: 0.94%). Plus, Microsoft’s current price-to-earnings ratio of 27 makes the stock look reasonably priced at its current level of $263.08 a share.

Despite the market turmoil this year and challenges ranging from supply chain constraints to high inflation, Microsoft continues to diversify and grow its various businesses — from its $68 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) to its Azure cloud computing segment.

Its most recent quarterly results showed that revenues for the Azure cloud unit grew 40% from a year earlier, which was faster than any of its competitors’ cloud computing divisions. Any way you look at it, Microsoft keeps firing on all cylinders.

Wireless internet provider T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is the rare technology stock that is outperforming the broader market and is actually up on the year.

Since the first trading day this past January, TMUS stock has risen 26%. The share price appreciation comes as T-Mobile aggressively rolls out its fifth generation (5G) wireless networks across the U.S.

The company counted more than 110 million subscribers in the U.S. at the end of June this year, making it the second-largest wireless carrier in the country after Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which has 143 million wireless customers.

T-Mobile recently generated headlines around the world with its announcement that it is partnering with Elon Musk’s privately-held company SpaceX. The plan is to connect its 5G smartphones to satellite internet and eliminate mobile dead zones throughout the continental U.S.

Called the “Coverage Above and Beyond” plan, T-Mobile says its latest generation of smartphones will connect to satellites operated by SpaceX and provide connections of at least two to four Megabits per second across any coverage area in the U.S., including Hawaii, Alaska, and in territorial waters.

The company says customers will be able to text and send MMS messages anywhere there is a clear view of the sky.

Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is essentially flat, but the share price has doubled in the last five years. Another reason for investors to like Broadcom is its 3.25% dividend yield, which is among the best quarterly payouts of any tech stock.

Broadcom first paid investors a quarterly dividend of $0.07 a share back in 2010. Since then, the company has grown its dividend payout 20% annually to its current level of $4.09 per share each quarter.

Broadcom has managed to grow its earnings this year despite facing numerous headwinds, and the company isn’t letting the current downturn stop it from growing.

At the end of May, Broadcom announced that it is acquiring enterprise software companyVMware (NYSE:VMW) for $61 billion in cash and stock. VMware will help Broadcom diversify and further expand into the lucrative cloud computing arena.

The VMware deal follows a string of acquisitions by Broadcom, which has also included the purchase of CA Technologies in 2018 for $18.9 billion and the buying of Symantec in 2019 for $10.7 billion.

Alphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.

Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock has rarely been as affordable and cheap as it is following its 20-for-1 stock split in July.

Following the split, and with continued downward pressure, GOOGL stock is currently trading at $108.49 per share.

With a P/E ratio of 20, Alphabet looks like a solid long-term bet for investors interested in picking up best-of-breed technology stocks. Year-to-date, Alphabet stock has declined 25% and it may get cheaper yet if September proves once again that it is the worst month for the stock market.

Investors who have a long time horizon may find they are richly rewarded in the coming years from picking up Alphabet stock at current lows.

Alphabet is much more today than the Google search engine. The company has its hands in everything from artificial intelligence and cloud computing to self-driving cars and wearable tech. It’s latest push is in cybersecurity, having recently acquired two companies in the space: Mandiant and Siemplify.

Alphabet appears keen to move into the cloud security space where Microsoft is currently a dominant force. Alphabet has said it plans to integrate its new cybersecurity products and services into its Google Cloud Platform moving forward. The cybersecurity push is another example of how Alphabet is always looking to the future.

Salesforce (CRM) A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce sticker.

On paper, cloud computing giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) looks like a no-brainer when it comes to the best tech stocks to buy now.

The company just reported earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines, announced a $10 billion share repurchase program (the first in the company’s history), and it has successfully completed its $27 billion acquisition of messaging app Slack.

Yet, CRM stock is down 38%. The latest slump in the share price came after the company issued weak forward guidance alongside its most recent earnings.

Specifically, Salesforce forecast adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.21 a share on $7.82 billion to $7.83 billion in revenue for the current third quarter of 2022.

That fell short of the $1.29 in adjusted earnings per share on $8.07 billion in revenue that Wall Street had penciled in for the San Francisco-based company. The disappointing guidance completely overshadowed what was otherwise a stellar print from Salesforce.

For the second quarter, the company announced earnings of $1.19 a share compared to $1.02 that had been expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv. Revenues came in at $7.72 billion versus $7.69 billion that was expected on the Street. Strike while the stock price is low.

793,"Tesla watch: Louisiana lawsuit, proposed 'phantom braking' class action, labor board loss","After an initial boost from a three-for-one stock split last Wednesday, Tesla stock has been under pressure.

With shares of the electric vehicle maker down more than 2% as of the market close on Tuesday, here are three big stories moving Tesla stock (TSLA):

Tesla takes on Louisiana’s dealership laws

Tesla is suing several parties in federal court over Louisiana's ban on the direct selling of vehicles to customers, the Wall Street Journal reported. Louisiana is now one of 10 states in the country that requires automakers to sell their cars through independent dealerships.

In the suit filed last week, Tesla went after the Louisiana Automobile Dealers Association, Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission officials, and some dealerships in the state claiming the defendants conspired to put the state's new law in place and restrict sales and customer choice.

Currently, prospective customers in Louisiana must go out of state to buy Tesla vehicles. Furthermore, Tesla claims the defendants prevented Tesla from leasing cars and servicing Tesla vehicles registered in the state of Louisiana.

The Journal notes that Tesla has challenged laws like this in the past, notably in Michigan, where it settled with the state to allow the direct sales of cars to residents. If Tesla is successful in this lawsuit, the company may use this as another test case to challenge other state bans on direct sales.

Tesla sued over ‘phantom braking’

Tesla is on the other side of the docket in the state of California where a Model 3 owner is suing the company over a “phantom braking” defect.

Reuters reported that the plaintiff claimed his Model 3 suddenly stops for no apparent reason, which he called a ""frightening and dangerous nightmare"" in the complaint. The plaintiff is seeking class-action status for the lawsuit, claiming that Tesla rushed its Autopilot and Full Self Driving software to customers across the country, rendering it unsafe. Missouri, United States - March 14, 2022: Close-up of a Tesla Model S plaid, driving down a highway on autopilot. And a man sitting with his hands on his legs. (Associated Press)

The lawsuit accuses Tesla of “fraudulently hiding the safety risks associated with Autopilot, breaching its warranties, unfairly profiting from Autopilot and violating California's unfair competition law,” according to Reuters.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is currently investigating several Tesla Autopilot crashes concerning accidents with parked emergency vehicles.

NLRB rules Tesla violated labor laws

On Monday, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that Tesla violated labor laws by forbidding workers to wear pro-union shirts.

Tesla requires workers at the factory to wear black shirts emblazoned with the Tesla logo. Tesla has argued the dress code is meant to prevent workplace hazards and damage to cars.

According to the ruling, a former Tesla worker claimed that a manager told him to remove his T-shirt supporting the United Auto Workers (UAW), despite the fact other workers were wearing shirts with sports team logos. Workers assemble cars on the line at the Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California (Getty Images)

Tesla factories are not unionized and CEO Elon Musk has been critical of unions in the past.

“Wearing union insignia, whether a button or a t-shirt, is a critical form of protected communication,” the ruling said, adding that “for many decades, employees have used insignia to advocate for their workplace interests — from supporting organizing campaigns, to protesting unfair conditions in the workplace — and the law has always protected them.""

This June, ARK Investment Management's CEO Cathie Wood, on CNBC's Squawk Box, commented that the American economy is in a downturn that she had initially underestimated. The lasting inflation in the economy is something that has plunged the US into a state of recession caused by supply chain disruptions alongside geopolitical risks. The unforeseeable Russian invasion of Ukraine has only worsened the problem, according to Wood, setting the US up for deflation.

While the grave state of the economy has been tough on Wood's flagship fund, according to the ARK CEO herself, her clients have continued supporting her. Investors continue to seek diversification in an economic downturn, leading to over $180 million being poured into the ARK Innovation ETF in June alone. Wood believed that disruptive innovation is the key to solving the economic problem.

Holding stakes in major companies such as Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Wood has managed to weather the storm. In July, the ARK Innovation Fund was on track to post its first monthly gain in eight months, according to Reuters. The fund was up 11.3% that month, helped in part by Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) 27% gain and Coinbase Global, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:COIN) 35% gain that month.  12 Best ARK Stocks To Buy Now

Wedbush Securities named three top tech stock picks this August, for the remainder of the year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was among the selected stocks. Analyst Ives believes the company's Azure cloud computing platform will stay strong in fiscal 2023 as well, and that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will benefit as a result.

Ken Fisher's stake in the company was made up of 28.7 million shares worth $7.4 billion. The total stake value of all hedge funds holding stakes in the company was over $56 billion.

Investment management company Ave Maria mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:

“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s cloud business is nearly half of the company’s revenue and the largest business in Microsoft, with Office 365 being the second largest. The cloud business helps customers save money, so it is somewhat recession-proof. Office 365 allows customers to purchase low annual subscriptions, as opposed to purchasing expensive license agreements every few years. This could keep the revenue stable in a tough economic environment. We believe the company will be able to maintain mid-teen revenue growth for the foreseeable future.”

11. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)

ARK Investment’s Stake Value: $8,631,000

Percentage of ARK Investment’s 13F Portfolio: 0.05%

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 252

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another Big Tech company. It focuses on the retail sale of consumer products in the US and globally.

Vulcan Value Partners, an investment management firm, mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what it said:

“Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has three components to its business model: online retail, cloud-based Amazon Web Services (AWS), and online advertising. We believe that the stock price has declined primarily due to its disappointing online retail results. Retail was extremely successful during COVID, and Amazon spent immensely to protect the consumer experience including buying extra inventory, buying inventory ahead of time, securing alternate shipping routes and adding extra warehouse space.

We believe this long-term behavior has been successful for Amazon as customer retention and engagement remain at high levels. Post-COVID, the company is in the process of rightsizing its cost structure, and it is facing a tough period of comparisons. The retail segment is the smallest contributor to our overall value. The majority of the company’s value is in AWS, which we believe is one of the best businesses in the world. AWS’ revenue is expected to be approximately $80 billion this year, which is nearly double the amount in 2020.

The company’s online advertising has turned into an attractive business that did not exist 15 years ago, and we estimate its revenue to be around $40 billion this year.”

10. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)

Out of 895 hedge funds tracked in the second quarter, 153 hedge funds were long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), with a total stake value of $22.3 billion. In comparison, 160 hedge funds were long the stock in the previous quarter, with a total stake value of $29.7 billion.

Investment management company Arch Capital mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:

“In May we decided to buy Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (parent company of Google, YouTube, and Android). Our thesis was simple. Alphabet has billions of locked-in users around the globe with businesses like Search, Maps, and YouTube that should grow in-line or faster than worldwide GDP. With all the cash these businesses generate, management is able to reinvest in Google Cloud, Other Bets projects like Waymo, and return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. At an enterprise value-to-free cash flow (EV/FCF) of around 20 at the time of our purchase, we believe this sets up shareholders for low risk 15%+ returns over the next five years.”

796,Elon Musk letter cites additional reasons to break Twitter deal,"Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Keenan breaks down the latest details in the ongoing lawsuit between Elon Musk and Twitter.

Video Transcript

DAVE BRIGGS: Lawyers for Elon Musk have sent a new letter calling off the billionaire's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance legal correspondent Alexis Keenan for the latest here.

Hi there, Alexis. What are we learning?

ALEXIS KEENAN: OK, a lot going on here in this case, and that's to be expected because this is a very fast-moving case in Delaware Chancery Court. Now, Musk's attorneys, in this letter that was sent to Twitter's lawyer, their chief legal counsel, yesterday-- we're just seeing it today-- it's saying that there's additional justification for Musk to walk away from that $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter in a merger.

Now, the original letter was sent for termination on July 8. These are just additional reasons that his lawyers are making. In that first letter, Musk had argued that Twitter breached the merger agreement by not sharing data related to fake accounts on the platform and also misrepresented those accounts as to its monetizable daily active users.

This new letter is based specifically though on a whistleblower report from Peter Zatko, who was Twitter's former chief security advisor. He was let go from the company back in January, and he's filed this whistleblower report with the FTC, the DOJ, as well as the SEC. Now, Musk says that if the report from Zatko is true that Twitter has breached five additional parts of the merger agreement, specifically in its representations that it made in the contract but also to filings in-- its regulatory filings to the SEC.

Now, most of these arguments, these new ones that are made there, are uphill battles for Musk because they do rest on the judge in Delaware agreeing that it would cause Twitter a material adverse effect that is a really significant change to its business operations. It's just a very high bar to try to prove.

Story continues

There is one more fraud claim in there though where Musk is saying that Twitter represented in its regulatory filings that it was free of false or misleading statements. So that's the one where he might be able to hang his hat on but not so much more in this particular letter.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, this really is a fast-moving case that we're seeing here. And, meanwhile, of course, a number of advisory firms are urging shareholders to vote for the deal. So what can you tell us about that?

ALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, there's a couple major shareholder advisory firms. One is Institutional Shareholder Services, and one is Glass Lewis. Both issued reports today in support of this takeover by Musk, saying that shareholders should go ahead and vote for this. They said, particularly from ISS, that Musk's all-cash offer really equals liquidity plus certainty of value. So they're backing it there. They say it's best to focus on that, the particular fundamentals of the deal, not the ongoing litigation between the parties, saying that, look, there's still a good chance that Musk is going to have to go through with this deal.

But, also, guys, there are a couple more things that Musk has filed today. He's looking to delay the trial about a month. He's looking for a date after November 10. Originally, this case is-- and it's still set for trial on October 17. He said he needs more time to investigate those whistleblower claims.

So a lot of fast-moving parts here. And we'll try to keep all of them brought to you. That's what we've got going on right now.

SEANA SMITH: You certainly are going to be very busy. All right, Alexis, thanks so much.",2022-08-30T19:28:34+00:00,2022-08-30
797,"Tech stocks: MATANA is the new FAANG, analyst says","Constellation Research Principal Analyst & Founder Ray Wang joins Yahoo Finance Live to make the case for why MATANA should be the new name for Big Tech stocks instead of FAANG.

Video Transcript

- The popular acronym FANG may be a thing of the past. Our next guest says that investors need to focus on a new group of tech giants instead. He calls it MATANA? MATONA? You're going to tell me how to pronounce it here in just a second, but Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Amazon. Joining us now we have Ray Wang. He's joining us here on set, Constellation Research Principal Analyst and Founder. Ray, it's great to see you here in person finally, so Microsoft, Tesla, Nvidia, the new editions. Meta and Netflix are out. Why?

RAY WANG: They're out because they're one trick ponies. And in the digital world, what happens if you're not doing other business models and digital monetization, it's not going to survive. And we've been seeing that with Netflix. They've got to get into ads. They've got to get into ads. They haven't yet, right? And they're taking a beating from it right. Facebook has got to do something besides ads. Once again, they're taking a beating for it. So is it going to be the glasses? It's going to be the metaverse? We're not there yet. And that's really kind of what the challenge is.

But you take something like Apple, and what have they done? They've got ads. They've got surge. They've got goods. They've got services, memberships and subscriptions all down the line. Amazon is doing the same thing as well. And they're doing well. And then if you look at something like Tesla, they've been doing well. I mean, let's take a look at the 52 week lows, right? Those three companies are outperforming the rest of the tech sector, something by 20-- they're 20% to 30% above their 52-week lows, even in this route that's going on right now.

- Another addition, Microsoft. Why?

RAY WANG: Microsoft has more than just business-to-business and consumer. They've been able to manage both. They're positioned well for the metaverse. They're position well for the cloud. And of course, they've got their gaming business.

Story continues

- Ray, what about Nvidia? We want to bring that up because that is a stock that has struggled a little bit as of late. We talk about the challenges facing the sector. You're bullish on that name. Citi was out this morning, saying it's still going to be a challenging couple of months for this sector. Why is Nvidia the right pick for you?

RAY WANG: So NVIDIA is a lot more than just the chips that we look at and just more than the data center or the gaming. They're sitting at the edge between AI, the metaverse, the future of compute. And the way they do their partnerships is they're set up in a way that the GPU is going to be dominant for quite some time, plus all the other high performance computing aspects. And so while supply chains are kind of holding them up at the moment, they're going to come back. And if you want to buy them at a cheap level now, like, a year from now, you won't be regretting that at all.

- I just want to close the loop on a Netflix. Why are they out?

RAY WANG: Well, the reason they're out is because how many more subscribers? How many more subscriptions are you going to handle?

- It doesn't seem like it's a game anymore. Like they've moved on the evaluation. So once we get past that, still you're not in on Netflix.

RAY WANG: Do you want ads on Netflix yet? That's the question. But you know what they really should do, and if Reed's listening, product placement should be where they, plus the ability to do IP licensing. Look how Disney makes its money. We should have the ""Game of Thrones"" theme park. Actually, no, I don't want that. But you get the idea.

- HBO Max, yeah, yeah.

- Well, you bring up an interesting point, because when we look at the tech sector, certainly we have seen it under a tremendous amount of pressure this year, just overall. Even Bank of America, their recent fund flows showing that $2 billion net was taken out of tech stocks funds just last week. When do you think we're going to see the tide start to shift there? Because at the same time, we're still having the Fed saying that they're not going to be done raising rates any time soon.

RAY WANG: You're completely right. I mean, what's been going on at the macro level is interest rates, we don't know where they're going to end. And if you came out of Jackson Hole thinking, OK, we'll have interest rates at probably we'll see around 4 and 5 is kind of where we'll end up. That's OK. But the problem is the Fed is trying to address core inflation.

The problem is not core inflation. It's headline inflation. Headline inflation is energy and food. And if we don't get energy prices down, we really have no control, and everything's spiraling. You can do all you want on core inflation, fine. You might be able to chip off 1% or 2% there. But wages are still going up. If you look at employment, we're where we were in 2019, in terms of number of jobs available and number of people, especially in tech. There's three jobs for every individual-- no, there's two jobs for every individual in tech. And so we've got huge issues.

So and if we spread this out, like 10 years out, it's going to get even more interesting because the world population is going to peak at about 9.1 billion. And it's going to go down from there. So we're really short. So automation is going to have to make up the rest. And that's where a lot of this, where we look for tech, is really automation is going to be one of the big future areas.

- So earlier you spoke to Reed about what Netflix had to do. How about speak to Jerome, Jerome Powell, about what the Fed ought to do, and can they land this plane?

RAY WANG: There's only so much they can do. You can glide path in. But the rest is policy. It's got to come from the presidential level.

- Ray, what about Apple, one of your picks here, one of the consistent picks that I think you have liked now for quite some time. They're coming out with a new phone expected to release September 7, the big event. How much of a game changer do you think it's going to be significant here for Apple, at least over the coming quarters?

RAY WANG: So we're always like, hey, are you going to buy the next iPhone? And people are on every other year cycle, some people on every three year cycles. But that number is so big. This is a super cycle in general, in terms of people refreshing their phones. So there's probably 200 to 300 million people that are still going to refresh this phone cycle.

And 5G is part of it. The new camera is part of it. And then, of course, what else is going to happen? And that's what they're going to announce. But the thing about Apple is not the fact that they're selling more phones, it's the fact that they're selling more services on every phone. And so all the services, right now it's something about 21% of revenues is on services. They're going to get to about 25% in the next 24 months. So these are just devices to sell more services. And the RPU is huge.

- Just a vessel. And you talk about the trend that we've learned from tech earnings, which is when it comes to digital ads, what have we learned in that space?

RAY WANG: We've learned that social sucks. Social doesn't hold it anymore. And what we were looking for is commerce. That's where the ads are, and search still wins. So search and commerce are where you see that. But think about this market. It's kind of crazy. The three dominant players are in three different business models. Google is in search. Facebook and Meta is in social, and Amazon, the third player, sitting somewhere close to $40 billion is in commerce. So they're duking it out for digital ads. But I can tell you, commerce and search are the ones that are winning.

- All right, what about cybersecurity? We haven't talked much about that, certainly a huge growth potential here in the tech space. Any names in particular that you like there?

RAY WANG: I still like Crowdstrike. I still like Palo Alto. I think they're pretty solid. Those are the ones that are going to carry for quite some time.

- Ray Wang, next time you just need to hang out for the whole hour.

- I know.

- We will not kick you out. Good to have you in the studio, sir.

RAY WANG: It's been a long time.

- It has.

- I appreciate it. Excellent stuff.",2022-08-30T19:52:12+00:00,2022-08-30
798,Tesla lawsuit challenges Louisiana ban on selling cars directly to consumers,"Yahoo Finance reporter Pras Subramanian details how Tesla is suing for the right to sell cars directly to consumers in the state of Louisiana, which outlaws it, and how companies Lucid and Nikola have filed to raise funds via stock offerings.

Video Transcript

[AUDIO LOGO]

- Tesla filing a lawsuit challenging a Louisiana law that restricts its ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers. Yahoo Finance senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian here with the details. Pras, long been a question between dealers and states and Tesla. This has long been in the making.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, it's been an issue with Tesla for many years. They've always wanted to sell directly. You go to their showroom, or even now on their app, but many states want-- 10 of them, to just ban that practice outright. They wanted you to go through independent dealers. These are really old laws about how protecting consumers and sort of--

- The dealers, right?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. Yeah.

- The dealer lobby.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Exactly. Oh yeah, big lobby.

- Very powerful

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: In fact, Tesla is suing a dealer association-- a couple of dealers, some officials with the DMV in Louisiana-- to change that law. They say that it's anti-competitive, it doesn't give consumers choice in the matter. So Tesla is trying to use that as another test case. So if they can win here, they'll take it to places like Texas, and maybe New Mexico or places where they can actually try to challenge these direct bans to car sales.

SEANA SMITH: It certainly will be interesting to see what happens in this space because, like you said, it pertains to many more states, not just Louisiana. Pras, while we have here, we want to stick with the EV space. There's also a bit of news, Lucid and Nikola both making moves here to raise cash. What can you tell us? Because we know it's a very, very competitive landscape. They need more money.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, you know Lucid filing a shelf registration for $8 billion in common stock, preferred-- even debt, Nikola for $400 million to kind of raise new funding. Basically, they're just trying to-- at this point in the stage of their companies, they're trying to get more runway as they burn so much cash.

You know, Lucid burned $2 billion last quarter. They have about $4.5 left in cash and cash reserves. So you can imagine by middle next year, they're almost out of cash. So they filed to have flexibility for in the future what could be a turn in the economy. Component prices going up, stuff like that, so they want to kind of have a flexibility.

And remember, Nikola-- former CEO, Trevor Milton, tried to block that at the meeting, and he actually lost, so they were able to get that through. So they'll have the flexibility in the coming years, hopefully, for them.",2022-08-30T20:03:27+00:00,2022-08-30

Video Transcript

[AUDIO LOGO]

RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, we're just a few minutes away from the closing bell. As you can see, all three major indices still under pressure. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre to break down the market action. Hi, Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: Hey there. Well, let's take a look at the YFi Interactive. And we can see everything's down by about 1% or more. We've seen a lot of these days recently.

Let's take a look at the sector action. And in fact, we're going to take a look at a couple of heatmaps here. This is the energy sector. So we saw crude oil off about over $5.00 today. That would be WTI settling down in the lower part of that $90 per barrel range.

But I do want to get to some of the sector action. Now, there you can see in the lower right, that is energy followed by materials. Materials down 1.7%. And then you have real estate and then utilities, industrials, and consumer discretionary. All of those are on the bottom line. Now, on the top left, the best performing sector is still underwater by 45 basis points. That would be financials.

And let's take a look at the NASDAQ 100, where we can see some of the damage done to some of the mega caps. Tesla and Nvidia, those are each down about 2%. AstraZeneca up here in the upper part, that's down about three 3 and 3/4 of 1%.

And just taking a look at some of our leaders here. Only LQD, that it was that is a US government bond ETF, that is up about 15 basis points. But to the downside, we are seeing a continuation of a lot of these sectors and leaders that have been leading to the downside all year long.

MJ, that is the cannabis ETF, that is down about 5% followed by KWEB. That is the Chinese internet ETF that is down by 3%. Then you have the Dow Transports, Momentum, then the SOX, that is the chip stocks, and then solar energy. All of these are underperforming.

So let's take a look inside some of these sectors we've been talking about. First up, is disruption. Here we can see the Ark components. Guess what? Some of these not doing too bad today. We can see the old square. That is a Block. That's up about 2%. And then followed by that, we have Intellia Therapeutics. That's up about 2%. Coinbase and Robinhood, each of those exchanges up about 1%.

Now, we do want to get a handle on the travel sector as well. We are seeing some outsized losers there. Trip.com down 6 and 3/4 of 1%. Avis Budget, a car group, that's down about 4%. Wynn Resorts down 3%. Now, we do want to take a look at some of these Chinese stocks that have been under pressure. Baidu, after reporting earnings, that is down 6 and 1/2%. Bilibili down 3%. And Yum China down 3%.",2022-08-30T20:10:55+00:00,2022-08-30
801,3 Hot EV Stocks to Buy in September,"Electric vehicle manufacturers got a shot in the arm last week when California announced it would end the sale of 100% gasoline-powered cars and trucks by 2035. While the legislation will allow the sale of plug-in electric hybrids (PHEVs), the news can only help already hot EV stocks.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) approved the requirements, although the Biden administration must give its blessing for the plan to take effect. The requirements also set annual rising zero-emission vehicle rules starting in 2026.

California has led the country in setting strict vehicle emission standards, but more states are likely to follow suit. As they do, demand for electric vehicles will increase. According to CARB, out of the 2 million vehicles estimated to be sold in California in 2035, 183,000 will be PHEVs, while the other roughly 1.8 million will be fully electric.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act also bodes well for EV manufacturers. The legislation provides for unlimited subsidies for EVs, which had previously been capped at 200,000 units per manufacturer.

The easiest way for an investor to profit from rising EV demand is to buy an exchange-traded fund that owns Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other EV manufacturers. However, if you’re looking for outsized gains, and willing to take on a bit more risk, consider these three hot EV stocks.

F Ford $15.45 NIO Nio $19.81 PTRA Proterra $6.02

Ford (NYSE:F) is not likely the first name that comes to mind when you think of hot EV stocks. But the established automaker has some ambitious electric vehicle goals.

By the end of next year, Ford said it will be able to deliver 600,000 EVs a year. By 2026, the company plans to be producing 2 million EVs a year. Last month, Ford said it secured enough electric battery supplies to support its 2023 production goal and about 70% of the battery capacity needed to support its 2026 goal.

Story continues

The company said it will begin offering vehicles with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which are 10%-15% less costly than its existing batteries. It plans to start using these battery packs in the Mustang Mach-E in 2023, followed by the F-150 Lightning pickup truck in early 2024.

“Ford’s new electric vehicle lineup has generated huge enthusiasm and demand, and now we are putting the industrial system in place to scale quickly,” said Ford President and CEO Jim Farley in a statement. “Our Model e team has moved with speed, focus and creativity to secure the battery capacity and raw materials we need to deliver breakthrough EVs for millions of customers.”

Ford’s EV focus has undoubtedly contributed to the stock’s outperformance in recent months. Since the market bottomed in mid-June, F stock is up 42% compared to a 10% rebound in the S&P 500. In the month of July alone, shares gained 32% in their best monthly performance since 2009. Yet, it’s quite possible this is just the start of an extended push higher for this hot EV stock.

In addition to the legislative catalysts mentioned above, Nio(NYSE:NIO) has benefitted recently from two pieces of company-specific news.

On Aug. 26, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had reached an agreement with Chinese regulators that would allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to inspect Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges, thus likely averting a delisting of shares of Nio and others.

The second piece of good news occurred on the same day, with Nio’s rebuttal of allegations of improper accounting made by a short seller earlier this year. Nio said an independent internal review found no improprieties regarding how it accounted for profits and profit margins in its battery-swapping business.

Shares of Nio have rallied nearly 70% from their 52-week low, made in May. Yet, they remain well below their 52-week high of $44.27, set in November 2021. I like NIO’s chances for outsized gains over the next 12 to 18 months.

While companies that manufacture electric passenger cars and trucks tend to get the most attention, makers of commercial EVs also stand to benefit immensely from climate initiatives. Proterra (NASDAQ:PTRA) makes zero-emission electric transit vehicles such as buses, delivery trucks and shuttles, and also sells battery systems to car makers.

Shares rallied sharply earlier this month following the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings report. Revenue was up 27% year over year to $75 million, exceeding analyst estimates. This was due in part to a more than 10x increase in battery system deliveries to a record 348. Proterra also delivered 52 electric buses in the second quarter, 30% higher than its deliveries in the first quarter.

The company’s new factory in South Carolina is expected to start production before the end of the year. This should help alleviate delays, improve scale and efficiency, and deliver higher margins and, ultimately, profitability.

Shares rallied as much as 26% in the two weeks following the earnings announcement, briefly touching the $7 level. Since then, they have given back much of those gains but still sit about 8% higher.

For investors looking to profit from the commercial side of the electric push, PTRA is one of the hottest EV stocks out there.

802,7 Battery Stocks to Buy and Hold for Big-Time Gains,"When it comes to battery stocks to buy and hold, there are a few key things to look for before making a purchase. First, you want to find companies with strong track records of financial stability and profitability. Second, you should pinpoint companies with good reputations in their respective industries. Third, you want to find companies with a strong commitment to growth. Finally, investing in a company that aligns with your values will help ensure that you make sound financial decisions.

The worldwide trend toward renewable energy is largely driven by battery technology. Batteries store renewably generated power and release it when needed, giving EV drivers peace of mind as they go about their day without the worry that a fossil-fuel-powered vehicle will run out at any point during transportation or stationary use.

Battery stocks are down, but investing in these companies is a good idea. It is a rapidly growing space that has the potential to deliver multi-bagger performance once the markets make a comeback.

Battery Stocks to Buy and Hold: NextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.

Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com

NextEra (NYSE:NEE) owns and operates the world’s largest solar- and wind-generating facilities fleet, with 58 gigawatts of capacity in operation or under development. In addition to its generation business, NextEra Energy provides electricity to more than 11 million customers through its subsidiaries Florida Power & Light Company and Gulf Power Company.

When discussing NEE, it is crucial to address the broader macroeconomic developments that will affect the company moving forward. Firstly, President Joe Biden has postponed trade tariffs on solar panels. U.S. companies will have an easier time planning their operations after Biden’s 24-month tariff exemption. Companies will no longer need to worry about holding large sums of cash to pay potential tariffs.

In addition, the Senate has passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and encouraged utilities to use more green energy production. As a result, the operational costs for NextEra Energy will drop. Its latest financial report included $5.18 billion in revenue, up 31.98% versus last year. Meanwhile, net earnings came in at $1.38 billion — an increase of 439%.

Story continues

NextEra has inflation-resistant earnings. The company focuses on wind and solar energy assets. Therefore, the increase in commodity prices does not hurt it much.

One of the world’s largest utility battery storage providers, NEE, will provide a significant portion of the planned 15 gigawatts the government wants to add to the national grid by 2024. Hence, it is in a great position moving forward.

Finally, NextEra Energy, which is a Dividend Aristocrat, has hiked its payout for 25 years in a row. This is an excellent opportunity for income investors to load up on a great performer in the utility space.

Altogether, NextEra has a diversified portfolio, making it less vulnerable to downturns or market fluctuations. It’s one of the best battery stocks to buy and hold.

QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) is a startup that was founded in 2010 to develop solid-state batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). The company has received investment from high-profile backers, including Bill Gates and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY).

QuantumScape’s tech is based on lithium metal, a battery with a higher energy density. Its products are still in the early stages of development. But if the company can commercialize its technology successfully, it could have a major impact on the future of the automotive industry.

By 2025, it hopes to have a commercial production line up and running. However, since the company is pre-revenue, keep in mind that you need to remain patient with this one. For example, my colleague Chris MacDonald touched upon QuantumScape’s worse-than-expected earnings and how it affected QS stock. Such events will continue to impact the stock price moving forward.

However, it’s important to invest in EV technology because the expansion of commercial-scale solid-state batteries will likely continue at even greater rates. There are a lot of challenges associated with bringing solid-state batteries to U.S. roads, but it will also be an important moment in the development of EVs.

The early adoption of these new cars will mean breaking the status-quo bias and turning mass-market thinking toward innovation and sustainability. QuantumScape and its non-combustible, anode-free lithium-metal technology will play a key role in this development. Thus, when discussing battery stocks to buy and hold, QuantumScape will always be in the conversation.

Battery Stocks to Buy and Hold: Honeywell International (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building

Honeywell International (NASDAQ:HON) is a large conglomerate with multiple lines of business. It is now pivoting toward battery technology.

Honeywell has introduced an innovative “flow battery” model that allows utilities to store renewable energy for up to 12 hours. With the new flow battery, you can store energy for later use without worrying about fire or toxic chemicals.

HON stock is also a good income play. The company bought back 7.5 million shares for $1.4 billion in Q2, bringing the year-to-date total to $2.4 billion. It also distributed roughly $690 million in dividends during the same period. Honeywell’s strong cash flow and low debt levels support the dividend, which the company is expected to continue increasing.

This diversified industrial company offers various services and products in aerospace, construction, transportation and more. It is also working on expanding its software and services businesses. The pivot toward battery technology is a smart move that will help the company continue to grow in the future. Honeywell is a well-run company with a sound strategy, well-positioned to continue generating strong shareholder returns. Hence, it is one of the best battery stocks to buy and hold.

Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) is a quality investment and a great company. It makes a variety of electronics, including TVs, home theater systems, cameras, camcorders and more.

The major Japanese multinational conglomerate corporation has many other businesses, such as automotive, avionics, building products, communications, healthcare, lighting and logistics.

Panasonic is also a major player in supplying electric batteries, but it mostly works with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at this point. The company offers an array of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that can power various devices, from laptops to smartphones to cars. It recently sent Tesla samples of its more powerful 4680 electric car battery and is increasing Tesla’s EV battery production by 10%.

Panasonic is also diversifying its business after a period of aggressive restructuring. It expects the debut of its next-generation EV battery to aid this goal. It is also signing agreements with more companies. For example, it has a joint venture with Toyota (NYSE:TM) to develop batteries.

Additionally, Panasonic is building the largest battery plant in Kansas, which will provide battery packs to EV makers. Its other U.S. plant, in Reno, Nevada, was started with Tesla and has helped to supply over 6 billion EV battery cells. However, the new plant will help Panasonic move beyond Tesla.

When discussing EV battery stocks to buy and hold, we rarely, if ever, get the opportunity to analyze a company as solid as Panasonic. It has been among the most reliable, diverse and innovative companies. It continues to grow in many industries while introducing innovations that will improve it in the long term.

Imagine a battery that never needs to be replaced. One with an unlimited lifespan and unparalleled safety features, making it the perfect choice for your next electric car.

A company called Solid Power (NASDAQ: SLDP) specializes in developing this revolutionary technology — better known as solid-state batteries — and its product could soon revolutionize how we think about energy storage solutions worldwide.

Solid Power’s batteries are made with a solid electrolyte instead of a liquid one. It makes them less likely to leak or catch fire. The company is working on a new generation of Solid Power batteries that will be even more energy-dense than the current ones.

It is already working with several major automakers, including Ford (NYSE:F) and BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY), to bring its technology to market.

More recently, the Colorado-based battery startup reported an excellent set of earnings. Revenues for the second quarter and the first half of the year came in at $2.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, representing a substantial increase over the year-ago period. However, the company also reported an operating loss of $14.7 million due to product development investments and scaled-back operations.

But with cash of $534.2 million in its coffers, you need not worry much about the enterprise’s financial position. Solid Power intends to start production of EV-scales battery cells for internal testing next quarter, despite supply-chain issues.

Solid Power plans on sending batteries to automakers by 2023. In that case, these components will start shipping the following year. And thanks to its unique technology, automakers won’t need to modify production lines to get things moving.

Lithium (NYSE:LAC) is a valuable resource that powers our modern world. The U.S. produces just 1% of global lithium production. Hence, new sources are needed to keep up with the growing demand for this essential mineral.

Lithium Americas owns four main assets in the lithium-mining business. Its biggest asset by far is its reserves located at Thacker Pass, Nevada — home to the largest U.S. mineral reserves.

With the rise of electric cars, demand for lithium will continue to rise exponentially. By 2030, demand for lithium will be around three million to four million metric tons from around 500,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2021. With this backdrop, Lithium Americas’ projects will continue to do well, setting up an aggressive path for LAC as a growth stock.

Lithium Americas is yet to be an operational miner — be prepared for boom, bust and boom again. Buying and holding a stock is often advised because it helps you avoid toiling with the short-term market. Instead, focus on long-term success. Keep that in mind when loading up on LAC stock.

Battery Stocks to Buy and Hold: Freyr Battery (FREY) An image of the outline of a battery reflecting a blue sky with light clouds.

Freyr Battery (NYSE:FREY) is a battery developer and producer in Norway. The company specializes in developing high-power, long-lasting batteries. Freyr creates batteries and energy storage products for markets like electric cars, stationary power and consumer electronics. The goal is to provide affordable and reliable solutions for these industries.

Freyr Battery is building its first Gigafactory in Mo i Rana, Norway, and has increased its per-year output target to over 200 GWh by 2030. The future, therefore, is bright for this one.

Despite being a new company, it has contracts with some of the biggest names in the business, including Siemens Energy (OTCMKTS:SMNEY) and Powin Energy.

While these contracts are a promising sign, FREYR is still at a nascent stage. It has a lot of room for growth and expansion, which is why this company is one of the best battery stocks to buy and hold.

806,7 Hot Growth Stocks to Buy in September,"Based on the market’s recent performance, you may think now isn’t the time to increase exposure to hot growth stocks. After all, aren’t rising interest rates and the growing likelihood of a recession bad news for growth?

Yes and no. On one hand, there are plenty of high-fliers from the 2020/2021 bull market that will likely continue to face challenges in the near term. Some of them, due to their poor fundamentals, face murky prospects in the long term.

But while that’s the case for many growth plays, it’s not the case for all of them. Top-rated names in this category could begin to recover much sooner than current sentiment suggests. In addition, there are several picks you may not associate with the term “growth stock,” yet could be just that as they are the beneficiaries of some powerful trends.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

With this, consider it high time to pick up these seven hot growth stocks this September. After the recent market pullback, each has fallen to a favorable entry price.

AAPL Apple $158.91 ALB Albemarle $272.77 DVN Devon Energy $71.08 NEE NextEra Energy $85.70 ON ON Semiconductor $68.97 SQM Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile $102.35 TSLA Tesla $277.70

As the largest stock by market cap, you may think Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) days of high growth are behind it. With its outstanding shares worth nearly $2.6 trillion, admittedly it’ll take a lot to move the needle.

Fortunately, though, there are several big growth catalysts in play. In the short term, new product launches could help to reaccelerate growth. And I’m not just talking about the rumored upcoming launch of the iPhone 14. I’m also talking about the launch of a new Apple Watch model, plus the debut of its augmented and mixed reality headset.

In the long run, the company could “level up,” and so too could AAPL stock, if it brings a self-driving electric vehicle to market in a few years’ time.

Story continues

After pulling back over the past two weeks, September may be the perfect time to enter/add to a position in AAPL stock.

Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a good example of what I meant when I said not all the stocks on this list may immediately be thought of as growth plays. So, what makes this specialty chemicals company a hot growth stock?

Its high exposure to the proliferation of EVs. Albemarle is a leading provider of lithium used to build EV batteries. Unlike other commodities, which spiked earlier this year due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine only to sink due to recession fears, lithium prices have held onto their supply shock gains.

Albemarle is cashing in big time. Analysts are expecting a 124% year-over-year jump in 2022 revenue and 404% YOY earnings growth. Best of all, while ALB stock is up 17% so far this year, it continues to trade at a relatively low forward earnings multiple of 14.2x.

ALB stock earns a B rating in my Portfolio Grader.

Oil and gas company Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is another good example of how when I say “hot growth stock,” I’m not just talking about names in sectors like big tech or clean energy. Carbon-free energy may be the future, but for the time being, fossil fuels reign supreme.

Couple that with this year’s oil and gas supply challenges, and it’s no surprise this stock has been crushing it over the past 12 months. While major indices have sunk, DVN stock surged 134%. Don’t assume, however, that you’ve missed the boat if you’ve yet to add it to your portfolio.

Despite concerns about the impact of a recession on demand, analysts continue to anticipate crude oil prices will remain elevated over the next few years. This points to continued strong earnings and big dividend payouts from Devon.

DVN stock earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.

NextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen

Among the “green wave” hot growth stocks, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is definitely one of the most interesting. It’s part old-school utility company (it owns Florida Power & Light) and part clean energy provider. As a result, NEE stock offers investors the best of both worlds.

If you are looking for steady income from an investment, this stock has you covered. It currently pays out $1.70 per year in dividends for a 1.9% forward yield. Not only that, but with 26 years of consecutive dividend growth, it’s a bona fide Dividend Aristocrat.

If you’re looking for high-growth potential, NextEra has you covered, as well. The move to energy sources like solar and wind, possibly accelerated by the Inflation Reduction Act, will help to drive continued earnings growth. This, in turn, will enable the stock to grow its valuation over time.

Lately, strong demand from end users like the auto industry has resulted in big growth for ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON). As I recently discussed, when the chipmaker last reported earnings, it handily beat estimates. Revenue and earnings were up substantially from the prior year’s quarter, at 25% and 143%, respectively.

Earnings are expected to decline next year, which is why the stock trades at a fairly low forward valuation of 14.1x earnings. However, it’s possible investors are overestimating how much industrial chip demand will fall during an economic downturn.

The CHIPS and Science Act, which was signed into law in early August, bodes well for the company. This piece of legislation provides billions in subsidies to help domestic chipmakers increase their production capacity. Already in the midst of expanding its manufacturing capabilities, ON Semiconductor is well-positioned to benefit from this bill.

ON stock earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.

Like Albemarle, Sociedad Quimica Y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is another old-school name that’s become a high-growth stock thanks to the lithium boom. However, this basic materials giant has also benefited from a second recent trend — the big jump in fertilizer prices.

The run-up in fertilizer prices due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict has resulted in a tremendous jump in revenue and earnings. For 2022, Sociedad Quimica Y Minera de Chile is expected to see revenue growth of 216% and earnings growth of 469% to $11.66 per share.

Of course, a lot of this growth has already been factored into SQM’s stock price. Shares are up 103% year to date. Even so, trading at 7.3x forward earnings and sporting a 10.6% dividend yield, there’s a lot of value (and growth potential) left in this stock.

SQM stock earns an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.

Up over 1,000% in the past five years and sporting a market cap of $870 billion, skeptics may believe all the growth potential is already priced into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and then some.

Yet, there is a path for TSLA stock to not only hold onto its gains from recent years but to hit new highs. How? First, the EV revolution isn’t going away. In fact, thanks to the expansion of EV tax credits, U.S. motorists could switch over even sooner than previously expected.

Second, the launch of new models (like the Cybertruck) and the release of new innovations can enable Tesla shares to reach the next level. As InvestorPlace’s Samuel O’Brient reported on Aug. 29, the company’s fully self-driving vehicles could soon hit the roads. Far from peaking, Tesla is another one of the hot growth stocks to buy in September.

TSLA stock earns a B rating in my Portfolio Grader.

807,Chinese Automobile Stocks Slump After Warren Buffett Trims BYD Stake,"By Ambar Warrick

Investing.com-- Major Chinese automobile stocks slumped on Wednesday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) sold part of its stake in automaker BYD Co.

Shenzhen-listed shares of BYD (SZ:002594) sank over 7% in morning trade, while those of China’s big four carmakers- Guangzhou Automobile Group (SS:601238), SAIC Motor (SS:600104), Chongqing Changan Automobile (SZ:000625) and Faw Car (SZ:000800) sank between 2% and 5%.

BYD’s (HK:1211) Hong Kong shares plummeted over 10%, and were the worst performers on the Hang Seng index. Losses in automobile stocks also dragged China’s blue chip Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index down 0.6%.

A filing on Tuesday showed that Berkshire Hathaway cut its stake in BYD to 19.9% from 20.04% last week. The move comes after weeks of speculation over the move, after Berkshire mobilized its shares onto Hong Kong's settlement system in July.

BYD is China’s largest electric vehicle maker, recently overtaking Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in terms of global sales. The firm also logged a nearly 300% jump in its net income for the first six months of 2022.

But Berkshire’s stake sale may indicate doubts over the firm’s future prospects, especially with economic activity in China grinding to a halt due to COVID-19 lockdowns.

BYD and most of its peers faced severe manufacturing headwinds earlier this year from a lockdown in the major hub of Shanghai.

Buffett’s Berkshire is also collecting bumper profits from its sale of BYD shares. The hedge fund had first purchased 225 million shares in BYD in 2008, for about $230 million, according to Bloomberg.

Since then, Hong Kong-listed shares of the firm have surged over 2000%.

To skip our detailed analysis of the first six stocks and the electric vehicle sector as a whole, you can go directly to the 5 Best Electric Vehicle Stocks to Buy Now.

With a rapid shift in focus to renewable energy and sustainable use of energy resources, electric vehicles (EVs) have become more popular over recent years. At first, only new companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) were embarking on the challenge to produce EVs, but as the years progressed, many other similar companies have popped up across the world. According to the International Energy Agency's Global EV Outlook 2022, as of this May, the EV sector grew to the point where global sales of EVs rose to 2 million in the first quarter alone. This represented a 75% increase compared to the first quarter of 2021.

Now, even conventional automobile manufacturing companies such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) have begun to develop EVs. The growth of the EV sector has also resulted in large amounts of funds being poured into it. According to Bloomberg, over $4.8 billion was poured into the EV charging industry as of August 2022. About $650 million were invested into the sector by Blackrock, Daimler Truck, and NextEra Energy Resources in the US.

It was also estimated that more than 73% of the investment going into the EV and EV charging sectors in 2021 went into ultra-fast charging, according to BloombergNEF. The strong investment trend in the EV-charging sector can be attributed to the growth in the electric vehicle sector as a whole, and in light of more government funds being allotted to the production and sale of EVs. 11 best autonomous vehicle stocks to buy now

In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information.

Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio, have just started trading on this stock market.”

814,Ulta Beauty and Meta Platforms have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – August 31, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA as the Bull of the Day and Meta Platforms, Inc. META as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tesla TSLA, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Bull of the Day:

Ulta Beauty, Inc. is the largest U.S. beauty retailer and its business continues to thrive amid economic slowdown fears and inflation concerns. Ulta topped quarterly estimates on August 25 and raised its outlook once again as shoppers continue to spend big on the simple pleasures in life such as beauty.

Beauty is Booming

Ulta Beauty began to reshape the broader beauty retail space back in the early 1990s by bringing everything under one roof. Today, its rather large format stores offer cosmetics, fragrances, skin care products, hair care, salon services, and more. Ulta sells an array of brands across a variety of areas and price points from higher-end companies to its own store brands.

Ulta operates roughly 1,300 retail locations across all 50 states. Alongside its brick-and-mortar retail footprint, Ulta's e-commerce offerings are gaining traction. The company is focused on rolling out more how-to-style videos, tips, and tutorials online. This helps mimic Ulta's hands-on customer experience at stores that allows shoppers to try on and test various products with the help of its sales associates.

Ulta's ability to expand its footprint and its customer base has helped it grow its top and bottom lines at truly impressive clips. Ulta opened 17 new stores and relocated 10 stores during the first six months of FY22 even as other retailers backed off on spending.

Ulta posted double-digit revenue growth every year since its public debut in late 2007, outside of a pandemic/ lockdown pullback, with shoppers having far fewer reasons to do their hair and makeup. Ulta, at one point, posted a stretch of eight-straight years of roughly 20% or higher revenue growth.

Story continues

Ulta bounced back in a huge way following its covid slip, with FY21 revenue up 40%. Plus, its adjusted earnings soared from $3.11 per share to $17.98 per share in 2021, which also crushed its pre-pandemic total of $12.15 a share.

Recent Growth & Improved Outlook

Ulta's second quarter fiscal 2022 revenue jumped 17% to help lift its adjusted earnings by 25%. More importantly, the company raised its guidance as it sees strong trends in the beauty space despite slowing overall consumer spending and inflation headwinds.

Ulta raised its revenue outlook for the year to between $9.65 billion and $9.75 billion, up from $9.35 to $9.55 billion. Plus, it lifted its comparable sales guidance all the way to 9.5% to 10.5% vs. its previous 6% to 8% range. And it now expects adjusted earnings per share between $20.70 to $21.20 compared to its prior $19.20 to $20.10 guidance.

Analysts raced to update their EPS estimates following Ulta's beat-and-raise release on August 25. The company's upbeat bottom-line revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and it's crushed our EPS estimates by an average of 33% in the trailing four periods.

Current Zacks estimates call for Ulta's revenue to climb 14% in 2022 to slightly under $10 billion and nearly 8% higher in FY23. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to climb 18% this year and another 10% in 2023. And both of Ulta's current FY22 and FY23 consensus estimates could move even higher.

Outperformance and Value

Ulta stock is bucking the market's downturn so far this year, with its shares up around 1% vs. its industry's 23% decline and the S&P 500's 16% drop. This is part of an 80% run over the past 24 months to blow away the market and its broader Zacks econ sector. And the nearby chart showcases Ulta's 340% surge in the last decade.

At around $410 per share, Ulta trades 17% below its current Zacks average price target. On the valuation front, Ulta is trading at a discount to the wider retail space at 19.0X forward earnings vs. 22.6X. More importantly, the stock is trading at a 50% discount to its own 10-year highs and offers 28% value vs. its median despite its strong price performance.

Bottom Line

Ulta is set to repurchase roughly $900 million worth of its own shares in FY22. The firm is able to support these buybacks through a sturdy balance sheet and a strong management team. Plus, the beauty industry is booming and it shows no signs of stopping in a world dominated by social media and staying on trend.

Ulta's business remains strong in the face of slowing consumer spending because shoppers aren't cutting back on its beauty offerings. It is also worth remembering that many higher-income shoppers are still flush with cash and spending on everything from travel to makeup. And there is even an established phenomenon known as the lipstick effect that highlights a willingness to buy the small, fun things when people can't splurge on big-ticket items.

It has been no easy task to stay above the selling in 2022 and fewer and fewer companies are providing upbeat guidance. Therefore, it might not be surprising to know that 17 of the 21 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for Ulta are ""Strong Buys,"" with nothing below a ""Hold.""

Bear of the Day:

Mark Zuckerberg's company has been on a wild ride since it decided to change its name from Facebook to Meta Platforms, Inc. last year.

Things have not gone well for Meta in 2022, and its outlook turned a lot worse after it reported its second quarter results at the end of July.

Identity Crisis?

Zuckerberg announced last October that his social media company that owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more would soon be known as Meta Platforms. The firm is currently pouring billions of dollars and tons of resources into the metaverse, betting that people will eventually live some of their lives in a new digital world via avatars.

The metaverse reality is still years off and it might not ever come to fruition. In the here and now, Meta's traditional social media apps are being negatively impacted by Apple's privacy changes that require apps to ask users whether they want to be tracked.

Meta said when it reported its Q4 FY21 results that Apple's tracking changes could cost it $10 billion in lost sales in 2022 alone. Apple's changes have impacted Snap and countless others. Things haven't improved much since then as advertisers also pull back on spending across the digital economy amid an economic slowdown.

Most recently, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram reported its first-ever decline in revenue, with sales down around 1%. The company also fell short of our EPS estimate and provided downbeat guidance.

Bottom Line

The nearby chart showcases how far Meta's FY22 and FY23 consensus EPS estimates have fallen, down 16% and 22%, respectively. Meta's downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.

Zacks estimates call for Meta's revenue to dip 1.3% in 2022, with it projected to post 11% higher sales in 2023. But its days of 20% or more sales growth might be over, at least for now. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to fall by 30% this year and only climb 13% in FY23 to come in well short of its FY21 levels.

Meta is still a strong company with 2022 sales set to top $115 billion in a down year. Meta also boasts an impressive balance sheet and reaches billions of people a day via its various platforms.

Still, investors might want to stay away from Meta for the moment because Wall Street is dumping it amid all of the digital ad fears, TikTok competition worries, and its big bets on the metaverse.

Should You Buy Tesla (TSLA) Post-Stock Split?

Electric vehicle (EV) behemoth, Tesla recently completed a 3-for-1 stock split, making its shares more attractive to retail investors. Is the stock worth a buy now post the split at its current price levels of around $280 a piece?

Stock Split Back in Fashion

When Tesla last split its stock in August 2020, shares skyrocketed, thanks to an influx of new buyers and increased liquidity. Shares have been on a massive run since then, with the company joining the elite $1-trillion club in October 2021. The stock had become quite expensive for investors who were a little tighter on the budget, grinding down the overall trading volume and driving away potential investors.

Noting the steep price tag of Tesla shares, the company again decided to split its stock, making its shares more affordable. In June 2022, TSLA announced that its board approved a three-for-one stock split, subject to shareholder approval at the company's annual meeting on Aug 4.

Stock splits have actually gained massive traction over the past few years. It's one of the more positive announcements that shareholders can receive. Besides Tesla, we've witnessed several market titans undergo a stock split so far in 2022, including Amazon and Alphabet.

Amazon announced its 20-for-1 split back in early March, representing the company's first split since 1999. Needless to say, it shocked the market. The split went into effect a few months later, on Jun 6.Back in February, Alphabet announced its plans to split its stock 20-for-1. Like AMZN, buyers came out in full force for GOOGL shares. Alphabet shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis on Jul 18.

Of course, a stock split doesn't affect a company's market capitalization. However, it lowers the price of each share, providing ease for the stock price to multiply once again and offering investors with sizable gains.

Coming back to Tesla, we believe that the company has a host of potential catalysts surrounding it, which makes it an attractive buy now.

Key Growth Drivers

Over the years, EV maker Tesla has evolved into a dynamic technology innovator. It is the market leader in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States, with roughly 70% market share. The company's flagship Model 3 is the best-selling EV model in the United States. Model Y has also gained immense popularity.

The automaker is riding on the robust demand for Models 3 and Y, which form a major chunk of its total deliveries. Deliveries of Model 3/Y witnessed a CAGR of more than 74% between 2019 and 2021. Musk remains optimistic about meeting the average annual deliveries growth target of 50% over a multi-year horizon. Production ramp-up at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck from next year, are set to support deliveries growth.

High volumes are aiding Tesla in achieving cost and production efficiencies, thereby strengthening margins. While the temporary decline in Shanghai production volume resulted in a sequential fall in gross margins in the last reported quarter, the metric is likely to show improvement in the second half of 2022.

Tesla posted the sixth straight earnings beat in the last reported quarter. Even in the face of harsh business conditions, the company's top and bottom lines in the second quarter grew 41.6% and 56.5%, respectively.

The company has had zero issues with generating serious revenue growth. Since 2016, Tesla's annual revenue has soared 668%. TSLA has managed to grow its annual revenues by double-digit percentages each year since 2012. Thanks to strong deliveries and a rise in the average selling price of vehicles, we believe Tesla would maintain its upward trajectory in automotive revenues.

Tesla's energy generation and storage revenues are also growing, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products. The efforts to strengthen its balance sheet are also praiseworthy.  Simply put, Tesla seems to be firing on all cylinders.

For the current fiscal year (FY22), the EV titan is projected to generate $85 billion in revenues, implying a double-digit uptick of nearly 58% year over year. In FY23, the top line is forecast to rise by an additional 41%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FY22 earnings per share is pegged at $3.73, suggesting year-over-year growth of 65%. The bottom line is projected to increase another additional 35.5% in FY23.

Final Thoughts

While Tesla continues to look grossly overvalued, its share price has anyway long been divorced from the company's fundamentals. As an auto manufacturer delivering roughly a million cars per year, it would need to increase production by 16 times to reach fair value. But then again, Tesla is not just any other auto manufacturer but also a battery/software developer, a solar tech company and an innovation powerhouse. In fact, TSLA is often labeled by many as a tech company.

Tesla's innovative engine, brand value and growth prospects are way better than other companies in the same space. So even as the EV market gathers momentum with competition heating up, Tesla looks set to remain a leading player.

So, with its shares being well below its all-time highs post stock split, TSLA is worth scooping up now for long-term gains. For investors who can swallow elevated valuation levels and are looking for companies with robust growth prospects, Tesla should be on the top of their list.

Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

816,"Tesla (TSLA) Fully Self-Driven Cars to Hit US, Europe by 2022-End","At an energy conference in Norway, Tesla Inc.’s TSLA CEO Elon Musk recently announced that the company is targeting the end of 2022 for its self-driving technology to be widely available in the United States and Europe markets. The exact timeline depends on regulatory approvals.

Tesla's existing Full Self-Driving package or FSD needs to be retrofitted to a vehicle at $15,000. The current features in the FSD package allow the vehicle to autonomously stop at signs and traffic lights, park, react to traffic while in cruise control and steer on both freeways and city streets. However, it still requires supervision from a driver.

The updated version will allow vehicles to drive independently without requiring a human occupant.

For a long time, Musk has been stating that Tesla’s self-driving cars will hit the roads soon. In May, Musk announced that self-driving cars will be made available within a year. Since 2020, he has been making announcements that Tesla will offer 1 million robot taxis by the end of the year, but the company has not been successful so far.

However, recently, Musk changed the plan and declared that Tesla will bring 1 million people in FSD Beta. There is a significant difference between the two. While the term robotaxi indicates that a vehicle can provide a taxi service without a driver at the wheel, Tesla’s FSD Beta necessitates a driver behind the wheel at all times, ready to take control.

Musk stated that owners of the fully autonomous Tesla vehicles might send them out as a ride-hailing service while they are at work, allowing them to earn some extra income instead of keeping the cars parked, which in turn entails a fee.

Earlier in the month, the U.K. government declared that it will allow cars, coaches and lorries with self-driving features on motorways in 2023.

Initially, only features such as lane-keeping technology will be made legal, and fully autonomous self-driving cars, where motorists can check emails or watch TV behind the wheel, will not be allowed until 2025.

Tesla has been targeting 2024 for mass production of its robot taxi fleet. If the company can inch closer to its mission, it will take the entire auto industry by storm and go on to retain its un-championed position in the EV space.

Shares of TSLA have jumped 13.5% over the past year against its industry’s 2% decline.

Tesla (TSLA)is the most popular stock on social media according to a study that analysed data from TikTok viewing numbers and Instagram posts focused on stocks to see which are being talked about on social media the most.

Elon Musk’s company has more than 45,400,000 views on TikTok, posted with the hashtag #TeslaStock, and 28,391 posts hashtagged with the same thing, according to financial services provider CMC Markets.

Tesla is also the second most searched stock in the UK on Google according to Ahrefs, with more than 282,000 searches a month.

AMC Entertainment (AMC)was the second most popular stock across social media. TikToks hashtagged with #AMCStock have attracted more than 25,800,000 views on the platform, and 14,834 Instagram posts have been made to date. It is also the most popular stock based on Google searches from Ahrefs, with more than 490,000 searches monthly in the UK.

In third place is Apple (AAPL), with more than 11,700,000 views on TikToks posted with the hashtag #AppleStock, and 12,436 Instagram posts made with the hashtag. The stock also receives more than 55,000 monthly Google searches in the UK based on data from Ahrefs.

GameStop (GME) takes fourth place on the list, following closely behind Apple with 14,100,000 views on TikTok for hashtagged posts and 8,871 posts captioned with the hashtag #GameStopStock.

Amazon (AMZN) is the fifth most popular on social media, with more than 6,900,000 total views on TikTok for posts hashtagged with #AmazonStock and 3,155 hashtagged Instagram posts to go along with this.

“While these findings might illustrate what stocks get coverage on social media, it also shows the sheer amount of views one can get from posting about them. Many people are turning to social media for their information on the stock market and even tips and tricks for using it properly,” a spokesperson for CMC Markets said.

819,3 EV Stocks That Could 10X by 2026,"For investors who are bold and contrarian, making a 1,000% gain on a stock over several years isn’t as hard as it may sound. That’s particularly true regarding out-of-favor electric vehicle (EV) stocks and renewable energy stocks, since those relatively new sectors are rapidly evolving and expanding.

Although I haven’t made a 1,000% profit with an EV stock yet, I did with one renewable-energy stock and came relatively close to doing so with another. In late 2019, I bought Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock when it was around $3 per share and sold a portion of my shares when the price was about $40 in 2021.

With JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS), I thought of buying some shares around $7.50 during the December 2018 bloodbath, but I decided not to do so. I did wind up buying a small amount of JKS  stock around $13 later that month and sold a portion of my stake in November 2020 at around $75.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

And of course, in the EV sector itself, many investors increased their money tenfold or more by betting on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) during its long climb.

Here are four vastly underestimated, highly promising EV stocks that can follow in the footsteps of PLUG, JKS and TSLA by jumping tenfold by 2026.

ARVL Arrival $1.10 AYRO Ayro $0.89 NKLA Nikola $5.32

Arrival (ARVL) An electric vehicle charger is seen next to a row of blue electric buses.

Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL) has been much maligned in the financial news media because the automaker has had to delay its production timeline multiple times. However, the company has already achieved a great deal.

Among its accomplishments are European Union (EU) certification for its van and successful trials of its van and bus on public roads. And as of Aug. 11, Arrival reported that it was only a few weeks away from starting production in the U.K. and still on track to “deliver its first vehicles to UPS this year, and start production in Charlotte in 2023.”

Speaking of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), the alliance between the delivery giant and ARVL appears to be very much alive, with UPS’s initial order for 10,000 Arrival EVs still intact.

Story continues

Also boding well for Arrival is the fact it was chosen by Uber (NYSE:UBER) to jointly develop a ride-sharing EV and that the two companies unveiled a prototype of the vehicle. Their successful collaboration indicates Uber was pleased with Arrival’s concepts and technology.

Given Arrival’s huge deal with UPS, the progress it has made on its van so far, the company’s collaboration with Uber and the fact its market capitalization is only $720 million, ARVL stock could easily jump ten-fold in four years.

Ayro  (AYRO) EV stocks: Electric vehicle logo painted on a blue street

Like Arrival, Ayro (NASDAQ:AYRO) has impressive partnerships and a low valuation, along with a couple of setbacks it can overcome. It also has found a lucrative niche with low competition: the low-speed truck sector, which includes food service, food delivery and campus delivery EVs.

Ayro has long had an alliance with Gallery Carts, a major food truck maker. As I reported in August 2020,  Gallery “has made carts and kiosks for four decades and ‘has a diverse clientele throughout mobile food, beverage and merchandise distribution markets.'” Moreover, the company boasts “many high-profile, lucrative contracts” and customers ranging from airports to governments and large corporations.

Ayro has also had an alliance with Club Car, which has been making various low-speed vehicles for over 60 years. Together, Ayro, Gallery and Club Car rolled out a delivery EV called the Club Car Current. And in the second quarter of this year, Ayro reported its sales had surged 88% year-over-year to roughly $982,000.

Now, Ayro is developing a more technologically advanced low-speed utility vehicle called the Ayro Z. A prototype is expected to be unveiled this year. I believe Ayro will use its ties with Gallery Carts and Club Car to help sell the Ayro Z.

It appears the federal government may also be an important customer for the new EV, as Ayro intends to make the EV in the U.S. and plans “to be listed on the government’s GSA schedule by year-end as well to help facilitate vehicle sales into the federal government channel.”

In the past, Ayro has had to deal with multiple challenges, including overspending during the tenure of its previous CEO, Rod Keller, and defective parts that it received from its previous China-based manufacturer, Cenntro. But with its new, more frugal CEO, its updated manufacturing plan, its partnerships and its new EVs, Ayro is well-positioned to be quite successful going forward.

The market capitalization of AYRO stock is only $33 million, so the shares could potentially jump ten times by 2026.

Probably the most ridiculed and belittled EV maker ever, Nikola is starting to prove the skeptics wrong by successfully obtaining 134 purchase orders for its Nikola Tre electric truck and delivering 48 of the EVs.

Nikola expects to produce 300 to 500 of the trucks this year and is partnering with a large veteran truck maker, IVECO, on the manufacturing of the Nikola Tre. The companies plan to make battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell versions of the Tre.

Six companies are testing the battery-electric Tre and are likely to cumulatively order hundreds of the vehicles. Moreover, the Tre’s range is an impressive 350 miles, and, according to Seeking Alpha columnist  Stephen Tobin, the battery-electric version of the EV is “leading the field at the moment, it is showing excellent reliability over large numbers of miles, and … is the longest-range truck currently in serial production.”

Meanwhile, Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) is testing the fuel-cell version of the Tre, and Nikola expects to start mass production of the truck at the end of 2023. Given the proliferation of green hydrogen around the world and the support of the fuel many governments, including that of the U.S., there should be strong demand for Nikola’s hydrogen-driven trucks.

Also importantly, as I’ve pointed out in past columns, hydrogen trucks can haul much bigger loads than battery-electric EVs and can be refueled much more quickly than battery-electric trucks, while Nikola is a first-mover in the hydrogen-truck sector.

Greatly understating Nikola’s huge potential in the electric-truck market, the market capitalization of NKLA stock is just $2.35 billion. Consequentially, I believe it can soar ten times by 2026.

821,3 Picks That Could Be the Next Meme Stock Champion,"For those unfamiliar with the term, a meme stock is a stock that has seen an increase in price due to attention on social media platforms like Reddit. In recent months, we’ve seen meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) skyrocket in value, much to the surprise of traditional investors. So, who will be the next meme stock champion?

There are a few contenders for the title. One possibility is BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), which has already seen a surge in interest due to its association with Reddit. Another possibility is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has long been a favorite of online investors.

Of course, predicting the next meme stock is no easy task. The market is highly volatile and ever-changing. Nevertheless, active investors should keep an eye on this area if it wants to take advantage of the monstrous gains Reddit users are known to induce.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

We’re interested in finding the next meme stock champion, so we’re avoiding the more popular names on this list. Investors know about AMC, GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) as key Reddit stocks. However, this article will discuss some stocks that do not often enter the conversation around meme stocks.

So, if you’re looking to get in on the action, keep an eye on the following three stocks. The next meme stock champion could be just around the corner.

PLTR Palantir Technologies $7.73 SIGA Siga Technologies $15.08 NIO Nio $19.95

Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) has developed a groundbreaking platform that allows users to access, organize and analyze data of all kinds. The company’s products are used by some of the world’s largest organizations, including the U..S intelligence community, law enforcement agencies and major corporations. Palantir is constantly innovating and expanding its products and services. The company is well on its way to becoming a major player in the data analytics market.

Story continues

The major argument against investing in Palantir is its lack of commercial clients. The majority of Palantir clients remain government agencies. While this provides the data analytics company with smooth recurring cash flow, it does not give Palantir bulls what they are craving, which are lucrative commercial contracts that invite less scrutiny.

The latest figures show progress on the commercial side. In the latest quarterly results, Palantir reported a 120% year-over-year increase in its U.S. commercial revenue. Some of the top clients who use Palantir’s Foundry platform are Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU). The company recently inked deals with homeownership platformBetter and healthcare technology companyMCI Onehealth. All of these developments lead me to believe PLTR knows where it needs to improve.

Palantir is a great investment for those who are patient. The company has a unique operating model that is different from other companies in the industry. Palantir is looking to diversify its revenues from just government contracts, which will pay dividends in the future. The company’s commercial clients are growing, and that will help Palantir to achieve its long-term goals.

Reddit investors are also noticing; PLTR consistently ranks among the most discussed stocks on r/WallStreetBets. Therefore, you cannot rule out Palantir as the next big meme stock champion.

Siga Technologies (SIGA) Hands of medical professional holding a syringe, symbolizing PFE, MRNA stock.

Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) was once a small pharmaceutical company. However, it made headlines after developing a vaccine to combat Covid-19, and its growth story continues today. Moderna’s story is a reminder of the importance of a seminal event in a company’s fortunes. While the company was already doing important work before the pandemic, it was the development of a vaccine that made Moderna a household name. In today’s global economy, adapting to change and seizing opportunities are essential for success. Moderna is a prime example of a company that has done just that.

Many investors believe Siga Technologies (NASDAQ:SIGA) can follow a similar trajectory. The reason is monkeypox, an ongoing epidemic that has infected about 50,000 people as of this writing. Siga has a treatment for monkeypox that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has made available under “compassionate use.” Siga shares are up more than 130% this year as people became hopeful about its success.

The fate of SIGA shares will ultimately be decided by whether monkeypox becomes a big enough crisis like Covid-19. If that happens, we can expect Siga to become a multibagger, as it will help solve a global healthcare issue. It’s a risk, but that is the very nature of Reddit investing, which is why you cannot discount SIGA Technologies as the next meme stock champion.

Nio (NIO) A large NIO store sign and Chinese brand name. NIO is a Chinese EV company

Nio (NYSE:NIO) is an electric vehicle (EV) company that has emerged recently with the potential to challenge Tesla. It has a close affiliation with the Chinese government, which gives it a huge advantage. China is the largest EV market, and Nio’s connection to the Chinese government is worth its weight in gold. Nio has already made a name for itself in China and is now expanding globally.

Nio is growing in international markets. It had a successful launch in Norway last year and is set for more releases in Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden this coming year. Furthermore, it has plans to enter the American market by 2025. Nio’s expansion into these markets shows that it is looking to reduce its reliance on the Chinese market and become a global company.

Recently, Nio has been facing headwinds due to the broader supply chain issues affecting the world economy and China’s zero-Covid approach, which led to the closure of several major Chinese cities. However, a recent stimulus package by China shows that things are changing in the aftermath of an energy crisis.

Apart from these broader macroeconomic factors, Nio bulls have other reasons to rejoice. The EV maker has developed a unique battery-swapping system that allows drivers to extend the range of their vehicles. Nio also offers a wide range of self-driving features, making it one of the leading companies in autonomous driving technology. As the electric vehicle market grows, Nio is positioned as a major player.

Video Transcript

DAVE BRIGGS: All right, just a couple of minutes from the closing bell. A lot of red on the board at the moment. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre to break down today's market action. Dr. J.

JARED BLIKRE: That's right. We got a down day capping what's likely a down month-- a down month-- unless we have some kind of miracle happening in the last couple of minutes here. Here's the Dow. It's going to be down about 4%. We've got 23 trading days in this month. S&P 500 down 4%, NASDAQ a little bit more, and the Russell 2000 about 2%, we'll call it that.

But let's take a look at some of the heatmaps, see what we've been doing for the month. This is going to be the NASDAQ 100. And let us just put that month to date figure on. You can see Apple the biggest bellwether here. That is down about 3%. And then you have Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon all down about 6%, 7% themselves, and the semiconductors really taking it on the chin. Nvidia down about 16 and 1/2% right there.

Let's check out the sector leaders and laggards. Only energy and utilities finishing in the green and not by much. To the downside, we have XLK. That is the tech sector. That is down 6% followed by healthcare, real estate, consumer discretionary. Those are all the underperformers.

And if you take a look at our leaders and sentiment, only KWEB-- that is Chinese stocks. That is an ETF for that. That is up 5 and 1/2%. Everything else underwater. We were talking about those chip stocks, the Philly Chip Stock Index. That's down about 10%. ARK Invest, that's down 7%. Homebuilders, transport, software, corporate bonds, high yield bonds, Korean stocks, all of those are underperforming the S&P 500.",2022-08-31T20:20:32+00:00,2022-08-31

Mobility fintech Moove is expanding its vehicle financing business to the UK after previously launching in countries such as India and Nigeria. Moove is already Uber’s largest vehicle supply partner across Europe, the Mideast and Africa.

Launched in 2020 by entrepreneurs Ladi Delano and Jide Odunsi, Amsterdam-based Moove has raised more than $200 million and is backed by investors that include the UK government’s British International Investment arm. The company aims to make it easier for ride-hailing and food delivery gig workers to get a vehicle with no deposit or credit check, relying instead on an alternative underwriting model.

Amid skyrocketing energy prices, Moove is also seeing a rise in demand for its electric vehicles, Co-Chief Executive Officer Delano said in an interview. He said the most popular car model financed by Moove is Tesla Inc.’s Model 3.

“A lot of our customers are already in fuel-guzzling vehicles and we’re now moving them into EV vehicles at a very low cost of switching,” he said. “The result of rising prices has actually led to a very high demand for our product.”

Uber currently has more than 6,000 electric vehicles on its app in London, the most of any city and equal to 13% of all its cars there.

826,3 EV Stocks to Buy Now at a Discount,"The more than decade-long surge in certain EV stocks has made this sector an attractive one for long-term growth investors. Electric vehicles are here to stay. Accordingly, those looking for long-term growth may constantly be on the lookout for deals in this space.

Unfortunately, in recent years, few deals could be had. Valuation expansion in this space led to skyrocketing market capitalizations across the sector. Those who wanted high-growth exposure had to pay up for it.

However, with the macro environment having taking a hard shift of late, there are bargains to be had. Valuations have been compressed, due largely to higher interest rates. In a bid to quash inflation, the Federal Reserve has kept its foot on the gas pedal, raising rates consistently this year.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Perhaps valuations can continued to be compressed, leading to further downside. That’s always possible. But at some point, even the most beaten-down stocks start to look attractive.

Here are three top EV stocks I think are worth a look, especially on any further pressure moving forward.

TSLA Tesla  $275.61 NIO Nio  $19.91 XPEV Xpeng  $18.52

Top EV Stocks to Buy: Tesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Gigafactory Texas

The most prominent EV stock in the market by far is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). This company is one of the global leaders in the production of electric vehicles here in the U.S.

While I’ve been critical of Tesla in the past (and still think this stock is probably overvalued to some extent), on a potential significant pullback in the future, TSLA stock could be one to keep an eye on.

Tesla’s margins, particularly for the auto sector, have been incredible. Leveraging the company’s driver assistance technology (it’s not full self-driving yet), Tesla has been able to post margins of around 25% in the past. With the auto sector remaining red-hot, demand for Teslas has been through the roof. Many expect this to continue, as the race to own an EV heats up.

Story continues

Over the long-term, investors taking the view that Tesla can maintain its market share may be right in their assessment this stock has further to run.

Tesla’s latest stock split went through on Wednesday, making this company even cheaper to own, on a per-share basis, for retail investors. Accordingly, TSLA stock remains one of the easiest proxies for growth in the EV sector and is likely to remain so at least over the medium-term.

A China-based EV manufacturer, Nio (NYSE:NIO) doesn’t necessarily get the same recognition as its U.S. counterparts. That said, this company is a fast-growing player in a high-growth Chinese market worth considering.

Shanghai-based EV maker Nio saw its shares soar to an all-time high of more than $60 in January of last year. However, since then, shares have collapsed to the $18 level at the time of writing.

This discount is notable, considering Nio’s growth potential relative to its peers. Its current valuation multiple seems onerous based on its historical sales, but for those who think Nio could be the “Chinese Tesla,” there’s actually a lot to like.

Nio has been busy announcing several new models. The company’s ET5 midsize sedan and EF9 minivan have intrigued investors. Additionally, the company’s network of battery-swap stations which replace a traditional charging network is something that distinguishes Nio from Tesla.

I think Nio is one of the best high-growth picks in this sector, trading at a significant discount to its peak right now.

Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) focuses on designing smart vehicles for East Asian markets. The company’s lineup includes sport sedans, family sedans and SUVs.

In addition to its impressive lineup of vehicles, Xpeng also has focused on providing infrastructure supporting this sector. A network of charging facilities and other services tied to its vehicles make Xpeng stand out from the competition.

Currently, the company produces and sells three cars – the P5 sedan, the P7 sedan and the G3i SUV. These vehicles have seen solid growth over time, boosted somewhat by Chinese government subsidies. Accordingly, Xpeng has become one of the fastest-growing China-based EV manufacturers.

In July, Xpeng posted monthly deliveries of 11,524 EVs – an increase of 43% year-on-year. China-based consumers are eagerly waiting for the official launch of Xpeng’s new G9 luxury SUV, which will likely take place in September.

I think Xpeng represents an intriguing speculative bet on growth in a fast-growing market that has only started to take off.

The stock market has not been an efficient money-making vehicle in the past few months, especially not for amateur investors who have been rocked by the sudden demise of growth offerings as inflation heats up and interest rates rise, creating a value-oriented marketplace. Even hedge funds have not been immune to this crisis. Latest data from the capital markets firm Preqin suggests that 2022 has been the worst year on record in the past decade for funds that actively buy and sell stocks.

Per the capital markets firm, the cumulative returns of funds that buy and sell stocks have nosedived by over 12% in the last year. The year-to-date cumulative returns for 2022 paint a bleak picture as well and are down more than 11% as of the end of July. The drop comes from the sharpest decline in the benchmark S&P 500 in more than a decade. Even famous stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) are feeling the heat of this economic slowdown.

The most common strategy that hedge fund managers use to make money for clients is buying and selling stocks. It is unlikely this is going to change any time soon, despite recession fears holding investors hostage. However, the economic crisis has created increased impetus for hedge fund managers to invest in cheaper stocks that offer the same growth potential as their more expensive counterparts but come with lower risk money-wise. These funds are thus buying up shares of firms trading at below $50 per share with strong growth catalysts.

Our Methodology

The companies that are priced under $50 per share, as of September 1, and enjoy popularity among hedge funds were selected for the list. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19

Brookfield’s development pipeline stands at 18,000 MWs, providing confidence the company can meet its targeted double- digit cash flow growth through to 2025. The market narrative around the energy transition and energy security, along with increasing fossil fuels prices which have driven greater focus on switching to renewables, helped Brookfield shares in the quarter.”

Fertility is an important benefit for companies that are looking to attract and retain women and other underrepresented talent who are focused on family building, and we believe a benefit that companies will increasingly invest in as they lean into their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.”

7. Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE:UNVR)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33

Share Price as of September 1: $25.22

Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE:UNVR) markets commodity and specialty chemical products. In mid-July, the company announced that it was expanding a pact with Calumet Specialty Products for the distribution of naphthenic and paraffinic base oils, packed and bulk, throughout Europe. Under the terms of the deal, Univar customers would have access to a broader range of Calumet products in the region.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Lyrical Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE:UNVR), with 5.4 million shares worth more than $135 million.

In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Rhizome Partners highlighted a few stocks and Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE:UNVR) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE:UNVR) recently sold off about 25% and is now trading at 9-10 times its 2022 price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiple with a little over 2 times net debt/EBITDA. Univar, Brenntag, Tricon, IMCD, Helm, and Azelis are the largest chemical distributors in a fragmented industry. Like many distribution businesses, route density is critically important. A truck that can make multiple stops on a route will have structural advantages over its smaller competitors. Univar Solutions Inc. (NYSE:UNVR) has dense routes in North America, its key market. This unique advantage tends to compound over time. Traditionally, chemical distribution is a “pick up the phone and call your sale representative” business. Around the world, there are different degrees of digital penetration in the sales process, with Asia at the leading edge of technology adoption. Univar Solutions and Brenntag are the two leaders that have invested heavily in technology and e-commerce solutions for their customers. Smaller mom-and-pop operators lack the financial and human resources to invest in technology solutions. On the other hand, a purely digital marketplace for purchasing chemicals often struggles to gain critical transaction volume because of the lack of logistics and fulfillment capabilities. Customers can place their orders, but they cannot receive the orders in reasonable time. Dense routes consisting of warehouses and trucks located under 60 minutes driving distance are the “atoms” that prevent “bits” players from attacking the chemical-distribution business.”

6. Vontier Corporation (NYSE:VNT)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33

Share Price as of September 1: $21.92

Vontier Corporation (NYSE:VNT) markets electronic equipment and instruments.

The revenue over the period was $776 million, up 7% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and beating estimates by $13 million. The firm declared a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share on August 8, in line with previous. The forward yield was 0.41%.

On July 8, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell maintained an Overweight rating on Vontier Corporation (NYSE:VNT) stock and lowered the price target to $33 from $39, noting that the demand was continuing to soften for the firm.

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Royce & Associates is a leading shareholder in Vontier Corporation (NYSE:VNT), with 2.8 million shares worth more than $65 million.

Along with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Vontier Corporation (NYSE:VNT) is one of the stocks on the radar of elite investors.

In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Argosy Investors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Vontier Corporation (NYSE:VNT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Vontier Corporation (NYSE:VNT) is an industrial business focused on mobility with large exposure to retail gas stations and the automotive aftermarket. Trading at 9x estimated 2023E cash flows, VNT is priced for terminal declines in cash flow due to its exposure to internal combustion engines (ICE). Meanwhile, I believe Vontier is successfully pivoting its business towards higher-growth market segments, evidenced by its acquisition of DRB Systems, a point-of-sale (POS) and operating system used by car washes. In more recent comments, VNT has doubled down on its interest in the car wash space, so we expect to see additional investments here. There is a very successful example in Sonny’s, a vertically integrated provider of equipment, service, POS, training, consulting, etc. that has existed in private markets for years. This very well could be a model that DRB, under VNT’s control, attempts to emulate. Given the mission-criticality of these systems to car wash operators, and their small cost relative to total car wash revenues, there is significant pricing power for operators like DRB and Sonny’s. I believe that investors are overly and unnecessarily skeptical of the capital allocation decisions happening at Vontier Corporation (NYSE:VNT), but we believe recent repurchases reflect management confidence in the long-term of the business and appear to be opportunistic based on the business’ attractive valuation.”

829,Twitter Launches an Edit Button for Paying Subscribers,"(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. is launching an edit button for the first time, after years of debate both internally and externally as to whether such a feature was a good idea for a product known for making posts go viral.

The edit feature will soon be available to users who pay $4.99 per month for a subscription to Twitter Blue. Edit Tweet, as the feature will be called, will let users make changes to their tweet for up to 30 minutes after it’s originally published. Tweets that are edited will carry a label, and others on Twitter will be able to click on the label to see prior versions of the post.

The company is specifically testing the edit button with a small group of users in hopes of quickly resolving possible issues, the company wrote in a blog post. The edit button will then roll out to Twitter Blue users in the coming weeks.

Twitter has debated the pros and cons of an edit button for years, with some worried that it will be abused by people hoping to go viral, only to change the content of a message after it’s been retweeted. Former CEO Jack Dorsey said as recently as January 2020 that an edit button was highly unlikely, but it was so widely requested that the company never made a definitive call on whether it would launch something.

That debate snowballed earlier this year when Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk took a large ownership stake in the company, then polled his followers on whether they wanted an edit button. The majority of those who voted said yes. Twitter quickly confirmed it was already testing the feature internally, and in an apparent effort to distance the project from Musk’s influence, clarified that it started work on an edit button before Musk’s poll.

High energy prices and global warming have shifted the focus of governments all over the globe towards sustainable energy. On this front, the largest and most developed economies in the world have started to provide incentives to both customers and companies to acquire and develop alternative energy products that are environmentally friendly.

One such category of products is solar panels, which provide users with the ability to harness the energy of the Sun and use it as electricity. Industry outlooks for this segment are bright, especially at a time when the world was once again reminded of its dependence on crude oil when prices skyrocketed in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

This market is one of the most valuable ones that you will come across, and nearly every research report that we have analyzed estimates that the value of this segment will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Starting from Fortune Business Insights, the research firm estimated that the solar market was worth $170 billion in 2020 and that it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 6.9% to reach $293 billion as 2028 ends.

Another report from Allied Markets Research, which narrows down the solar market to focus on photovoltaic and solar power systems estimates that these segments were worth $52 billion in 2018 and will grow at a strong 20.5% CAGR to sit at $223 billion by 2025 end. Fortune Business Insights also narrows its focus down on the global photovoltaic market and in a report that was released in April 2022, the research firm has astounding estimates for this industry.

In its report, the firm outlines that this particular market had a value of $154 billion in 2020 and that it will grow at a 25.9% CAGR to be worth a staggering $1 trillion as 2028 ends. The research firm ascribes this growth to the strong demand for electricity and the rising use of fossil fuels - both of which will nudge customers to try out other technologies to diversify their energy sources. It adds that Asia Pacific will account for the bulk of this estimated impressive growth.

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: All right, let's take a look at some of the major averages as we kick off this, the 10:00 AM hour on this, the first trading session of September 2022. Dow Jones Industrial average right now, that is moving lower by about 150-ish points, about half in a percent the red. NASDAQ composite, the tech heavy average, you're also seeing that down at this point, just about 30 minutes into trade, it's down by about 1.1%. And then additionally, the S&P 500 down by about 3/4 of a percent.

Let's get a quick look in on some of the sector activity that we're seeing here on the day as well here. You've got more decliners than advancers overall. We mentioned the S&P 500 lower. Utilities, one of the bright spots, that's up by about half a percent right now. But then you've got a lot of red here on the screen that we're going to continue to track across the sectors.

Once again, you've got about nine out of 11 S&P 500 sectors in negative territory. It's energy that's actually the biggest decliner here on the day. That's down by about 3%.

Also just want to take a quick look at some of the meme names that we've been tracking on the day, as well, as we were breaking down where some of those movements are taking place. Palantir, Coinbase, Coinbase down by about 5 and 1/2 percent. And then additionally, you've got some of the other names like a Robinhood, that's down by about 4%.

And then just lastly to round this out, I wanted to take a look at some of the EV names, especially as we've been tracking the news from NIO out of China. And what this gives us is the inclination to actually look into where some of the production and deliveries could move forward within a very critical region for all of the automakers to get electric vehicles right here.

And so you're seeing some wide and broad sector EV declines here on the day. Tesla is down by about 1.3% there as you're taking a look at that intraday chart. You've got NIO, as we mentioned, down by about 6.8%. GM, General Motors, that's down 1 and 1/2 percent. And Rivian, that's down by about 4% right now.",2022-09-01T14:19:14+00:00,2022-09-01

Video Transcript

[MUSIC PLAYING]

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So Catholics have the Vatican, soccer fans Old Trafford and Manchester, and for car guys like me, Jay Leno's Garage. Jay, thanks again for bringing us back.

JAY LENO: I was wondering where that was going, Catholics have the Vatican. I go, oh, boy, this is totally different. I am in the wrong-- oh, I see. But I see, you're making a comparison.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, you know.

JAY LENO: That's why you let people finish what they're saying. OK.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, I try. I try. So anyway, thanks again for having us here--

JAY LENO: Sure.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --on hallowed ground, if you will.

JAY LENO: Well, not really. I mean, it's a garage. And everything here runs and rolls, explodes, makes noise. I mean, that's sort of the fun thing. I didn't set out to have a collection. I just never sold anything. And some of the cars are very valuable. But some are just cars I like, Corvairs, Ford Falcons, cars I grew up with type of thing.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And the collection runs the gamut of older classic cars and newer performance cars.

JAY LENO: Yeah, there's no theme to this. I hate when people only have red cars or something like that. It's just I guess the theme would be anything of historical or technical importance, anything that was a noble failure, the double steam car. Even the Corvair was not considered successful. But they sold 1.8 million. Imagine, you sell 1.8 million of anything now, they make you president of the company. But in the '60s the Mustang sold 3 million. 1.8 million, what is that? I mean, it's almost funny by comparison.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: That kind of shocks me because knowing that now the reputation of the Corvair has been kind of a car that was a lemon in some sense.

Story continues

JAY LENO: But not. The Corvair was a very innovative automobile. I think it's one of the greatest American designs of all time. When you look at a '66 Cosa now, I'll take it to a show, and people go is this a car Karmann Ghia? Is this European? Is this some kind of Abarth? No. They never heard of a Corvair.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, I've only heard of it because of this sort of the big fascination in classic cars of these days. The market is sort of really kind of exploding. And we just had Monterey Car Week wrap up. Haggerty said there was $470 million in sales at the auctions this year, blowing away 2015's record year. What do you think is going on in the classic cars?

JAY LENO: When money goes down, art, automobiles, collectible guns, things go up. People put their money into something more tangible. Well, if I'm going to lose my shirt, I might as well enjoy doing it. So instead of putting it in a 401(k) or something, I'll buy something I can use and enjoy, and hopefully it goes up in value.

I mean, this is fairly recent in the sense of 25 years or 30. When I was a kid, my dad was always amazed that somebody would pay more for an old car than a new car. My dad, we'd get a new Cadillac. Why would you buy a 30-year-old car? You got a brand new Cadillac. I mean, it made no sense to him. He just didn't get it. And it was just a different time.

And it's only-- I mean, my brother bought a Porsche Speedster, a '58 Porsche Speedster for $800, I think, in '68, fixed it up, sold for $1,200, my father, oh my God, get it out of here. Get the money. My dad couldn't believe made $400 profit. And most recently, a friend of mine-- well, this is a while ago too, 20 years almost. He bought an F1 McLaren for $800,000 or $900,000.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: That's it?

JAY LENO: Well, this is when it was new.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Oh, when it's new.

JAY LENO: And within a few years, he got an offer for $1.3 million. And he loved the car, but he said, I'm never going to see that kind of profit again. And he sold it. And of course now they're worth $20 million. So this idea of cars as investments is fairly new. I mean, to me, I don't look at it as investments because I would sell my home first. Everything else would go first. So the idea that it's worth a lot, well, it's very nice, and it makes you look smart.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I think for a lot of fans, and you can speak to this, is that a lot of people are coming in as the investment people come in. And it sort of makes it more unaffordable for people who really like cars to get into that market. Is that sort of a thing that you're seeing?

JAY LENO: Well, there's an upside and a downside to both of those. The upside is, as cars become more valuable, people who make parts to fix that vehicle say, hey, this could be a worthwhile endeavor. Mechanics who repair those vehicles can make a living. I mean, there's a college called McPherson College in Kansas, and they give a four-year degree in automobile restoration.

This is the only country in the world where to be a mechanic, just say, I'm a mechanic. There's a garage here in Burbank that has my favorite sign. It says, we specialize in all makes of cars. Well, how can you specialize in everything? It just sort of makes-- you go to Germany, and you have to have a degree. You have a paper that certifies that you are a trained mechanic, you went to work on car. Well, here, you just go, I'm a mechanic. He said he was a mechanic. And you're a mechanic.

So there are kids that come out of McPherson College, and they start at 100 bucks an hour. You go to the Classic Center in Germany, or a lot of the heritage auto makers now have classic centers where they make parts available for their older cars. And it's like restoring the old masters, paintings, and things of that nature. So that's the upside to it.

I remember when you could buy DB5 Aston Martins for $2,500. I mean, they were just another old car, and then the James Bond phenomenon and all of that, and then it just hit the roof. And now they're $1.3 million, $1.5 million. But more are being saved. Cars that would have been thrown away as parts cars and now being taken back and restored.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So there is a flip side to that enthusiasm.

JAY LENO: Yeah. I think that's OK. I mean, the idea is to get on the market before everybody else does to try and figure out what a modern collectible will be. Like for example, to me, a modern collectible would be a first generation Miata, easy to work on, no airbag, no crazy electronics, a little bit of electronics, not much, but just simple, fun to drive, nice to look at, clean design. That would be an example.

The Taurus SHO from the late '80s, that front wheel drive, that Yamaha V6 engine, very powerful, very fast. The idea is to try and-- if you're knowledgeable about automobiles and you like cars, whatever you like will probably go up in value because other people will like it too. So you try to keep ahead of the market.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I know you're a big EV evangelist. You own a Tesla for many years. And you have the Plaid now for a while. Elon Musk just said that they sold their 3 millionth car about a month ago. Do you think anyone can catch up with Tesla and Musk right now? Or are they sort in the driver's seat when it comes to EVs?

JAY LENO: Well, the thing you have to realize about Elon, which is very clever, he came to this garage in 2007 with his prototype, the Roadster and that early one had a two speed transmission and a couple of other things involved. And I remember sitting, and he was telling me about, and he said, well, what I want to do is build charging stations all up and down the coast. And I'm going, OK, that'll happen, like, oh, that sounds good.

But he started building the infrastructure almost at the exact time he started building the car. So when the car debuted, you could drive LA to San Francisco. And now you can go anywhere in the country. I mean, you see a lot of other automakers get into the EV market, oh, you can charge it anywhere. You can't, really. You might. But it's 1:10. You're going to be here 18 hours, and you know.

So I think he should get a certain amount of credit for leading the charge because before Elon, oh, it's a golf cart. People would joke about electric, oh, they're slow and whatever it might be. So I give him a lot of credit for it. I mean, I think the EV will be the savior of the classic car industry.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Really?

JAY LENO: Yeah, because much like the automobile was the savior of the American horse, in 1900 in New York City, 60 tons of manure was dropped in the street every day. I mean, people got dysentery. And hot weather horses, like a junk man's horse, would drop dead in the street. They'd cut the reins and leave the carcass, and the thing would rot.

And people get-- and all of a sudden, Henry Ford comes along with the Model T and blows little puff of blue smoke in your face. Oh, I'll take blue smoke over manure any day. So that was, oh, OK. So now horses are primarily for recreation. And there are more horses now than there were in the mid-1800s because people use them for enjoyment, and beauty, and they take care of them.

And that's the same thing with cars. You'll use your EV to sit on the 405-- I mean, sitting on the 405 Freeway in a 426 Hemi getting eight miles to the gallon, it makes no sense at all. So you drive your EV. Then on the weekends, OK, you take your Hemi, you go to the car show, you go to Bob's Big-- boy whatever it might be.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, especially a steam-powered car on the 405, not the best option.

JAY LENO: Right, right.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So you mentioned Ford. I wanted to talk to you about that. Jim Farley. I spoke to him at Monterey, and he's a big car guy. He's racing cars at Laguna Seca. He also split the business into two units to capitalize on we need to move fast with EVs.

JAY LENO: That's why I'm very proud of American manufacturing. Everybody in Ford, GM, Dodge, they're all engineers now. In the old days, this is Bob from Admiral Washing Machines. He's going to help us with the marketing of this, and--

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Maytag.

JAY LENO: Yeah, Maytag. I mean, that's what they did. They brought marketing people in, and they put go fast stripes on it, like a like a Ferrari. It's got a stripe on the hood, just like a Ferrari. But now, you've got Royce, the President of GM. He's at Nurburgring setting records with Cadillac. I mean, it's very funny.

But you have real engineers. The businesses are lean. How they build a Corvette for $65,000, I have no idea. I mean, I could barely paint one and restore one for that. So the fact that it's done in a union shop and it's using high grade, a lot of magnesium, a lot of aluminum. It's not steel and torque converter transmissions. It's dual clutches. I mean, I'm really quite proud of American manufacturing. They've done an amazing job.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: That Corvette, when I first saw it and drove in it, it reminded me of the McLaren, for, like you said, a third of the price.

JAY LENO: For a third of the price.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And it kind of brings you back to you got Mary Barra GM. You have Jim Farley at Ford. Do you think either one of those is sort of the next level of-- for EV kind of hierarchy, you got Tesla. Do you think it's Ford or GM that'll be the next level in terms of that kind of competition?

JAY LENO: Well, I think America itself has always been about egalitarianism, making it available to everybody. The smart thing about America was anybody could buy a Model T. The idea in Germany or France of the average person owning an automobile, [CHUCKLES] I mean, it just seemed ridiculous.

But to make something affordable, to me, the greatest book ever written is still Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" because it was popular. It was accessible. It was the first time you could improve your life without having to die first or go to heaven and come back. You could just change your life, just by being a nice person.

And this was a concept that people just thought was unbelievable when it came out, that this rich man helps this poor man, and both their lives are improved. How simple could it be? And that's what it is. America was never about building premium automobiles. It was about building working classes, as they used to call it. I mean, of course, we build premium automobiles now. But I mean, I think that's the key. It's volume, really, is what it does.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, it seems like these days with such skyrocketing new car prices, the blue collar, mainstream kind of guy is buying used cars to survive. But I wanted to talk to you about that, about affordability, and again, Ford, real quick about that the new F-150 Lightning, an electric truck that is promising to come in at a competitive price point. I drove it. I think it's a great truck.

JAY LENO: You know, it's amazing. You can weld in the truck. It's got 240 in the back.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, so do you think that your guy who works at a worksite, construction worker, really professional kind of tradesmen, are they going to go hop on board the F-150 Lightning--

JAY LENO: Yes.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --and say, you know what? This is what I want.

JAY LENO: Yes. You know why I know that? Because in the '50s, trucks had a bench seat, 3-speed on the column, and a six-cylinder engine. Air conditioning in a truck? What are you, Mr-- are the owner of the factory? Look at this guy. I mean, you weren't a man. You know, trucks were manly things. And then all of a sudden, you have air.

I mean, an F-150 is basically a Lincoln. It's comfortable, you can do everything with it. The funny thing about it, the government's really responsible for that because I think back in the '80s, they put a 5% luxury tax on any vehicle more than $30,000. That was the deal. Anything above $30,000 was considered luxury car, so you paid 5% tax, so manufacturer. But you didn't pay it on trucks.

So then they said-- they came out with something. It was not a success, but it was a trendsetter, the Lincoln Blackwood. This was a luxury truck. And the 5% of the purchase price that you saved in tax you put it into leather interior, standard air conditioning, electric windows. And then suddenly, oh, then you got real value for your money. You could get a truck with all this stuff in it for less money than the equivalent luxury car.

So yeah, so it was really the government with that 5%, that's what spurred people to-- we're very clever here in America. We don't change our habits. You just find ways to get around them. Like, I was never a Hummer guy. I thought they were big, noisy, dirty, rolling coal, all that kind of stuff. So rather than eliminate it, we just make an electric one, a little smaller, a little lighter.

And you know, it's an amazing-- it's a great vehicle. I'm stunned at how good it is. I mean, that always sort of makes me laugh, the way we figure out ways to-- I want to eat cake every day, but I still want to be an athlete. All right, well, let's come up with some kind of cake, instead of eliminating it. Or smoking, people smoke. Let's vape. That's not-- it's stupid. Yeah.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: We'll always come up with different ways to spend our money and have fun. You know, speaking of that, we talked about EVs and stuff. And President Biden signing the Inflation Reduction Act, we won't get into the naming of that, but another extension of that tax credit for EVs. So is that-- like you said, a tax rate for trucks spurred that growth. Are we going to see more EV adoption with that?

JAY LENO: Oh, sure, I mean, it took 75 years for every American home to have a telephone. It took five years for every American home to have a computer. So I think using that same sort of thing, you see how quickly it's moving now. I mean, suddenly people who would never consider an EV, there's the psychological thing of seeing $6.98 a-- what? You see, they go past that gas station sign.

Although the EV is not free, it just kind of seems like it's free because it's not $7 a gallon, $5.95. It's not thrown in your face every time you go-- it costs $100 to fill this car up. You sort of plug it in. The next day you magically have, quote, a full tank, and oh, OK.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: No more gas stations, no more weird smelling hands.

JAY LENO: Exactly.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I want to also talk about what you're up to these days and the seventh season of ""Jay Leno's Garage"" is going to come out. And first of all, did you ever think this show would go seven seasons? And can you tell us what we can see, what we can expect coming up in the new season?

JAY LENO: I was just down at SpaceX with Elon, and that's fascinating. You know what's so funny, everybody seems normal until you realize, this guy is like a genius guy. We're down there, and he's got this plan to put send 1,000-- he's building 1,000 rockets to go to Mars. It sounds like some crazy pipe dream.

But then you go there and you see hundreds of these jet engines lined up, and you go, he's really going to do this. And the fact that as he's talking to me, scientists and physicists are coming over, going, oh, yeah, yeah. And he understands manufacturing.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: In addition to the rocket science, right?

JAY LENO: Yeah I mean, he understands. It's like Elon says right now, it would cost over $1 billion to put one gallon of water on Mars. He wants to get that down to $100,000 a gallon, which is still crazy, but it's not $1 billion. And so just that thinking outside the box thing, which I find uniquely American, that's why I never got this-- I always felt bad with this banning of immigrants thing that they had a few years ago, with shutting the-- Steve Jobs was Syrian.

I mean, all the doctors, all the people that come from India-- you know, America will seduce you with hamburgers and hot dogs and music. My favorite example is we used to do this Jaywalking thing where we'd knock on doors and ask people questions. I remember going to one house, knocking on the door, and the grandfather answered the door. And he's got a vest and a tie. And he speaks Spanish. He goes, no English.

His son comes over, a little fatter than his dad, a little heavier, kind of sloppy. He speaks English, talks to me, so and so. Then I meet his son. He's got a T-shirt with some obscenity on it, just the deterioration.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: The progression of it.

JAY LENO: The progression of downhill. You can see the grandfather is the fittest one in the family because he's the immigrant. He came. He worked hard. And everybody else is profiting off, and that's what America is about. You bring these immigrants in, and they invent stuff, and they and they become citizens. It's a great place to live. The pizza is great. The music's fun. The girls are beautiful. That's what happens. You need new immigrants all the time.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, I visited with the Zinger guys the other day. And I know they're coming up on your show too.

JAY LENO: Yeah, right, right.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Father and son team. I mean, great story there, American manufacturing again. And so I guess this season, you're going to be highlighting a lot of these kinds of things.

JAY LENO: We highlight them. We have them on the show. We have Elon. I'm shooting this week with President Biden. We're doing--

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Oh, wow.

JAY LENO: Yeah, he's a car guy. He's still got his--

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: He has a Corvette, right?

JAY LENO: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we're going to have some fun and take some EVs out and talk about that. Yeah, it's a great show to do. The idea is everybody has some connection with the car. I talk to celebrities all the time, and they go, I know nothing about cars.

I said, well, did you ever do anything with the car with your dad? Oh, when I was a kid, my dad had a Cadillac, and we'd go for ice cream every Sunday. You get a Cadillac, get a celebrity, go for ice cream on a Sunday and talk about it. And then that's pretty much it. I mean, the car is a huge part, I think, of American culture.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Lastly, Jay, I know that you also have various other business interests. And one thing I discovered was have a business where you-- all these cars here are detailed and cleaned with a specific product.

JAY LENO: Well, we developed our own product. I mean, the smart way to do it is a big company comes along, like 3M or something, gives you a huge check, and you hold up-- well, this is the best-- we developed our own stuff here. We quietly put it out, just to see how people reacted to it.

We got a great reaction. People liked it. People ordered and then reordered. And now we're national. We're in Walmart and a bunch of these big stores. I expect the usual snarkiness. Jay Leno, you got to-- you're trying to cash in on the-- OK, maybe. But it's a good product. People seem to like it. And it's doing well, so keep our fingers crossed.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, I heard you have your own chemistry. It's not just something you put your label on.

JAY LENO: No, no, we developed everything here at the shop. We try it out on all of my stuff. And it seems pretty good. I mean, the one that got us started was cars don't have chrome anymore, none to speak. Of polishes-- and I would use other polishes, and I noticed on the rag, I'd see metallic specks. It's actually peeling off a layer of the chrome. So I said, let's find a company and develop a chemical that cleans without having an abrasive. And that's what we did. That's the one the first took off. And then we built the whole company around that.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So we'll see these products in Walmart now, big deal coming up and seventh season of the show coming up later this month. So Jay, thanks again for joining us.

JAY LENO: Thanks, appreciate it.

840,Uber and Lyft Drivers in New York Struggle With City’s EV-Charging Divide,"(Bloomberg) -- Manhattan's abundance of electric-car chargers is a boon for the burgeoning number of Tesla drivers in New York's wealthiest borough. But for the vast majority of ride-share drivers who live elsewhere in the Big Apple, that network is largely out of reach.

This EV-charging divide poses a challenge for ride-hailing leaders Uber and Lyft, which need more drivers behind the wheels of electric vehicles to meet their lofty emissions-reduction goals.

Bronx-based Mohammed Islam, 44, typically spends about 30 minutes and roughly $40 to charge his Tesla Model Y SUV inside the parking garage of the Bay Plaza Shopping Center before starting a shift for Uber. It’s a short drive from his home and one of the only public fast chargers in the borough that can power an electric car battery to 80% in half an hour. If it’s too crowded or the chargers don’t work, the closest option is a lower-voltage facility a mile away, where an equivalent charge would take almost eight hours.

“I get there early to avoid the lines but I’m always a little worried,” he said. “Maybe it’s not gas but there’s still a price, one way or the other. When I’m charging, I’m not picking people up.”

Manhattan is New York’s richest borough and has by far the most chargers, according to the Department of Transportation. However, most Uber and Lyft drivers live in the outer boroughs. At 40%, Queens has the highest concentration of ride-share drivers in the city, according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission, yet has only 16% of the city’s over 1,900 public chargers.

The range anxiety that can plague any EV owner is especially acute for these ride-share drivers in New York, where most count on driving as a full-time job. For them, the unequal distribution of chargers directly affects their take-home pay. It’s also a problem for their platforms. Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. both pledged to electrify fleets in North America by 2030 and have ramped up incentives and perks to entice drivers to trade in gas guzzlers for an EV. Their goals are colliding with a charging system that was made to serve wealthy customers and not working-class members of the gig economy.

Story continues

It’s an uphill climb for the San Francisco-based apps. Only 1% of the 71,500 ride-share vehicles in New York are electric, according to the TLC. That’s slightly better than at the national level, according to clean-energy research firm BloombergNEF. Uber is doing better in Europe, where government incentives have helped spur the switch to EVs.

Uber has 26,000 EVs active on the platform and plans to spend $800 million in incentives, charging discounts and other benefits to help drivers make the switch to an electric vehicle. In London it's taking steps to get more EVs on the streets by partnering with fintech Moove, which uses an alternative underwriting model to make it easier for gig workers to get a vehicle.

Uber also recently created a new role — head of charging infrastructure — dedicated to working with car manufacturers, charging companies and others to expand access for drivers.

“For Uber to be successful in the EV transition, we need to make investment go into places where drivers are concentrated,” said Chris Hook, who leads global sustainability strategy at Uber. “It needs to be equitable.”

Queens-based Viraj Desai, 25, said he isn't willing to trade the certainty his Toyota Camry provides for his Uber shifts, even if it comes with a high gas bill.

""I would never switch to an EV. I've seen too many people wasting their time charging,"" he said. ""I need to know I can work. I can't afford to be offline.""

For their part, cities should prioritize building public chargers in lower income neighborhoods, Hook said. Uber is working with lawmakers in key cities including London and Paris by sharing data on driving patterns like trip durations, pickups and destinations. It’s also helping drum up interest from car-charging companies that are skeptical of the commercial benefits of rollouts in lower income areas where, on the whole, EV adoption is still nascent.

Lyft said its EV rental program and partnerships with charging providers like EVgo and Electrify America have helped boost the number of EVs on its platform by 22% compared with last year. Still, “there’s a very big role for the public side to fill in order to address charging equity, and ride-share can be a powerful partner,” Paul Augustine, Lyft’s director of sustainability, said in an interview. In May, the company wrote to New York Governor Kathy Hochul to stress the importance of increasing funding to charging access for low-income and disadvantaged communities.

“The buck stops with all of us,” Augustine said. “We need to set the right market conditions where it’s a no-brainer for drivers to make the switch.”

New York’s lawmakers have goals of their own: the Department of Transportation plans to install 10,000 curbside chargers across all five boroughs and equip 40% of parking spots in municipal lots with fast chargers by 2030. Spokesman Vin Barone said more than 85% of curbside chargers installed by the city are in the outer boroughs.

“Equity is a guiding principle as this administration works to expand access to electric vehicle charging,” he said. “DOT will continue to work closely with the TLC on policy and infrastructure to support the transition to EVs among for-hire vehicle drivers and all drivers in the city.”

Uber has pledged to be zero-emissions globally by 2040 and Lyft, which only operates in North America, has targeted 2030. New York is one of their largest markets, so progress on electrification there is critical to reaching their climate goals.

Even under ambitious policy scenarios, the city still has a long way to go, according to Matthew Moniot, a researcher at the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Moniot led a May study on New York’s charging network and ride-hailing services that showed even if EVs made up only 30% of its ride-hailing fleet, the city would need to increase the current count of 68 fast-charging ports to over 1,000 to meet demand.

Expanding public charging alone won’t solve EV’s inequality problem, Moniot said. “It won’t be fully equitable until ride-share drivers are able to charge at home,” he said. New York’s ride-share EVs have to charge three times more frequently than personal cars because they build up mileage more quickly.

“The trick is finding ways to charge off-shift so they can dedicate time to making money,” he said.

845,7 Hot Small-Cap Stocks to Buy in September,"In general, finding small-cap stocks to buy can be somewhat fraught. These are stocks with market capitalizations between roughly $300 million and $2 billion. They also tend to be riskier than large-cap names.

Revenue and profits of small-cap stocks tend to be much lower than those of their large-cap peers, while the small caps’ debt-revenue ratios tend to be higher.

As a result, small-cap companies are more likely to go bankrupt, but there still are small-cap stocks to buy that can really run.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

It’s much easier to make huge profits with small-cap stocks than with large-cap ones, and history shows that the best small-cap stocks to buy can indeed make huge fortunes for investors.

For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) were once small-cap stocks.

And some professional money managers who believe in “momentum investing” would say that the best small-cap stocks to buy are those whose values have been climbing in recent weeks. That increases the chances of making a great deal of money in the market.

That said, consider these seven small-cap stocks to buy as we enter September.

Zynex (NASDAQ:ZYXI) sells its own medical devices and those of other companies. Many of the products that Zynex sells are pain-relievers.  Its leading product –NextWave — uses electrical currents to relieve pain.

Given increased fears of opioid addiction, the demand for Zynex’s pain-relieving products is likely to be very strong. The company’s orders reached record levels in Q2, as its orders increased 19% quarter over quarter and 10% year over year, and the company preliminarily reported that its sales had jumped 18% year over year in Q2.

For the full year, Zynex expects its EBITDA, excluding certain items, to come in between $25 million and $35 million. Zynex’s forward price-earnings ratio is a reasonable 21.5, making in one of the better small-cap stocks to buy right now.

As in the U.S., India is experiencing a huge travel rebound as fears of the coronavirus subside and as lockdowns are terminated.

Indian online travel agency Yatra Online (NASDAQ:YTRA) is clearly benefiting from that trend.

Yatra’s revenue jumped 141% year-over-year in the second quarter to $15.9 million, excluding certain items. Its adjusted EBITDA in Q2 came in at $1.6 million.

The shares are trading at a very attractive forward price-sales ratio of just 1.7 ($173 million market cap/$106 million analysts’ mean estimate for next year).

TSR (NASDAQ:TSRI) should be reporting very strong financial results in the current macro environment. The U.S. labor market remains tight while many IT companies are still generating huge profits. Those IT firms are more likely than in past years to use recruiters like TSR and to pay them high commissions.

For its fiscal Q4 that ended in May, TSR’s sales jumped 24% to a record $26.2 million, while its EPS came in at 15 cents, versus a per-share loss of 2 cents during the same period a year earlier. For the full fiscal year, TSR’s EPS jumped to $3.30, versus a per share loss of 31 cents during the previous year.

The stock has climbed 12% in the last three months, and its P/E ratio is a tiny 2.4. With the IT labor market likely to remain very tight for a long time, TSR stock is one of the better small-cap stocks worth considering.

In January, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to Aptorum’s (NASDAQ:APM) SACT-1 cancer treatment, as InvestorPlace writer Joel Baglole reported.

A recent clinical trial indicated that the drug does not adversely affect electrical currents in the heart. The Phase 1 clinical data also suggested that any QT interval after oral administration of SACT-1 at 150 mg was well within clinically acceptable limits.

Despite the recent slump of stocks, Aptorum has climbed 4% in August. Moreover, the shares have jumped 53% since May.

These gains indicate that the Street is very excited about SACT-1 . That, in turn, suggests that APT stock may continue to climb going further and that the drug could become a big moneymaker for the company. Indeed, orphan drugs are often very lucrative for pharmaceutical firms.

Rrecruiting company GEE (NYSE:JOB) focuses on placing skilled professionals in positions. In addition to IT workers, Gee also recruits across the white-collar spectrum.

Gee should continue to benefit from the tight labor market for some time, as more companies that have difficulty hiring skilled employees turn to recruiters.

In its fiscal Q3 that ended in June, Gee’s operating income came in at $3.2 million, up from $1.8 million during the same period a year earlier. And the firm’s revenue increased to $41.1 million from $38.1 million during the same period a year earlier.

In the last month, JOB stock has soared 30%, while its P/E ratio is a tiny 3.56 making it among the more attractive small-cap stocks out there.

vTv Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VTVT) has a diabetes treatment, TTP399, that’s getting a lot of attention.

In May, G42 Healthcare agreed to purchase $25 million of VTVT for about $2.41 per share, well above the stock’s current level of $1.

What’s more, last month, another investment company, CinPax, agreed to acquire $10 million in VTVT stock for $2.41 per share. CinRx also obtained a warrant to buy another 1.2 million shares for about 72 cents per share. The warrants will become exercisable upon agreed vesting triggers.

vTv intends to begin two Phase 3 studies of its drug next quarter. In the last three months, VTVT stock has shot up 47%.

Zinc8 (ZAIRF) energy stocks to buy: two light bulbs with grey sky in the background

Source: Shutterstock

Zinc8 (OTC:ZAIRF) is developing an energy storage system to store energy significantly longer than lithium-ion batteries and is much cheaper.

Based on Zinc8’s recently released Q2 earnings press release, it appears that the system met all of an unnamed cloud service provider’s requirements, including demonstrating discharges of 6+ hours.

It sounds as though Zinc8’s system passed its test with flying colors and that the cloud service provider remains quite interested in using the system.

Zinc8 is looking to build a factory in Ulster, N.Y. and has received support for that initiative from the Senate Majority Leader, Charles Schumer. Given Schumer’s support for the firm, I think it’s likely that Zinc8 will benefit from the Democrats’ climate bill.

ZAIRF stock has soared 50% in the last three months.

While assessing business growth, revenues are often more monitored than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.

Stable or declining sales growth indicates obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.

Without impressive revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the long term. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continuous bottom-line improvement usually requires robust sales growth.

Nonetheless, sales growth alone doesn’t indicate much about a company’s future performance. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.

Selecting the Winning Stocks

To shortlist stocks with impressive sales growth and a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.

But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. Hence, we have added other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.

P/S Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.

% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.

Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation.

Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means that the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screening:

Tesla’s expected sales growth rate for 2022 is 58.4%. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Based in Newtown, PA, EPAM Systems is well known for its software engineering and IT consulting services.

EPAM Systems’ sales are expected to jump 29.4% for 2022. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

850,Tesla stock price target raised to $360 by Piper Sandler,"Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss Piper Sandler Analyst Alexander Potter raising his price target on Tesla.

Video Transcript

[AUDIO LOGO]

BRAD SMITH: Guys, let's also take a look at Tesla here. Let's stay in the automotive landscape here. Automotive landscape says Piper Sandler-- Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter raises price target on the EV maker from $344 to $366-- or $360 now. Citing that while a price cut to Tesla's cars may signal a demand issue to some investors, it's actually a measure in helping the company address its backlog problems here.

Now, Piper Sandler has had a history of being one of the most vocal Tesler-- Tesla analysts out there. But here on the day, you're actually seeing Tesla shares holding up by about 8/10 of a percent right now, even with this rating that's come out.

And of course, this is a stock that just went through its own three-for-one stock split as well with Tesla. A little bit off of those levels from when it made the split. But pretty much every equity is off from that time period and that marker to this date right now.

BRIAN SOZZI: Well, here's some completely unscientific research, just like what I've been doing with Lululemon. I'm seeing these Tesla cars everywhere where I live. There has been an explosion on the highways, at least where I live, over the past year in Tesla's of all models. It is extremely noticeable. And I can't say I'm surprised. Hey, look, Tesla's put up a series of very strong quarters. And the way they do that, they just sell more cars.

BRAD SMITH: The most remarkable thing about that is that you see it without them marketing.

BRIAN SOZZI: Yes.

BRAD SMITH: They're not-- they're not marketing.

BRIAN SOZZI: Well, they are through Elon Musk's Twitter account.

BRAD SMITH: That's it.

BRIAN SOZZI: That's it.

BRAD SMITH: That is the only marketing mechanism. It's a company that doesn't have to worry about cutting back on its marketing expenses during an economic downturn because why? There aren't any to begin with.

Story continues

BRIAN SOZZI: And there aren't-- I don't think there's an investor relations team there.

BRAD SMITH: It's we have a website and we have Elon Musk's Twitter account, what more do you want? All right.

BRIAN SOZZI: And cool looking cars.",2022-09-02T13:54:03+00:00,2022-09-02
851,Rivian opens first service center on the East Coast,"Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports live from Rivian's first, newly opened service center on the East Coast on how the company plans to expand across the U.S. by 2023.

Video Transcript

[AUDIO LOGO]

Rivian has been a colossal disappointment since its 2021 IPO, with the stock down close to 60% from its IPO price. Nevertheless, we find our friend, Pras Subramanian, inside a Rivian service center. Pras, what are you learning?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Brian. So yeah, you know Rivian sort of trying to ramp up their deliveries, and their customer service, and servicing cars with-- with things like what's behind me. So the Brooklyn Rivian service center, one of 24 in the country that Rivian has to not only service vehicles, but also deliver these cars to certain clients.

And also within that, there's like a waiting area, kind of clubhouse lounge area for people to be there. But yeah, as we ramp up-- as they ramp up deliveries, they've had 8,000 cars produced so far this year. A big part of that is delivering those cars, so these service centers will be a big part of that story.

- Pras, just while we have you here, for Rivian, you know, how does this stack them up against some of the other names, Tesla especially, given the electric vehicle push that we're seeing right now. And customers latching on to that, the demand is ramping up. So how does the service center need to keep pace when you have a Rivian, versus a Tesla, versus a Ford service center, versus GM. The list goes on.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, with a lot of these EV companies, Brad, it's a lot of direct to consumer. They're not-- they're sort of eschewing the dealership model for their own direct-to-consumer ordering on the website. And they'll deliver the car to you, right. So these service centers are sort of fulfillment areas where the trucks come in from the factory, and then they deliver them to the individual clients across the Eastern seaboard here.

So that's a big difference between what traditional automakers are doing, and what Rivians and the Teslas of the world are doing. From a Tesla point of view, they have a lot more showrooms, right. They have a lot more places where they have retail operations, retail presence, and merchandising of the cars. You can walk in, see the car, see the different colors, and order something.

Story continues

This is a bit more different here. This is more of like, once you actually order the car, and it's here-- you're here, your order is fulfilled. It'll come here, or it'll be delivered to you and you'll have to come here if you want any kind of service done. So it's a very different model.

But I will say, they're opening more like retail hubs, they're calling. Like one in Venice, California, where you walk in, it has like a very kind of like a vibe like a WeWork maybe, like a kind of a cool place to hang out. This is an extension of the brand as to where they want to be as a high end, adventure type of brand. And they're kind of seeking people and clientele who have a similar ethos, if you will.

- Pras, you know who's got the vibe? The Rivian vibe? You. Love those glasses. Just love that look. Just-- you know what, you always impress me, my friend. Always impress me.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Thanks, Brian. I'm melting out here. I'm melting out here.

- Well, you look good while melting. Thanks so much for the update, our own Pras Subramanian out there, outside the Rivian service center. Appreciate it.",2022-09-02T14:48:51+00:00,2022-09-02
852,How the Twitter whistleblower deposition could alter merger case with Elon Musk,"A deposition scheduled for next week could significantly steer the outcome of Twitter’s (TWTR) trial-bound case to force Elon Musk to follow through on his $44 billion deal to acquire the social network.

Peiter Zatko, Twitter’s former cybersecurity chief turned company whistleblower, is scheduled to offer deposition testimony in the case on Friday.

Zatko, a respected hacker known as Mudge who was let go from his position at Twitter in January, upended Twitter’s fast-tracked Delaware lawsuit last week by filing a report that accused the company’s senior executives of illegally tolerating substandard cybersecurity and user account protocols. The report led Musk to invoke additional arguments for terminating the merger and request a delay to the trial, which is scheduled to begin on October 17.

In his report filed with U.S. regulators and made public last week in a redacted version published by The Washington Post, Zatko said he personally brought the alleged deficiencies to the attention of Twitter’s management team. If proven, that claim could provide Musk with a legally valid exit from the parties’ $44 billion merger agreement.

Yale Law School professor Yair Listokin said Zatko’s deposition testimony could bolster particular arguments set forth by Musk, depending on how much evidence he has to back up his claims.

“It has to make Twitter seem like a fraud and a scam in order for Musk to win,” Listokin said. “But if it's bad enough, it can change the case.” Elon Musk's twitter account is seen on a smartphone in front of the Twitter logo in this photo illustration taken, April 15, 2022.

Fraud allegations

Zatko alleges Twitter and certain senior executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, violated securities and trade laws by failing to address and fully notify the public of “egregious deficiencies” in user privacy, digital and physical security, platform integrity, and content moderation. Zatko said he raised the issues with the company’s executives in 2021.

Musk contends that if those claims are true, Twitter committed fraud by inducing him to rely on a merger agreement in which the company agreed that its 2022 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission were free of “material” omissions and untrue statements. Material information is the type of information that affects a party’s decisions in entering into a contract.

Story continues

In Musk's view, what Twitter held out in the merger agreement wasn’t true by Zatko’s version of events because the company omitted the full scope of Zatko’s concerns from its fiscal year 2021 10-K report filed on February 16, 2022.

Instead, Musk argues, Twitter reported a narrower version of the company’s privacy, data protection, safety, and cybersecurity concerns, saying that the issues could negatively affect growth and engagement of its monetizable daily active users or “mDAUs.” SpaceX Chief Engineer Elon Musk raises his phone during a joint news conference with T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert at the SpaceX Starbase, in Brownsville, Texas, U.S., August 25, 2022. REUTERS/Adrees Latif

Musk also made two other fraud claims: Twitter may have committed fraud by falsely stating in the same 10-K that it “strive[s] to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity” and by estimating in public filings that fewer than 5% of mDAUs on its platform are either spam or bot accounts.

If Zatko provides evidence to back up his statements that Twitter employed lax security measures while stating otherwise in its regulatory filings, the statement could amount to fraud, Listokin said.

“I think most people would think that it's a material, fraudulent statement,” Listokin explained. “Fraud is generally a good defense to a contract — almost any contract, even if the contract is written pretty precisely.”

Even if proof of fraud is found, Boston College Law School professor Brian Quinn noted that he still sees Musk's claims as invalid. Twitter’s 10-K, Quinn explains, acknowledges that the company did have some level of concern about data and cybersecurity.

“It seems to be large enough of an umbrella to capture Zatko’s whistleblower complaints,” Quinn said.

As for Musk’s contention that Twitter may be misrepresenting its spam and bot numbers, Quinn said Twitter has likely covered its bases because the company hedged its SEC statements concerning spam and bot accounts with language that leaned heavily on its “significant judgment.”

Additionally, Listokin notes that Musk could find it difficult to win on the argument that fake account numbers are material to his agreement to buy the company if Twitter can show that Musk always suspected Twitter’s projections were overstated.

Material adverse effect

Still, another one of Musk’s legal theories could get a boost from Zatko’s testimony, Peter Glennon, a contract litigation attorney, told Yahoo Finance.

In Musk’s July 8 termination letter, the Tesla chief contended that Twitter’s spam and bot accounting, if inaccurately reported in public filings, could trigger a “material adverse effect” or MAE — a legal standard that in extremely rare instances allows buyers to terminate a merger if the target's business operations are significantly altered.

“The MAE claims are pretty critical in my opinion,” Glennon said. “Now you have Zatko coming in and saying Twitter doesn’t know many accounts are fake because they’re not actually looking. They're not doing what they should be doing to reach a reliable estimate.""

Glennon explained that if Zatko has evidence that Twitter knew about and passively ignored a way to count fake users, Musk may have an MAE claim. That's because reports to investors containing false or misleading numbers could invalidate the $54.20 per share price that Musk agreed to pay.

“The whole business model is based on advertising and data collection,” Glennon said. “But if you don't know what percentage of the users are real versus fake, the value of that company will arguably be reduced. What Zatko says should be verifiable by other leading information technology experts.”

In a letter responding to Musk’s latest arguments, Twitter criticized Musk for tapping a third party’s unproven claims as justification for killing the deal. The social media company characterized Zatko’s report as “riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies” and lacking important context.

(Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)

“Contrary to the assertions in Mr. Musk’s letter, Twitter has breached none of its representations or obligations under the Agreement, and Twitter has not suffered and is not likely to suffer a Company Material Adverse Effect,” a spokesperson for Twitter wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance.

Attorneys Debra Katz and Alexis Ronickher, who are working on behalf of Zatko, noted that Zatko’s deposition testimony is involuntary and was solicited via subpoena by Musk’s attorneys.

“He did not make his whistleblower disclosures to the appropriate governmental bodies to benefit Musk or to harm Twitter, but rather to protect the American public and Twitter shareholders,” the attorneys said.

Zatko's deposition, now slated for September 9, is among dozens scheduled in the litigation. Though Zatko's stands out, Glennon said, for its potential to produce evidence either dispelling or backing Musk's claims.

853,"Tesla Stock May Slip, but an Analyst Sees a Buying Opportunity",Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter raised his price target on Tesla stock. He thinks shares could fall in coming weeks for three reasons.,2022-09-02T14:50:00+00:00,2022-09-02
854,"If Apple Builds a Car, People Would Buy, Survey Indicates.","The data hints that making a car might not be a bad idea, but it is far too early to seriously consider what it might mean for the company, or for the auto industry.",2022-09-02T16:19:00+00:00,2022-09-02
855,3 Auto Stocks to Buy for EV Growth,"Investors have quite the opportunity to get in on the growth of the auto industry as electric vehicle innovation continues. Specifically, the Zacks Automotive – Domestic Industry has posted a staggering total return of 240% over the last five years. In comparison, the S&P 500 return is 73% in that same time span.

The Automotive – Domestic Industry ranks in the top 36% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Out of this group, here are three stocks investors should consider buying.

General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Tesla (TSLA) are worthy portfolio additions. All three stocks are transforming the future of the automobile industry with EVs, hybrid cars, and more.

With the Electric Vehicle market currently valued between $200-500 billion, and a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) close to 20% or higher, the evolution of the auto industry is just beginning.

Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla is without a doubt the industry leader in EV production and it has the market cap to prove it. Tesla’s market cap of $870 billion blows away GM’s $57 billion and Ford’s $62 billion. Tesla is the market leader in battery powered electric cars sales in the U.S., commanding 70% of the market share.

Tesla stock is down 23% year to date compared to the S&P 500’s 17% drop. This decline may be a healthy correction for the stock, as TSLA is up 1,060% over the last five years. Tesla has drastically outperformed its auto peers and the benchmark. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

The somewhat prolonged selloff this year may have created opportunities for investors. Also, TSLA recently completed a 3-for-1 stock split. Shares are currently trading around $270 a share. This is far more affordable than previous levels that saw the stock routinely push towards the $1,000 a share mark. TSLA had a 5-for-1 split in 2020.

At current levels, TSLA has a forward P/E of 69X. The industry average P/E is 11X. But investors are willing to pay up for Tesla because of its growth prospects. Tesla’s Forward P/E at the moment is also a lot lower than the high of 307X it saw earlier in the year and the median around 129X.

Story continues

Tesla’s earnings are expected to climb 75% at $3.97 a share in 2022, based on Zacks estimates. Fiscal 2023 calls for another 28% earnings growth. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales set to jump 58% this year and another 41% in FY23 to $120.58 billion.

TSLA currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with estimate revisions on the rise.

General Motors (GM)

Before there was a Tesla, General Motors was one of the gems of the auto industry. GM played a dominant role in the auto industry for much of the last century.

General Motors’ performance has been lackluster this year, with the stock down 35% to underperform the S&P 500. Over the last five years, GM is up a modest 15%.

GM sales have been solid with its U.S. market share hitting 14.4% of total industry sales in 2021. Despite massive sales numbers, the company has often missed sales expectations. A lot is expected of GM, even when beating earnings expectations, the misses on the top line are part of the reason why investors have been selling the stock. Prior to its Q2 earnings miss, GM had beat earnings expectations for 15 straight quarters. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

GM has forward P/E of 5.6X, well below its industry average of 11X.  Despite its low P/E, investors are cautious of GM losing more of its footing in the auto industry. Much of the worry is attributed to Tesla taking market share, and the increasing competition from other companies competing in EV evolution.

With that being said, sales are projected to be up 58% for the current quarter at $42.31 billion. Fiscal 2022 sales are projected to climb 21% and another 6% in FY23 at $164.23 billion. Despite the sales growth, earnings are expected to be down 4% this year and another 3% in FY23 at $6.59 per share. For GM, continuing to grow market share will stem from its ability to innovate in the electric vehicle space. General Motors does have an impressive future pipeline of EV vehicles, which includes the Electric Hummer.

GM currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has an overall “A” VGM score. And GM recently brought back its dividend, creating more value for investors. GM’s reinstated dividend has a current yield of 0.94%, at $0.36 a share.

Ford (F)

Ford Motors may be not be a “dark horse” on the list, as it has become the second best-selling EV brand in the U.S. behind Tesla. Ford stock’s low price per share of under $15 will certainly be attractive to some investors.

Ford is a thoroughbred in designing and manufacturing cars, trucks, and SUVs. Ford’s F-150 had been the best-selling vehicle for 40 straight years, and the industry’s top selling truck for 45 consecutive years.

Ford has also made a push into the electric vehicle market. Similar to General Motors, much of its future stock appreciation may hinge on taking market share in the EV space.

Ford is down 28% this year, after hitting multi-year highs in January. Ford has underperformed the S&P 500 YTD and in the last five years, but has made some nice strides in the right direction. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Most recently, Ford beat Q2 earnings expectations by 58% at $0.68 a share. Ford had a nice streak of blasting earnings expectations, starting in Q2 2020 through Q3 2021, which helped propel the stock to multi-year highs, as seen in the chart above.

Fiscal 2022 earnings are projected to be up 31%, with a small 0.8% drop expected for FY23. Top line growth is expected to be up 16% this year and another 3% in FY23 at $152.12 billion.

Ford has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, the company is headed in the right direction with an impressive EV lineup that will include the F–150 Lightning and Mustang Mach–E.

Ford’s President and CEO Jim Farley recently stated the company’s anticipated growth rate in EVs through 2026 is more than twice what they expect for the global EV industry in total. If this even comes close to fruition, Ford will certainly be taking much more market share as sales would seemingly soar considering the future growth the EV market still has to offer.

856,EV Trend Hits a Roadblock,"Anyone who knows me or has read my stuff throughout the years knows that I’m a car guy.

I’ve always liked cars… especially cars that are really nice and really fast. I have owned dozens throughout the years – and yeah, I’ve gotten a few speeding tickets along the way, too.

Overall, I’m very bullish about the massive shift toward electric vehicles (EVs), and I like that some of them will also be really nice and really fast.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

But… I am also really frustrated.

My family owns an Audi e-tron. It’s nice. It’s powerful. And it’s fast (0-60 mph in 5.5 seconds).

When it works. It won’t charge anymore, after only 22,000 miles.

It has been at the dealer for about six weeks now, waiting for the approximately 740-pound battery pack to be removed for further diagnosis. The dealer has only one lift to remove the battery pack, and with other e-trons also having battery failures, we’re waiting our turn in line.

At least it’s under warranty. Otherwise, it would be essentially worthless… kind of like an old cell phone.

The fact is that batteries are not just the biggest, most important component of an electric vehicle, they are also the biggest challenge. Knowing this can help point you to the best opportunities in this unstoppable trend…

All About the Battery

EVs will have their day. There is no question about that. But as with any transformative trend, getting there will be a little bumpy at times.

Automakers know how to build the vehicle’s body, tune its suspension, adjust the brakes, align the wheels, and all of that good stuff. What they need is a battery that is safe, reliable, and can hold a charge long enough for people to want to pay for an EV.

There are three primary battery technologies in use and development right now. As I survey the EV landscape, it appears that lithium iron phosphate batteries will be utilized for city EVs, lithium-ion batteries will be used for premium EVs (Audi, Ford, Lucid, Mercedes, Rivian, Porsche, etc.), and solid-state batteries will eventually be available in limited luxury EVs from Audi, Bentley, Mercedes, Lamborghini and Porsche.

Story continues

Unfortunately, these batteries are getting more expensive as demand increases for the metals needed to make them. In particular, the prices of cobalt, lithium and nickel have shot higher the last couple of years. But so have the costs of producing traditional fuel-powered vehicles as steel and aluminum prices are also up.

Money Continues to Pour Into EV Development

Higher costs are not slowing down automakers’ aggressive pursuit of EVs. The worlds second-largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE:TM), just revealed this past week that it is investing an additional $2.5 billion for its Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina (TBMNC) facility to support battery electric vehicle (BEV) battery production.

The $2.5 billion is on top of Toyota’s initial $1.29 billion investment in 2021 allocated for battery production at the North Carolina facility, bringing the total investment to $3.8 billion. Company management commented, “This plant will serve a central role in Toyota’s leadership toward a fully electrified future and will help us meet our goal of carbon neutrality in our vehicles and global operations by 2035.”

Toyota also reiterated its commitment to sell 3.5 million EVs by 2030, and its investment of about $30 billion in EVs over the next 10 years. The company noted that it wants to “build a supply system that can steadily meet the growing demand” for EVs.

Also this week, the new CEO of Volkswagen, Oliver Blume, said he wants to maintain and even increase the world’s largest automaker’s pursuit of electrification. The previous CEO had set goals to pass Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in EV sales by 2025 and to make one of every two new cars sold be electric by 2030.

Blume is also the CEO of Porsche, which currently has the Taycan as its all-electric model. Porsche’s EV sales more than doubled in 2021.

Go for the Growth

Clearly, the EV trend continues to rev up, and we want to be in the driver’s seat when it really puts it pedal to the metal. To do this, we want to stay invested in companies that have aligned their business to profit from the EV revolution, as well as already have accelerating earnings and sales momentum.

These fundamentally superior companies with strong buying pressure are the best ways to build wealth any time, but especially now when the economy is slowing. There is still growth out there, and that’s where the best wealth-building opportunities are.

Growth does get harder to find in times like these, and if you would like my help, my proprietary analytical and ratings system helps us find the best of the best. You’ll find those stocks on my Growth Investor Buy Lists. You can click here if you’re interested in learning more.

A quick reminder before you go: The stock market will be closed on Monday, September 6, in celebration of the Labor Day holiday. The InvestorPlace offices and customer service department will also be closed.

I hope you have a wonderful holiday weekend!

P.S. There is a great divide opening up in America – and investing in my Growth Investor stocks will help get you on the right side of it. On one side is a new aristocracy that’s amassing more wealth more quickly than any other group in American history. For people like me, the one percent, life has never been better, more prosperous.

On the other side, the opposite is happening. Wealth is flowing out of the pockets of ordinary Americans at an unprecedented rate.

What’s happening is only going to gather in strength over the coming decades. It certainly won’t weaken.

Few Americans even know that any of this is going on. I’ve never seen anyone from my side of the chasm step forward to explain any of these things.

It’s why I put together this video. In it, I’ll lay out exactly what is happening, including several key steps every American should take right now.

862,13 Largest Lithium Producers In The World,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 largest lithium producers in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest lithium producers in the world.

When considering elements, lithium hardly seems to be on the forefront, with more exotic, precious elements such as gold, silver and platinum taking center stage. And for a long time, the value of lithium has been insignificant, but all that changed once the world realized that lithium-based batteries could store energy generated from renewable resources at a high density, a game changer for advocating the switch from non-renewable resources to renewable resources. This has catapulted the importance of lithium into the stratosphere, as it is the most essential part of lithium-based batteries, and in the near future, could help renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels as the primary source of fuel. You might think this is an exaggeration but 79% of the consumption of crude oil is to power ships, planes and cars. We already have the technology and ability to replace 50% of this consumption through battery-powered vehicles. Lithium, Battery, Electric, Vehicle

Electric vehicles have hit the ground running, and what once seemed like a side project for most car companies, has become the main priority for most, in what is the biggest shift in transportation in over a century. In 2016, Volkswagen, the biggest automaker in the world with over 10.8 million vehicles sold each year, announced a Strategy 2025 plan which stated its ambition of launching thirty models which would be powered purely by a lithium battery, while also expecting a quarter of all vehicles sold by 2025 to be fully electric. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is already considered a pioneer in terms of building electric vehicles powered by lithium batteries, which has enabled it to become the most valuable automaker in the world. The demand for lithium grew more than 30 times between 2000 and 2015, while it's expected to increase another 10 times between 2015 and 2025. Despite the pandemic, many companies are still investing heavily in lithium-based batteries.

Story continues

While all logic points towards moving to lithium, it is easier said than done, because even if a world as connected as the one we live in today, politics dominate, and in the case of lithium, China dominates. Back in 2015, a strategic plan was developed by China to become a global technological powerhouse by 2025, which made the development of the lithium industry a top national priority. Meanwhile, China was also focused on reducing pollution, and imposed stringent emission standards which all companies have to meet. While there is debate on whether companies are actually being held to this standard, but it has to be said that in 2019, Beijing exited the list of 200 most polluted cities in the world. China also ensured that it would not miss out on the race to dominating lithium resources, as it did when hydrocarbon resources were up for grabs, knowing that a similar mistake would cause significant damage to its ambition on being a world leader.

While lithium has other uses, such as being used in cell phones, its overwhelming importance is in the usage of batteries for electric vehicles, which means its importance is dependent upon the demand for electric vehicles. While there is a push from most governments and incentives as well to adapt to electric vehicles, many people are still reluctant, based mainly on the driving range on a single charge, availability of charging stations, psychology and the life of the battery among other reasons. However, it also cannot be denied that this is an important step in ensuring a better world for future generations, even as we see the serious effects of climate change. You can look at the record-breaking heatwave in Europe, to major storms in the United States to catastrophic biblical proportion floods in Pakistan and gain a perspective on how climate change is slowly destroying the world, and that extreme steps are needed very quickly to curtail this.

Despite lithium being heralded as an important component in the fight against climate change, that is not necessarily absolutely true. Lithium mining is having an adverse effect in shallow, saltwater lakes in the Chilean Andes where flamingos reside. Two species of flamingos in the region have already lost more than 10% of their population. This is a result of brine extraction which can negatively impact potable water in surrounding areas as well.

The top lithium producers in the world have enjoyed a major price increase, with lithium carbonate prices rising 58% to average $11,000/tonne, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Further, production also increased significantly in 2021, by 27% when compared to the previous year. Price in 2022 have soared even more, with a 400% increase in just the first 5 months to $54,000/tonne, a record level. So, who exactly are the biggest lithium producers in the world? We have used Forbes and Investing News to rank the giants in the game, starting with number 15:

12. Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL)

Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL) is an American lithium mining company, which aims to develop a world-class integrated lithium business in the United States. Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL) is positioning itself to be one of the lowest cost producers of lithium hydroxide in the world, with the strategy to become a prime supplier to the fast growing electric vehicle industry in the United States.

Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ:PLL) is yet to record revenues, considering it was established only recently and is currently busy establishing operations.

12. Savannah Resources

Savannah Resources is Europe's leading lithium development company, and aims to help ease the transition to lithium-based batteries in Europe. The company is well-poised to make a major impact, especially considering the fact that Europe's lithium needs will be 18 times greater in 2030 as compared to 2020, and more than 60 times greater in 2050.

Savannah Resources is sourcing lithium from the Barroso Lithium Project in Portugal.

11. Baconara Lithium

Baconara Lithium is 'focused on building a 35,000 TPA battery grade lithium operation in Sonara, Mexico.."". The company is partnering with Ganfeng Lithium, which is also in our list. But to find out its position, you have to keep on reading! The company is focused on helping the world transition to a lower carbon footprint, and the Sonara Lithium Project is going to play a major role in the company's ambitions.

10. Allkem

It makes sense for an Australian company to be among the largest lithium producers in the world, considering Australia has sizable lithium deposits. Allkem was renamed in November 2021, formerly known as Orocobre Limited. It acquired Galaxy Resources Limited in 2021 as well.

9. Pilbara Minerals

One of Australia's top lithium companies, Pilbara Minerals is also among the largest lithium producers in the world. The company's Pilangoora Project is one of the largest hard rock lithium deposits in the world. Recording $176 million in 2021, the company posted losses of $51 million.

8. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC)

Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) has operations in Argentina and the United States, and has raised over $1 billion in debt and equity. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC) has two major projects in Argentina, Cauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes, while also focusing on the Thacker Pass Project in Nevada. The Thacker Project has been advancing towards construction while Cauchari-Olaroz is moving towards initial production.

7. Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM)

Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) is focused on harnessing lithium technology to lead towards a more sustainable, healthier world. Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) has a market cap of $5.7 billion and recorded revenues of more than $420 million in 2021.

Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) has been in existence for six decades and is aiming to continue being the leader in lithium technology.

6. Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group Co. Ltd.

Sichuan Yahua Industrial is mainly involved in the manufacture of explosives and is also involved in the manufacture and selling of lithium, being considered one of the leading lithium suppliers in China. Its operations boast a 12,000 ton per year lithium hydroxide refinery, not to mention a 6,000 ton per year lithium carbonate refinery. It has also obtained rights to explore one of the largest lithium quarries in Asia which can result in the production of 180,000 tons of lithium concentrate each year.

865,Jay Leno: Elon Musk deserves 'a lot of credit' for leading EV charge,"Comedian and car collector extraordinaire Jay Leno hasn’t seen a four-wheeler or even two-wheeler he doesn’t like.

The man has a collection of over 200 cars and bikes at his garage outside of Los Angeles as proof, but has shown a particular interest in recent years in electric vehicles (EVs), which he said was partially sparked by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.

""I think he should get a certain amount of credit for leading the charge because before Elon, [people would say] 'it's a golf cart,'"" Leno told Yahoo Finance. ""People would joke about electric [that] they're slow and whatever it might be. So I give him a lot of credit for it. I think EV will be the savior of the classic car industry."" Elon Musk and Jay Leno driving the Tesla Cybertruck. (Photo: Jay Leno's Garage)

Leno, whose show Jay Leno's Garage is entering its 7th season this September, has owned a Tesla Model S for many years, and it's the only car he has ever sold from his collection. (He only sold that to pick up a brand new Tesla Model S plaid.)

His interest in the EV space spans back to 2007, when Musk visited Leno's garage with his Roadster prototype.

""I remember sitting and he said: 'Well, what I want to do is build charging stations all up and down the coast,'"" Leno recalled. ""And I'm going 'ok, that'll happen, that sounds good.'""

Leno was skeptical at the time, as only a handful of electric cars were on the road, like the GM EV1 and Honda Insight EV Plus. The concept of building a charging network seemed somewhat incomprehensible.

According to U.S. News & World Report, there are over 31,000 individual Tesla charging points around the world spread across nearly 3,500 Tesla Supercharger stations, as of 2021. Roughly one-third of those stations are scattered throughout the U.S. across all 50 states. Tesla Supercharger station locations in the U.S. (Map: Tesla)

""He started building the infrastructure almost at the exact time he started building the car,"" Leno said. ""When the car debuted, you could drive LA to San Francisco. And now, you can go anywhere in the country. You see a lot of other automakers get into the EV market saying you can charge it anywhere. You can't really.""

Story continues

Fifteen years have gone by since that conversation in the garage and now nearly every traditional automaker has an ambitious EV transformation plan. On top of that, President Biden recently signed the Inflation Reduction Act that will extend federal tax credits for Americans who are looking to buy reasonably priced EVs.

As for Leno, his interest in EVs spans beyond Tesla — he also strongly believes regular Americans will buy Ford’s (F) new F-150 Lightning electric pickup as it becomes available.

867,Tesla steps up recruiting in Thailand as EV competition heats up,"BANGKOK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is stepping up recruitment in Thailand, Southeast's Asia automotive hub, with the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker looking to hire a business development manager and recruiters, its website shows.

The job announcements come as demand and interest for EVs in Thailand picks up due to concerns over high energy prices and with government consumer incentives.

Nearly 20 Bangkok-based jobs including a home charging developer were advertised on its website and the position of a charging infrastructure lead was posted on LinkedIn on Monday.

Other vacancies were for vehicle technicians, customer service and a parts adviser.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Thailand is not expected to be a production site for Tesla for now, though the government has been promoting sales of EVs and there is speculation the company might set up official showrooms.

Thailand is Asia's fourth-largest auto assembly and export hub for companies like Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd.

It produces about 1.5 million to 2 million vehicles annually, of which about half of which are exported.

Domestic demand for EVs is a crucial part of a Thai government strategy to preserve its status as a top regional automaker. The government is targeting production of 725,000 EVs a year, or 30% of total vehicle output, by 2030.

Chinese automakers have began selling EVs in Thailand at what customers say are affordable prices. Great Wall Motors launched its ORA Good Cat model at the annual motor show for 828,500 baht ($22,600).

Great Wall Motors has said it plans to produce the model in Thailand in 2024.

China's Hozon Auto last month unveiled the NETA V for 549,000 baht ($15,000), matching starting prices for traditional vehicles.

Meanwhile, Indonesian President Joko Widodo in August urged Tesla to manufacture its cars and batteries, in his country. ($1 = 36.5600 baht) (Reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng Editing by Ed Davies)",2022-09-05T12:04:48+00:00,2022-09-05
868,"EV Roundup: NKLA's Equity Offering, Tesla's Plan for Driverless Cars &amp; More","Last week, China-based electric vehicle (EV) stars NIO Inc. NIO, Li Auto LI and XPeng Inc. XPEV announced their delivery updates for August. While NIO recorded a rise in deliveries from July levels, XPeng and Li Auto witnessed a month-over-month fall in sales. A slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with supply chain snarls induced by the resurgence of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns, hurt the deliveries. LI was, in fact, the worst hit, with its August deliveries not just tumbling month on month but also plummeting more than 50% year over year.

Meanwhile, Arizona-based electric truck maker Nikola Corp. NKLA stated its intention to raise capital via a $400 million stock offering.The company is battling production bottlenecks, commodity cost inflation and logistic challenges, which are worsening its liquidity profile, thereby inducing it to seek cash infusion.

Finally, EV king Tesla TSLA also made it to the top stories as CEO Musk announced at an energy conference in Norway that the company’s fully self-driven cars will hit the U.S. and European market by 2022-end.

While Tesla holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) currently, LI, XPEV, NIO and NKLA carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here

Inside the Headlines

NIO delivered 10,677 vehicles in August, up 81.6% year over year. The deliveries include 7,551 premium smart electric SUVs and 3,126 premium smart electric sedans. NIO’s deliveries rose 6% from July’s figure of 10,052 vehicles. From the beginning of the year till Aug 31, NIO delivered 71,556 vehicles, rising 28.3% year over year.

Cumulative deliveries of NIO vehicles reached 238,626 as of Aug 31, 2022. In August, NIO started boosting the production of the new ES7 SUV, a mid-large five-seater premium smart electric SUV. Featuring the NIO Technology 2.0 (NT2), it was unveiled in June and rolled out the first orders to customers in China. In August, 398 units of ES7 were delivered.

Story continues

XPeng reported 9,578 monthly deliveries of Smart EVs in August, representing a 33% uptick year over year. The figure comprises 5,745 P7s, XPeng’s smart sports sedan, 2,678 P5 smart family sedans and 1,155 G3i and G3 smart compact SUVs. XPeng saw a fall in month-on-month sales of 16% from 11,524 cars in July. The company delivered 90,085 Smart EVs for the first eight months of the year, representing a 96% increase year over year.

Last month, in its earnings release, XPeng announced that it envisioned third-quarter 2022 deliveries in the band of 29000-31000 units, lower than 34,422 vehicles sold in the second quarter of 2022. XPeng President Brian Gu stated that the guidance indicated the fact that the industry is gradually entering a “relatively slow season” and that store traffic is likely to be less amid COVID-19 woes.

Li Auto saw deliveries of 4,571 vehicles in August 2022. The deliveries marked a steep fall of 51% year over year. Its cumulative deliveries totaled 199,484 as of the end of the month. Sales plunged 56% from 10,422 vehicles in July. In August, Li commenced deliveries of the Li L9, its six-seater, full-size flagship SUV for families, which was launched in June.

LI stated that it was getting ready to launch Li L8, a large premium smart SUV for families, in early November, with deliveries commencing in the same month. The Li L8 model will be available in two variants, namely a six-seater and a VIP five-seater, to cater to diverse family groups. As of Aug 31, 2022, Li’s retail stores summed 265 in 118 cities, its servicing centers were 316 and Li Auto-authorized body and paint shops were operating in 226 cities.

Nikola announced plans to issue up to $400 million in new stock in an “at-the-market” offering. On its second-quarter earnings call, Nikola had indicated that it was likely to raise additional funds to ramp up production amid escalating costs. NKLA targets to deliver 300-500 production Tre BEV Trucks this year. With the aim to boost production amid rising battery costs, when it is already reeling under cash crunch and supply chain snarls (worsened by the Russia-Ukraine war), it doesn’t come as a surprise that the company had to resort to stock sale to raise capital.

As the company moves ahead with its $144 million buyout of battery supplier Romeo Power, Nikola also announced that it has begun the exchange offer to buy all outstanding shares of Romeo Power. In another development, the EV maker announced key leadership changes. Pablo Koziner has been made the president of the company’s Commercial division and Carey Mendes has been named president of the Energy unit. The presidents of both divisions are expected to report to Nikola’s president Michael Lohscheller, who will also become the CEO on Jan 1, 2023.

Tesla announced that the company is targeting the end of 2022 for its self-driving technology to be widely available in the United States and Europe markets. Tesla's existing Full Self-Driving package or FSD needs to be retrofitted to a vehicle at $15,000. The current features in the FSD package allow the vehicle to autonomously stop at signs and traffic lights, park, react to traffic while in cruise control and steer on both freeways and city streets. However, it still requires supervision from a driver. The updated version will allow vehicles to drive independently without requiring a human occupant.

Musk stated that owners of the fully autonomous Tesla vehicles might send them out as a ride-hailing service while they are at work, allowing them to earn some extra income instead of keeping the cars parked, which in turn entails a fee.The company aims to have approximately 1 million people in the FSD beta by the year-end.

870,Cathie Wood is Loading Up on These 10 Stocks,"In this article, we discuss the 10 stocks that Cathie Wood is loading up on. If you want to read about some more stocks in the Cathie Wood portfolio, go directly to Cathie Wood is Loading Up on These 5 Stocks.

Cathie Wood of ARK Investment Management has been under fire for her growth-focused investment strategy amid recession fears in the past few months. Her flagship ARK Innovation Fund, one of the best-performing investment vehicles of the pandemic-ravaged 2020 with a gain of over 152% during the year, is down over 58% year-to-date as investors shift away from risky bets towards value options in light of rising interest rates. Wood managed an equity portfolio worth close to $17 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2022.

Some of the top stocks in the portfolio include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX). Between March and June 2022, the value of the equity portfolio decreased by around $6 billion. In this time, Wood made new purchases in 9 stocks, sold out of 12, reduced holdings in 223, and made additional purchases in 102 stocks. The top ten holdings comprise over 46% of the overall portfolio. The top holdings are concentrated in the tech and healthcare sectors.

The woes of her fund have seen investors pull money from under her management. Data compiled by news publication Bloombergreveals that there was nearly $803 million in outflows from her flagship fund in the month of August, the biggest monthly outflow since September 2021. The fund also witnessed daily inflows during just six days in August. The performance of her fund so far this year does not compare favorably to the benchmark S&P 500, which is down only around 18% year-to-date.

Our Methodology

These were picked according to the investment portfolio of ARK Investment Management at the end of the second quarter of 2022. Only equities in which the hedge fund increased stakes by at least 20% or more, between March and June, compared to first quarter filings, were selected. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.

10. Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34

Percentage Increase in Stake During Q2 2022: 23%

Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) owns and runs a TV streaming platform. The hedge fund chaired by Wood owned close to 10.1 million shares of Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) at the end of June 2022 worth $962 million.

On August 26, Truist analyst Matthew Thornton maintained a Buy rating on Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock and lowered the price target to $90 from $120, noting that the firm had posted weaker than expected earnings in the second quarter.

At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 34 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.4 billion in Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU), the same as in the preceding quarter worth $1.7 billion.

Just like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) is one of the stocks that Cathie Wood is bullish on.

In its Q3 2021 investor letter, RGA Investment Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Since we bought Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU), no stock has contributed more to our returns and no stock has been more volatile in our portfolio. This is now our third drawdown in the stock of over 30% and our second of over 60%. Fortunately (or tactically) before the two 60% drawdowns we had trimmed our positions by at least a third, though unfortunately that meant we still held large slices of the stock on the way down. Despite the stock having soared too far, too fast and thinking it was due for a period of digestion, we believe over our timeframe even the former highs will be rewarded with a good result. We have often pointed out that volatility in companies like Roku is the market’s way of grappling with a really wide range of potential outcomes and that remains as true today as ever, though the range of outcomes continues to narrow for the better for Roku.

Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) today is trading at lower multiples than at any point as a public company, meanwhile its revenue and margin composition has evolved from majority hardware to vast majority platform– in other words, each $1 of revenue is much more valuable today than ever before for Roku. Roku today is a profitable company for the first time in its history. Roku today has a multitude of investment opportunities within its own platform that can drive considerable value. Early in 2021 at higher prices, one had to believe the company would grow accounts internationally to justify valuations. This was so, because the company has so quickly achieved substantial penetration of the US market with 56.4m reported household customers of the ~130m total US households, that further growth in the US household count will be challenging and because prices were so high. Today, one merely needs to believe that with around 60 million households (the expectation for the yet reported year-end 2021 number), ARPU has a strong enough growth tailwind to reach $100 within a reasonable time, without relying on any incremental account growth. For context, as of Q3 this year, ARPU was $40, up 49% year-over-year and we know it will be higher in Q4. Growth in ARPU is underpinned by the continuing migration of viewer hours to CTV. The subforces behind this are increasing the penetration of Roku devices within households (go from one Roku to TV to 2-4), increasing the hours that each house watches (getting from shy of 4 hours to the nearly 8 hours an average American household watches TV) and broadening the content on the platform, increasing the share of inventory with content companies and more hours (like live sports viewing) shifting from linear to CTV. We further believe the opportunity to become the bundler and/or hub of household content subscriptions is growing, as evidenced by the rise in credit card pings per user from 1 to 1.3 per month and its continuing ascension. In this respect, Roku has the right to win with their installed base, because the experience is exponentially better than legacy and competing offerings…” (Click here to see the full text)

871,"Elon Musk told Trump to sail into the sunset, now the former President tells supporters it’s time to get rid of electric cars in Pennsylvania rally rant","In his first comments since the FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago compound, Donald Trump took aim at electric vehicles in a speech over the weekend that managed to attack two of his main opponents—rising Republican star Elon Musk as well as incumbent President Joe Biden.

Trump’s ambition to be the first to win back the White House since Grover Cleveland in 1893 was dealt a blow last month when law enforcement authorities seized confidential records property of the federal government unlawfully stored at Trump’s Florida home.

The polarizing Apprentice reality TV star-turned-politician had already been facing an uphill battle of late. Soaring gas prices have been on the decline, robbing Republicans of their biggest cudgel, while Biden pushed through a series of signature legislative wins for his policy agenda including tax breaks for electric vehicles popularized by Musk’s Tesla.

At a speech this weekend in the coal-mining town of Wilkes-Barre in Pennsylvania, Trump hinted he would roll back any such subsidies, recounting a story about a friend fed up with driving their EV from Kentucky to Washington, DC, due to all the alleged charging stops.

“He told me (…) ‘please, please let’s get rid of this stuff’,” claimed Trump, adding it allegedly took the person “more time to charge the damn car” than spent driving it.

Trump often indicates his own personal preferences by couching them in stories based on unnamed, anonymous people that are difficult if not near impossible to verify in an attempt to make them sound like they enjoy broad grassroots support.

For example, it would seem unlikely that Trump could have referred to Kentucky representative Thomas Massie, one of the few Republican members of Congress to drive a Tesla. The MIT-educated electrical engineer has been a customer of Musk for a decade now and would be well accustomed to driving one.

Feud with Musk

Any rollback on EVs would likely hurt Musk’s business. Despite its competitors’ best efforts, Musk’s company continues to dominate the U.S. market for EVs. According to industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, every two out of three new EVs sold in the country sported a Tesla badge on the hood.

Story continues

Importantly, the visionary CEO not only has a growing following among Republicans ever since he switched parties, but he also opposes Trump’s continued grip on the party and favors his greatest internal competitor: Florida governor Ron DeSantis.

A subsequent feud erupted after Trump branded Musk “another bullshit artist”, prompting the Tesla CEO to tell the ex-President his political career was over.

“It’s time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset,” he wrote, ending any debate over whether he might back the real estate tycoon’s bid for another term in the White House.

His support for DeSantis puts him at odds with the Tesla CEO’s own former business partner, Peter Thiel, an influential Silicon Valley venture capitalist and early backer of Trump during his victorious 2016 bid for power.

Rust belt win

The auto industry is not just any. It stands for the decline of the American middle class once built on steady, well-paid factory jobs with health care, pensions and other benefits.

Trump managed to win the 2016 election against a heavily favored Hillary Clinton by defeating her in the nation’s Rust Belt.

He was able to flip blue states like Michigan thanks to his attack on the NAFTA free trade agreement that shipped thousands of U.S. assembly plant jobs south of the border as well as threats to impose punitive 25% import tariffs on Mexican-built cars.

Although Biden defeated him by retaking Democratic strongholds through his embrace of trade unions like the United Auto Workers, his effusive praise for Tesla’s rivals like General Motors hasn’t always panned out.

CEO Mary Barra recently decided to build the Chevrolet Blazer EV in Mexico rather than a UAW-organized plant.

Should Trump lead the Republican ticket in 2024, he will likely need UAW members to once more place their faith in his “America First” policies, despite notable defeats as well.

But first, he will have to defeat DeSantis, whose popularity is on the rise ever since the January 6th House committee hearings have reflected badly on Trump's role in the Capitol riots.

Trump’s attack on EVs comes days after Tucker Carlson devoted a portion of his daily show to portraying these cars as a danger to liberty and a trojan horse for state control as regulators like those in California can impose rolling blackouts.

“You have hundreds of millions of Americans dependent upon cars that the government can turn off in a second, that are by the way running software that tracks your every movement,” the controversial Fox News host said last week.

Given the proper hardware, any car can be tracked—China instituted this for its new vehicle fleet. Yet it is Tesla that popularized collecting its customers' data for the purposes of delivering products like its Full-Self Driving assistance system and Tesla Insurance.

Trump’s broadside against EVs brought condemnations from Musk’s faithful such as Eva McMillan, who boasts nearly 11,000 subscribers that follow her FSD beta tests and other related Tesla content.

“I can’t believe I voted for Trump twice,” she posted. ""I looked over his arrogant personality for many years. Now he is potentially hurting Tesla and that’s a fine line. He lost a great believer.""

875,"Tech stocks: MATANA is the new FAANG, analyst says","It's time to rethink who's at the top of the Big Tech food-chain, Constellation Research Principal Analyst & Founder Ray Wang told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).

Wang argued that MATANA — Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) – is an upgrade to FAANG by dropping Meta (META) and Netflix (NFLX) while adding Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia.

In 2013, when Jim Cramer of CNBC's ""Mad Money"" coined the term FAANG, many of those companies were thought of as upstarts who'd taken their respective markets by storm. This was especially true of Meta — then Facebook — and Netflix. But now, Wang said, both should be re-assessed. Meta, in particular, needs a new plan.

""Facebook has got to do something besides ads,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""Once again, they're taking a beating for it. So, is it going to be the glasses? Is it going to be the metaverse? We're not there yet and that's really kind of what the challenge is."" Tesla founder Elon Musk attends Offshore Northern Seas 2022 in Stavanger, Norway August 29, 2022. (NTB/Carina Johansen via REUTERS)

For Netflix, it's a question of growth, and what is and isn't on the table. And because the company's operating on a subscription model, Wang has questions about how much further they could go.

""The reason they're out is because, how many more subscribers? How many more subscriptions are you going to handle?"" he said. ""Product placement should be where they are, plus the ability to do IP licensing. Look at how Disney makes its money.""

Wang stressed that Microsoft, which is often viewed as one of tech's leading legacy names, should be included in the group of tech's most elite leaders (and sometimes has been with the bulky FAAMNG acronym).

""Microsoft has more than just business-to-business and consumer – they've been able to manage both,"" he said. ""They're positioned well for the metaverse. They're positioned well for the cloud and, of course, they've got their gaming business.""

Rounding out the new grouping would be Tesla — a well-known success story at this point — and Nvidia.

Story continues

""Nvidia is a lot more than just the chips that we look at and more than the data center or gaming,"" Wang said. ""They're sitting at the edge between AI, the metaverse, the future of computing, and the way they do their partnerships, they're set up in a way that's going to be dominant for quite some time.""

876,INSIGHT-Inside Tesla's drive to keep Musk's battery promise,"* Tesla can cut $5,500 off Model Y battery costs - experts

* Savings from bigger cells and new manufacturing process

* Tesla yet to ramp up new 'dry-coating' technique - experts

By Norihiko Shirouzu and Paul Lienert

Sept 6 (Reuters) - The secret behind Elon Musk's goal of selling 20 million Tesla's a year by 2030 lies in its pioneering battery technology.

The good news is that by using bigger cells and a new process to dry-coat electrodes, Tesla could halve the cost of a Model Y battery, saving more than 8% of the car's U.S. starting price, battery experts with ties to the company said.

The bad news is that it's only halfway there, according to 12 experts close to Tesla or familiar with its new technology.

That's because the dry-coating technique used to produce the bigger cells in Tesla's 4680 battery is so new and unproven the company is having trouble scaling up manufacturing to the point where the big cost savings kick in, the experts told Reuters.

""They just aren't ready for mass production,"" said one of the experts close to Tesla.

Still, the gains Tesla has already made in cutting battery production costs in the past two years could help boost profits and extend its lead over most electric vehicle (EV) rivals.

Musk's promised improvements in battery cost and performance are seen by investors as critical to Tesla's quest to usher in an era where it can sell a $25,000 EV for a profit - and stand a better chance of hitting its 2030 targets.

Battery systems are the most expensive single element in most EVs, so making lower-cost, high-performance packs is key to producing affordable electric cars that can go toe to toe with combustion-engine rivals on sticker prices.

Tesla is one of only a handful of major automakers that produce their own EV batteries and by manufacturing Model Y cells at U.S. plants, the SUV will remain eligible for U.S. tax credits when many rival EVs may no longer qualify.

Story continues

Among the 12 battery experts Reuters spoke with, nine have close ties to Tesla and three of the nine have examined Tesla's new and old battery technology inside and out through teardowns.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

'HE WILL SOLVE IT'

The sources predict that Tesla will find it difficult to fully implement the new dry-coating manufacturing process before the end of this year, and perhaps not until 2023.

Stan Whittingham, a co-inventor of lithium-ion batteries and a 2019 Nobel laureate, believes Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has been overly optimistic on the time frame for commercializing the new technique. ""I think he will solve it, but it won't be as quick as he likes. It's going to take some time to really test it,"" he said.

In August, Musk told shareholders Tesla would be producing high volumes of 4680 batteries by the end of 2022.

According to the experts, Tesla has only been able to cut the Model Y's battery cost by between $2,000 and $3,000 so far, about half the savings Tesla had planned for the 4680 battery, which it unveiled two years ago.

But those savings have come mainly from the design of the new 4680 cells, which are bigger than those in Tesla's current 2170 battery, they said.

But the heart of the drive to push down costs is the dry-coating technology, which Musk has described as revolutionary but difficult to execute.

According to the sources, it should deliver as much as half of the $5,500 cost savings Tesla hopes to achieve, by slashing manufacturing costs and one-time capital spending.

Tesla acquired the know-how in 2019 when it paid over $200 million for Maxwell Technologies, a company in San Diego making ultracapacitors, which store energy for devices that need quick bursts of electricity, such as camera flashes.

Building on Maxwell's technology, Tesla began making 4680 dry cells this year, first in a pilot near its Fremont, California plant and more recently at its new global headquarters in Austin, Texas.

'BEST IN CLASS'

The technology allows Tesla to ditch the older, more complex and costly wet-coating process. It's expensive because it needs a substantial amount of electricity, machinery, factory space, time, and a large labour force.

To coat electrodes in the wet process, battery producers mix the materials with toxic binder solvents. Once coated, the electrodes are dried in massive ovens, with the toxic solvents that evaporate in the process being recovered, treated and recycled - all adding to the cost.

With the new technology, electrodes are coated using different binders with little use of liquids, so they don't need to be dried. That means it's cheaper, faster and also less environmentally damaging.

Because of its simplicity, the process allows Tesla to cut capital spending by a third and slash both the footprint of a factory and its energy consumption to a 10th of what would be needed for the wet process, Tesla has said.

But the company has had trouble commercializing the process, the sources said.

Maxwell developed its dry-coat process for ultracapacitors, but the challenge with coating electrodes for EV batteries is that they are much larger and thicker, which makes it hard to coat them with consistent quality at mass-production speeds.

""They can produce in small volume, but when they started big volume production, Tesla ended up with many rejects, too many,"" one of the sources with ties to Tesla told Reuters.

Production yields were so low that all the anticipated cost savings from the new process were lost, the source said.

If all the potential efficiencies from dry-coating and the bigger cells are realised, the manufacturing cost for the Model Y’s 4680 battery pack should fall to $5,000 to $5,500 - roughly half the cost of the 2170 pack, according to the sources.

The rising cost of battery materials and energy pose a risk to those forecasts, however, and Tesla has not yet been able to significantly improve the new battery's energy density or the amount of power it packs, as Musk has promised.

Still, despite those factors, the savings Tesla is expected to achieve will end up making the 4680 battery the industry's ""best in class"" for the foreseeable future, one source said.

BULKING UP

Much of the $2,000 to $3,000 cost savings achieved with the 4680 battery so far has come from other improvements, and using bigger cells has proven particularly potent, the experts said.

The 4680 cells are 5.5 times the size of the 2170 cells by volume. The older cylindrical cells measure 21mm in diameter and 70mm in height, hence the name. The 4680 cells have a 46mm diameter and are 80mm high.

With the older technology, Tesla needs about 4,400 cells to power the Model Y and there are 17,600 points that need to be welded - four per cell - to create a pack that can be integrated into the car, the sources said.

The 4680 battery pack only needs 830 cells and Tesla has changed the design so that there are only two weld points per cell, slashing the welding to 1,660 points and leading to significant cost savings.

The simpler design also means there are fewer connectors and other components, which has allowed Tesla to save further on labour costs and machine time.

Another source of efficiency has been the larger cell's far sturdier outer case. Tesla can now bond the cells together with adhesive into a rigid honeycomb-like pack which is then connected directly to the inner body structure of the Model Y.

This eliminates the intermediate step of bundling cells into larger modules which are then installed in a traditional battery pack, the sources said.

By shifting to this ""cell to vehicle"" design, Tesla can reduce the weight of a traditional 1,200-pound battery pack by 55 pounds or more - saving about $500 to $600 per pack, one of the sources said.

But mastering the dry-coating technique remains the holy grail.

""Bulking up the battery cell helped a lot in boosting efficiency, but pushing for 50% cost savings for the cell as a whole is another matter,"" one source said.

""That will depend on whether Tesla can deploy the dry-coating process successfully in a factory.""

This eliminates the intermediate step of bundling cells into larger modules which are then installed in a traditional battery pack, the sources said.

By shifting to this ""cell to vehicle"" design, Tesla can reduce the weight of a traditional 1,200-pound battery pack by 55 pounds or more - saving about $500 to $600 per pack, one of the sources said.

But mastering the dry-coating technique remains the holy grail.

""Bulking up the battery cell helped a lot in boosting efficiency, but pushing for 50% cost savings for the cell as a whole is another matter,"" one source said.

""That will depend on whether Tesla can deploy the dry-coating process successfully in a factory.""

New York Fed President John Williams recently said he expects interest rates to continue higher and to remain at those levels until inflation is controlled, as quoted on CNBC. Fed chief Powell too recently commented that taming U.S. inflation will cause ""pain"" for American families and businesses as rate hikes will continue.

As rising rate worries have been prevalent with the Fed hiking rates faster and fatter this year, both the bond and stock investing are at worse. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the fed funds rate by 75bps to 2.25%-2.5% during its July 2022 meeting, marking the fourth consecutive rate hike. Per CME group as of Sep 3, 2022 there is 57% probabilities of a 75-bp rate hike in the September meeting while 43% probability is of a 50-bp rate hike.

Wages also rose, with average hourly earnings up 5.2% from a year ago, slightly lower than the estimate.

Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few top-performing ETFs of last week that gained handsomely.

ETFs in Focus

Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF BDRY – Up 10.9%

Long-term ocean freight rates jumped yet again in August, up 4.1% sequentially and 121.2% higher year over year. The latest global data, crowd-sourced by Oslo-based Xeneta for its Xeneta Shipping Index (XSI), revealed that, despite a decline in spot rates, uneven demand and ongoing supply chain crisis will lead to another solid year of profits for the world’s leading carriers, per an article published on hellenicshippingnews.com.

Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF PFIX – Up 9.9%

Rising rate worries made this ETF a winner. This ETF is active and does not track a benchmark.  The Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF seeks to hedge interest rate movements arising from rising long-term interest rates, and to benefit from market stress when fixed income volatility increases, while providing the potential for income (read: 75-Bp Rate Hike in September? ETFs to Play).

The fund’s strategy includes initial investment of 50% of NAV in 7-year OTC payer swaption on the 20-year rate struck at 4.25%, providing direct exposure to rising rates. Option position is a strategic exposure to interest rates, expected to be reset only after extended periods of time or extreme rate moves. Option term and rate maturity are chosen to minimize cost of ownership; option strike and term chosen to maximize convexity. The fund charges 50 bps in fees.

Axs Tesla Bear Daily ETF TSLQ – Up 6.4%

This ETF is active and does not track a benchmark. The AXS TSLA Bear Daily ETF seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to the inverse of the daily performance of the common shares of Tesla, Inc, which was off 5% last week.

A Piper Sandler analyst cautioned that Tesla stock price may head lower in the coming weeks, on the back of 1) shorter wait times; 2) China weakness; 3) geopolitics; 4) and rising interest rates (higher WACC), as quoted on investing.com.

Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF SARK – Up 5.2%

This ETF is active and does not track a benchmark. The AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF seeks the daily inverse investment results and is intended to be used as a short-term trading vehicle. As the broader market dipped last week, this inverse ETF gained.

882,"Zacks.com featured highlights include Tesla, PAM Systems, Unum Group, LPL Financial Holdings and CSX","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL – September 6, 2022 – Stocks in this week’s article are Tesla, Inc. TSLA, EPAM Systems, Inc. EPAM, Unum Group UNM, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA and CSX Corp. CSX.

5 Stocks with Sales Growth to Buy Amid Market Turmoil

At present, one must consider the changing market backdrop and chalk out an investment strategy to help generate robust returns. Since the beginning of 2022, markets have been bearing the brunt of macroeconomic and geopolitical ambiguity.

Amid such bearish investor sentiments, a conventional stock picking strategy is useful. One such way is selecting stocks with steady sales growth. Hence, stocks like Tesla, Inc., EPAM Systems, Inc., Unum Group, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and CSX Corp. are worth betting on.

While assessing business growth, revenues are often more monitored than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.

Stable or declining sales growth indicates obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.

Without impressive revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the long term. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continuous bottom-line improvement usually requires robust sales growth.

Nonetheless, sales growth alone doesn't indicate much about a company's future performance. So, taking into consideration a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.

Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screening:

Austin, TX-based Tesla is the market leader in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States, with roughly 70% market share. TSLA operates under two segments: Automotive and Energy Generation & Storage.

Tesla's expected sales growth rate for 2022 is 58.4%. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

EPAM is engaged in providing software product development services, custom application development services, application testing services, application maintenance and support services, infrastructure management services and enterprise information management services.

EPAM Systems' sales are expected to jump 29.4% for 2022. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

Based in Chattanooga, TN, Unum provides financial protection benefit solutions. UNM operates its business through four segments – Unum U.S., Closed Block, Colonial Life and Unum International.

Unum's expected sales growth for 2022 is 1.2%. The company, at present, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

LPL Financial, based in Boston, MA, is a clearing broker-dealer and an investment advisory firm. LPLA acts as an agent for its advisors, on behalf of their clients, by providing access to a broad array of financial products and services.

LPL Financial's expected sales growth rate for 2022 is 10.8%. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

The Googlemanagerhas been outspoken about the harms of Big Tech. Signal is committed to encryption in an industry built on collecting personal data. Also Read:Signal Founder Details Messaging App's Superiority Over Telegram Amid Ukrainian Crisis; Elon Musk Chimes In With His Preferences Non-profit-backed Signal competes against WhatsApp and iMessage, championed by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Whittaker looks to focus on sustaining Signal, which hopes to support itself with small donations from millions of users. ""It costs tens of millions of dollars per year to develop and maintain an app like Signal,"" she said. Whittaker says that the only way to escape technology that makes money off your data is by paying for products that don't. Whittaker, a member of Signal's board since 2020, rose to prominence for worker activism at Google before it ousted her. Most recently, Federal Trade Commissioner Lina Khan tapped Whittaker as a senior adviser on AI. The app experienced a massive spike in downloads last year during a privacy backlash after WhatsApp changed its policy on data collection on user interactions with businesses. Signal currently has 140.9 million downloads across the App Store and Google Play. She said that Signal is not interested in increasing profit or attention on ads but instead creating a network effect of encrypted communication. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) chief Elon Musk praised Signal and recommended that Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) have end-to-end encryption for its direct messages to ensure security. Unlike Signal and Whatsapp, Twitter's direct messages are not end-to-end encrypted.

892,‘Tolkien is turning in his grave’: Elon Musk stokes Bezos rivalry by bashing Amazon’s beta males in ‘Rings of Power’,"Elon Musk added himself to the chorus of critics hating on Amazon Studios’ lavish new action series, The Rings of Power, loosely based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth.

It cost a reported $1 billion to bring the author’s fantasy realm to life, which has now has become a lightning rod for controversy in an ongoing culture war. Viewers on the left and right of the political spectrum are clashing over whether Jeff Bezos’s $1.3 trillion corporate behemoth cynically gender-swapped and race-swapped Tolkien’s characters to make it more commercially accessible to modern audiences.

In a post to Twitter, the Tesla CEO burnished his recent credentials as a growing voice on the political right by taking sides with the critics who take issue with the depiction of beloved characters like Galadriel, portrayed as more of a sword-wielding Valkyrie than the wise forest queen from Peter Jackson’s Oscar-winning cinematic trilogy.

“Almost every male character so far is a coward, a jerk or both,” he posted to Twitter. “Tolkien is turning in his grave.”

Amazon aired the first two episodes of Rings of Power on Friday, which centered on Galadriel, commander of the Northern Armies, bent on exacting vengeance for the death of her brother centuries earlier. By comparison, fellow elf Elrond prefers his life of quiet counsel to King Gil-galad, who attempts to send Galadriel away to avoid any military skirmish with Sauron’s scattered forces.

The debate over Amazon’s Rings of Power began in earnest after showrunners and studio executives argued in Vanity Fair they needed to take liberties when adapting Tolkien characters such as Galadriel and Elrond, since his Middle-earth was badly in need of an update to reflect today’s more modern societies.

Musk’s war on ‘woke’

Musk’s criticism of the series’ depiction of beta male characters is the latest step in the billionaire’s personal political journey following his surprise $44 billion bid for Twitter in April, meant to restore conservative voices to the platform.

Story continues

The Tesla CEO has since openly switched his allegiance to the Republicans, blasted identity politics repeatedly, and attempted to create awareness of what he believes is a crisis for humanity—too few women giving birth.

His recent views are that much more unusual given his fascination with all things modern, all the way up to developing artificially intelligent humanoid robots for menial labor, an endeavor that almost certainly would have offended a deeply religious Roman Catholic like Tolkien.

Musk’s motivation cannot be reduced to trashing an Amazon series simply because it was produced by Jeff Bezos, with whom he maintains a long-running feud. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO had foreshadowed his views earlier in the year, after blaming Netflix’s subscriber loss on “woke” politics that made its programming “unwatchable.”

Netflix has had its own fan backlash after independent filmmaker and perennial Comic-Con guest Kevin Smith adapted a new He-Man series that saw the titular animated character killed off in the first episode with female lead Teela anchoring the story line.

896,"Tesla stock is big buy, Goldman Sachs says","Tesla's stock has been on an electrifying run this summer, and it may not yet be over.

Shares of the EV maker are up 12% in the last three months, handily outperforming the S&P 500's nearly 5% decrease over that time.

Wall Street credits the push higher in Tesla shares to optimism around new government legislation that will support the adoption of EVs in 2023 and beyond. Tesla's strong execution in the first two quarters of the year has also won over the bears.

Despite the stock's rise, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney believes there is more upside to Tesla. Delaney's hot take comes after a meeting with Tesla's head of investor relations Martin Viecha.

Here's what Delaney had to say on Tesla following that pow-wow.

Price Target: $333.33 Rating: Buy (reiterated) Stock price movement assumed: +22%

Takeaway #1: Tesla's costs are headed lower

""Tesla’s automotive cost of goods sold per vehicle fell to about $36,000 in 2021 from over $70,000 in 2017. While this metric increased in the second quarter driven by factory shutdowns, factory start-up costs, and input cost pressure, cost of goods sold per car can trend lower over time as Tesla benefits from the ramp of the Berlin and Austin factories (and the reduced percentage of vehicles coming from Fremont, which is a converted ICE factory with higher costs than Tesla’s purpose-built EV factories), scale, and vehicle platform and battery improvements.""

Takeaway #2: Tesla is a winner from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)

""It’s too soon to say what impact the Inflation Reduction Act will have for Tesla, and a lot will depend on guidance from the government about how the law will be interpreted. However, we note that the IRA does seek to encourage a North America based EV supply chain and Tesla has more local manufacturing than average (with Model 3 and Y recognized as the most American-made vehicles per media sources), and we believe this will be a positive for Tesla to potentially qualify for at least partial credits on some vehicles over time (and Tesla could potentially benefit as well in our view from incentives for solar, batteries, charging, and commercial vehicles).""

Takeaway #3: Tight EV supply supports higher prices, profits

""Tesla believes that consumers will increasingly move toward EVs, similar to other technology inflections (e.g. CRT to LCD TVs, and feature phones to smartphones), but the EV industry could be supply constrained over the intermediate term as new battery/component supply and assembly takes time to ramp up.""

Goldman's investment thesis on Tesla

""We believe that Tesla, given its leadership position in EVs (including its vertical integration and tight coupling of hardware and software, as well as its ecosystem of charging stations and brand), and its focus on clean transportation more broadly (given its solar and storage businesses) is well positioned to capitalize on the long-term shift to EVs. We expect Tesla to expand margins in the intermediate term as it ramps the important Model Y product as well as new factories in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, and in the long-term as it increases its mix of software revenue.""

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44

Shares of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) rose over 5 percent this morning after the company said it would appeal the European Commission’s (EC) latest verdict that barred Illumina from buying biotechnology start-up Grail.

European regulators on Tuesday blocked the deal, saying the acquisition could give Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) a big edge over rivals, besides hampering the ability of its competitors to develop their own cancer detection tests.

898,Tesla stock receives upgrade to Outperform from Wolfe Research,"Yahoo Finance anchors discuss an analyst rating on Tesla stock.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: All right, my play today is Tesla. The stock getting upgraded by Wolfe Research to outperform. The company raising its price target to 360 a share. Now this implies a 33% increase from Tesla's closing price on Friday. The bullish call coming on Tesla comes after the firm also raised its 2025 EV penetration estimate for the US to 20% from 10%.

In his note to clients, the analyst wrote that the Inflation Reduction Act is the most, quote, ""consequential development"" for the US auto industry that we have seen in a very long time. So Tesla shares moving to the upside today, Dave, since the start of the year. The stock still off about 22%. But more and more analysts now becoming a little bit more bullish on Tesla on the heels of that new act that Congress just passed.

DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it is interesting, probably the biggest winner other than the solar industry of the IRA. And Master Musk never one to waste a moment on Twitter, putting out last night, order a Tesla Powerwall battery for blackout protection. Now the Powerwall usually not part of the investor story, but he certainly starts, as always, a very interesting conversation here because they are looking at rolling blackouts in California, as their power grid struggles to keep up with the heat.

And then this ties right back to EVs because we've discussed this before, California goes all EV by 2035, and yet doesn't have the power grid to yet support that or the chargers. So it really goes hand in hand, and you can't help but wonder how many of those Powerwalls will spread around California. And Elon is the winner of both of those stories.",2022-09-06T19:56:32+00:00,2022-09-06

Invesco QQQ Trust is an exchange traded fund trading under the ticker ‘QQQ’ on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The ETF tracks the NASDAQ-100 Index. The index includes the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ based on their market capitalization. The index, as well as the ETF, are rebalanced quarterly based on the respective changes while the reconstitution is carried out on an annual basis.

Invesco QQQ Trust is heavily weighted towards companies in the technology sector as nearly half of its portfolio weight is concentrated across the information technology sector companies. The tech stocks picked for this list accounted for more than half of the ETF’s portfolio weight as of Q2 2022. The fund has been in regulation since late 1999 and has generated returns of 8.26%, closely following the underlying index and significantly exceeding the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russel 3000 Index.

First half of 2022 witnessed a significant decline in the market capitalization of companies in almost every sector due to the macroeconomic environment and increasing inflationary pressures. Speaking about the positives for Q3 2022, Ryan T. McCormack and Paul J. Schroeder wrote in the recent Invesco QQQ quarterly report:

“One positive development is that valuations, arguably some of the biggest areas of pushback over the last two years, have declined considerably. Valuation of the Nasdaq 100 index (the index QQQ tracks finished the quarter with a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 24.16). Looking through a longer-term lens, this P/E level has not been seen since the early days of the pandemic (Q2 2020) and may represent an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to large-cap growth at the most attractive valuations in the past two years.”

Methodology

For this article, we picked the top nine holdings of Invesco QQQ Trust and sorted them based on the number of hedge funds holding long positions in these stocks according to Insider Monkey data gathered for 895 hedge funds, as of the end of June.

9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Percentage of Invesco QQQ Trust’s Portfolio: 3.90%

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72

Here is what GMO LLC has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“To put the demand growth for clean energy materials into perspective, let’s look at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). At its Battery Day last year, Tesla projected three terawatt hours of lithium-ion battery capacity needed in 2030 for the EVs and storage they expect to produce. To reach this target, Tesla alone would gobble up approximately 75% of the world’s current nickel production and four times the world’s current lithium production. These numbers are astounding enough, but when one considers that EVs currently represent just 15% of global nickel demand and about 45% of lithium demand and that Tesla will likely be producing only a small proportion of the world’s EVs in 2030, the implications are staggering. Clean energy materials companies will make a lot more money in the decades to come than they ever have both because they will be selling a lot more metric tons of material and because there are certain to be shortages where supply can’t keep up with the rapidly growing demand.”

913,Elon Musk $258 billion Dogecoin lawsuit expands,"By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The $258 billion racketeering lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of running a pyramid scheme to support the cryptocurrency Dogecoin has expanded, adding seven new investor plaintiffs and six new defendants including his tunnel construction business Boring Co.

According to an amended complaint filed on Tuesday night in Manhattan federal court, Musk, his electric car company Tesla Inc, his space tourism company SpaceX, Boring and others intentionally drove up the price of Dogecoin more than 36,000% over two years and then let it crash.

By doing so, the defendants ""profited tens of billions of dollars"" at other Dogecoin investors' expense, while knowing all along that the currency lacked intrinsic value and that its value ""depended solely on marketing,"" the complaint said.

Tesla, SpaceX and Boring did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. Tesla disbanded its media relations department in 2020.

The original lawsuit was filed in June.

Shortly afterward, Musk, the world's richest person, tweeted that he would ""keep supporting Dogecoin,"" and in an interview said ""people that work around the factory at SpaceX or Tesla"" asked him for that support, the amended complaint said.

Other new defendants include the Dogecoin Foundation, which calls itself a nonprofit providing governance and support for Dogecoin. It could not immediately be reached for comment.

The $258 billion in damages is triple the estimated decline in Dogecoin's market value since May 2021.

That was around the time Musk, playing a fictitious financial expert on a ""Weekend Update"" segment of NBC's ""Saturday Night Live,"" called Dogecoin ""a hustle.""

Dogecoin traded at about 6 cents on Wednesday, down from around 74 cents in May 2021.

The case is Johnson et al v. Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-05037.

""Yes, I'm talking to them,"" Champagne said, in response to a question about reports of Tesla looking to build a factory in Canada. ""I'm talking also to all the automakers around the world.""

Consider Warren Buffett, arguably the most successful investor of all time. During the bull market of the past decade, Buffett was harshly and frequently criticized for not buying any stocks or companies even as his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B), accumulated a cash hoard that, at its peak, totaled $149 billion.

However, during the bull run, Buffett repeatedly complained that stock prices were overvalued and that he didn’t see any deals to be had. But this year, when the benchmark S&P 500 index suffered its worst first half performance since 1970, Buffett bought more than $50 billion worth of stocks — the most he has purchased since the financial crisis of 2008-09.

Buffett took new positions in companies such as Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY), and beefed up his existing holdings in companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), finding high-quality stocks to buy on the dip while prices were low and valuations were cheap.

If there’s one thing Buffett doesn’t want to miss it is an opportunity to buy great stocks that are on sale. Other investors should follow suit and also take advantage of this year’s market downturn. Here are seven stocks that you should buy on the dip. If you don’t, you’ll be kicking yourself later on.

GOOGL Alphabet $108.50 AAPL Apple $155.25 F Ford $15.32 NVDA Nvidia $135.80 NKE Nike $107.75 DIS Disney $109.66 SBUX Starbucks $87.88

At the end of June, one share of technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cost nearly $1,800.00. Today investors can buy the stock for a little over $105 per share. Two things have made the parent company of search engine Google’s stock more affordable. The first was a 20-for-1 stock split that occurred in July. The second is the fact that GOOGL stock has declined 27% this year as the market has turned south. The end result is that investors can now buy this top-shelf technology stock for $106.27 per share.

Consider also that Alphabet looks to be fairly valued right now, with the stock’s price-earnings ratio sitting at 20, its lowest level in a decade. Add in continued strong earnings and a likely rebound in online advertising at its flagship Google search engine, and buying GOOGL stock at its current levels seems like a no-brainer. The current median price target on the stock among 44 professional analysts who cover the company is $140, versus the stock’s current level of just under  $110..

In the past five years, Alphabet’s stock has gained 126%.

Another heavyweight tech stock that is on sale right now is consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). As I mentioned earlier, Warren Buffett has used the downturn of AAPL stock this year to bolster his holdings.

Buffett’s company –Berkshire Hathaway — bought $600 million worth of Apple shares in Q1 when AAPL was trading near $150 a share.  The current value of Berkshire Hathaway’s AAPL stock is $141.28 billion. The shares are worth more than any other single stock owned by Berkshire.

AAPL stock has fallen to $155 recently. In 2022, the stock has declined about 15% and looks like a bargain at its current levels. The company’s P/E ratio appears to be fair at 25.7, and Apple is one of the few mega-cap technology stocks that actually pays a dividend, as it currently yields 0.60%.

Among the 37 analysts who cover Apple, the median price target on the stock is $185.00. Apple’s share price has gained 289% in the last five years.

Ford’s (NYSE:F) stock is down 26% so far this year and trading at just $15 a share. The stock is now 42% below its 52-week high of $25.87 a share. While the share price should be attractive to most retail investors, consider also that Ford’s stock looks woefully undervalued with a current P/E ratio of only 5.22, well below the average P/E among S&P 500  stocks of 19.83. Investors should also like that Ford pays an outsized dividend that currently yields 4%, also much better than the average dividend yield among S&P 500 companies of 1.69%.

If a beaten down stock price, low P/E ratio, and high dividend yield aren’t enticing enough, consider also that Ford is aggressively, and successfully, transforming itself into an electric-vehicle company. In an effort to catch-up to industry leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford has announced that it will spend $50 billion on its electric vehicle transition through 2026, up from a previous commitment of $30 billion.

Ford has also moved to separate its EV unit from its combustion engine business, a decision that has been applauded by analysts. F stock has gained 32% in the past five years, including a 16% gain over the last 12-months.

The stocks of microchip and semiconductor makers have been brutalized this year as investors flee from specialty tech securities and head for the relative safety of blue-chip consumer staples. Case in point: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose share price is down 55% so far this year and trading at $136 a share. The stock is 60% below its 52-week high.

Investors who are in it for the long haul should take full advantage of the downturn in NVDA stock and buy its shares hand-over-fist. The  California-based company remains a leader in the chip and semiconductor space, and its products are used to power everything from supercomputers to artificial intelligence.

The company’s share price has been knocked lower this year after it was forced to pre-announce earning and lower its guidance due to ongoing supply chain problems and softening consumer demand for its chips that are used to power personal computers and video game consoles. NVDA stock also took a gut punch after the U.S. government restricted the sale of some of its chips to China, citing national security concerns.

But despite these challenges, Nvidia’s long-term outlook is strong. In spite of this year’s plunge, the stock remains up 231% over the past five years, and the median price target on the stock is currently $207.50.

The shares of athletic footwear and apparel brand Nike (NYSE:NKE) have been in investor jail for the better part of a year now. The Oregon-based company’s stock price slump 35% in the past 12-months, sliding down to their current level of $107.75 per share. NKE stock barely budged during the July market rally and it has been trading around the $105 mark since May of this year. Investors have sold off the stock on concerns about its manufacturing base in Southeast Asia, excess supplies in the U.S., and slowing demand within China. However, none of these issues appears to have impacted Nike’s earnings.

At the end of June, the company reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings that trounced analysts’ average  expectations, announcing earnings per share of 90 cents compared to the 81 cents that was expected, on average, among analysts. Its revenues totaled $12.23 billion versus the $12.06 billion that was expected.

While its sales have declined in China, Nike has managed to make up the shortfall with increased sales in its home market of the U.S. and elsewhere around the globe. The company continues to expand its digital and online sales channels. The median price target on the stock is $129 a share.

Speaking of companies that delivered better-than-expected quarterly prints, Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) just delivered stellar financial results, beating analysts’ average estimates on the top and bottom lines and successfully growing its streaming subscribers. Plus, Disney theme parks, hotels and cruises are back to operating at full capacity for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, and the company has had several hit movies released in theaters this year, including Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Death on the Nile. Yet despite all these successes, DIS stock is trading 40% lower than where it was a year ago at $109.66 per share.

Apparently investors remain reticent about the growing competition in the streaming space, as well as the potential impact that upcoming price hikes could have on Disney+ subscribers. Plus, some analysts have raised red flags about the $33 billion that Disney is spending on content for its streaming platform this year.

And uncertainty looms regarding what this fall and winter will bring regarding Covid-19 outbreaks and the potential for renewed lockdowns that could impact Disney’s theme parks around the world. Worries aside, investors with a long-term horizon might want to buy DIS stock while it’s on sale. The median price target on the stock is $140.

Starbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy

Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com

Seattle-based coffee retailer Starbuck’s stock got kicked down a few rungs this past spring when interim CEO Howard Schultz announced that he was suspending the company’s $20 billion share buyback program, and as several of the company’s workers around the U.S. moved to unionize themselves. All the drama has conspired to send SBUX stock down 25% on the year to its current price of $87.88 a share. However, after months of turmoil and strife, Starbucks looks to be turning a page by announcing the appointment of a new permanent CEO and the realignment of its retail network.

Starbucks just named Laxman Narasimhan as its new leader. He most recently served as CEO of health and hygiene company Reckitt Benckiser (NYSE:RKT), which owns brands such as Lysol and Mucinex. He will join Starbucks in October and learn about the company before assuming the CEO job next April.

Until then, Howard Schultz will remain the interim CEO. Schultz will also remain on Starbucks’ board of directors after Narasimhan succeeds him in the top job. New management could be just the thing to help the ailing Starbucks. Analysts’ median price target on SBUX stock is $91 a share, for 8% potential upside.

922,UPDATE 2-Tesla triples deliveries of China-made cars after upgrade in Shanghai plant,"(Adds details, background)

SHANGHAI, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Tesla sold 76,965 Chinese-made vehicles in August, nearly triple its sales from a month ago, as it quickened deliveries after ramping up output at its Shanghai plant.

The U.S. carmaker exported 42,463 Model 3s and Model Ys from China last month, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said. In July, it sold 28,217 vehicles and exported 19,756.

After a scheduled upgrade disrupted most production in July, Tesla ramped up output at the Shanghai plant in August, defying heatwaves and COVID curbs that hit its suppliers in the southwest region.

Battery maker CATL's Yibin plant, which mainly supplies battery cells to Tesla Shanghai, had to shut part of its operations due to local power restriction policies in mid-August.

The output ramp-up enabled Tesla to accelerate deliveries of the Model 3 and Model Y electric cars to customers especially in China, where it faces more competition from local rivals.

It slashed delivery waiting time for its two best-selling models to a maximum of 14 weeks in China, while buyers of the rear-wheel drive Model Y can pick up the SUV in a month after placing the order, according to Tesla's Chinese website.

China's overall passenger car sales in August jumped 28.4% from a year earlier to 1.9 million, the CPCA said.

After a difficult start to the year that has seen China's economy slow amid COVID lockdowns, auto sales in China have rebounded thanks to government incentives and tax breaks.

Exports of passenger vehicles jumped 77.5% last month, bucking an overall export growth slowdown, CPCA said.

Sales of electric cars accounted for 28% of the total in August and rose by 111.2%, it added.

BYD led the electric vehicle producers with 173,977 cars delivered in August, while Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto delivered 10,677, 9,578 and 4,571 vehicles, respectively.

As the stock market runs red, investors are wary about spending copious amounts of money and making huge investments amid such macro uncertainty. On the other hand, investors with limited money but high appetite for risk also look for stocks with growth potential. This is where the demand for penny stocks skyrockets. Penny stocks, with proper growth catalysts and funding, have the potential for exponential growth. These stocks can trade higher over time, realizing significant gains for stakeholders.

The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow have all plunged from their highs, effectively concluding a multi-week rally. The stagnant market sentiment has led many investors to seek alpha elsewhere.

Downdraft Energy Technology Cost Comparisons of Renewable Energy Tech w/ KiNRG Arizona Energy Campus & Ancillary Economic Benefits PPA Agreements & Third-Party Sponsors (Bondi, etc.) Going Global

About KiNRG:

Over the past decade KiNRG, Inc., the “Company” has used its resources to develop and refine a means to generate massive amounts of carbon free electricity with no residual waste.

Originating from many man years of studies done at the Technion University in Israel decades ago, but without the advantages of today’s meteorological data capture capability, sophisticated software modeling, modern construction techniques, and enhanced construction materials, the Technion was unable to facilitate an economic model that was stable, viable, and sustainable. Our organization completed the refinements of this wonderful beginning, tested, prototyped and patented the finished generating facility capable of producing energy that is significantly more efficient, cost effective, and reliable than either traditional solar or wind. A clean power source that does not degrade over years, that is safe for wildlife and birds, and complimentary to the ecosystem has arrived.

KiNRG, Inc. has worked diligently with qualified and experienced management to bring this novel clean energy solution to market. The efforts have been supported by large successful companies in conjunction with academia. Consultants to the Company include department heads from universities including N.C. State University (Physicist), Penn State University (Meteorology), Georgia Tech (Aerospace & CFD), University of Oklahoma (Meteorology), and Milwaukee School of Engineering (Fluid Dynamics & CFD).

946,Musk Says SpaceX Discussed iPhone Satellite Service With Apple,"(Bloomberg) -- SpaceX held talks with Apple Inc. about using Starlink connectivity for the iPhone maker’s new satellite features, Elon Musk said.

The companies have had “promising conversations,” SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Musk said Thursday on Twitter, adding that Apple’s iPhone team is “super smart.” It was unclear if the talks were ongoing.

The comments came a day after Apple announced Emergency SOS via Satellite, which will allow iPhone 14 users to ping emergency services using satellite networks in areas without standard cellular reception. For the service, Apple partnered with Globalstar Inc. to power the satellite infrastructure, the network provider said in a regulatory filing Wednesday.

Apple and SpaceX, whose full name is Space Exploration Technologies Corp., didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Last month, Musk’s SpaceX and US wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc. preempted Apple’s long-anticipated announcement by revealing that phone users on T-Mobile’s network would be able to tap into SpaceX satellites to send text messages in areas without cellular connectivity. The collaboration is dependent on SpaceX launching an upgraded version of its Starlink satellites, known as Version 2.

That partnership, which won’t launch until the end of next year at the earliest, will differ from Apple’s feature in that it will allow for communication between consumers. Apple’s short length satellite texting service is only designed to message emergency responders, the company said Wednesday.

The satellite infrastructure will allow integration with Apple’s Find My app, allowing hikers and explorers to be more accurately tracked by friends in areas where GPS or cellular services may not normally work.

Satellite Investment

Apple’s feature is set to launch in November and will be free for two years. The company didn’t say how much it would cost after that initial period. Apple is investing hundreds of millions of dollars into Globalstar’s satellite infrastructure, the company said. The T-Mobile and Starlink feature will be free.

Story continues

Starlink is SpaceX’s ambitious plan to create a constellation of thousands of satellites, in order to beam broadband internet coverage to the Earth below. The company has roughly 3,000 satellites in orbit at the moment and recently said it has more than 400,000 subscribers.

Musk’s companies have never collaborated with Apple, though he did confirm in 2020 that he attempted to sell Tesla Inc. to the technology giant during some of the automaker’s darkest days. Apple CEO Tim Cook later said he had never spoken with Musk about such a deal.

951,Tesla considering lithium refinery in Texas,"Sept 9 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is considering setting up a lithium refinery on the gulf coast of Texas, as it looks to secure supply of the key component used in batteries amid surging demand for electric vehicles.

The potential battery-grade lithium hydroxide refining facility will process, refine and manufacture battery materials, Tesla said in an application filed with the Texas Comptroller's Office on August 22.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has tweeted previously that Tesla might have to enter the mining and refining industry directly at scale as lithium prices surge.

If Tesla's regulatory permit applications are approved, construction could begin in the fourth quarter of 2022 and will reach commercial production by the end of 2024.

Under the plan, Tesla will ship the final product from the refinery by truck and rail to various Tesla battery manufacturing sites supporting the supply chain for large-scale and electric vehicle batteries, the electric car maker said it its application.

Tesla is also evaluating a competing site in Louisiana for the project, it said.

Securing a steady supply of battery components is critical for Tesla as it faces mounting competition from rivals. The company also faces the challenge of significantly boosting production in the second half of the year, after China's lockdowns hit production.

952,"Tesla considering lithium refinery in Texas, seeks tax relief","(Reuters) -Tesla Inc is considering setting up a lithium refinery on the gulf coast of Texas, as it looks to secure supply of the key component used in batteries amid surging demand for electric vehicles.

The potential battery-grade lithium hydroxide refining facility, which Tesla touted as the first of its kind in North America, will process ""raw ore material into a usable state for battery production"", the company said in an application filed with the Texas Comptroller's Office.

A decision to invest in Texas will also be based on the ability to obtain relief on local property taxes, Tesla said.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has previously said that Tesla may have to enter the mining and refining industry directly at scale as lithium prices surge.

Musk has also been vocal about the need for more players in the lithium refining industry. ""You can't lose. It's licensed to print money,"" he had said at the company's second-quarter earnings call.

Securing a steady supply of battery components is seen critical for Tesla as it faces fierce competition in the fast-growing market for electric cars.

If approved, construction could begin in the fourth quarter of 2022 and would reach commercial production by the end of 2024, Tesla said in the application dated Aug. 22.

Under the plan, Tesla will ship the final product from the refinery by trucks and rail to various Tesla battery manufacturing sites supporting the supply chain for large-scale and electric vehicle batteries.

Tesla, whose shares rose 1.4% in premarket trading, also said it would use less hazardous reagents and create usable byproducts, compared with the conventional process.

LITHIUM SCRAMBLE

Lithium prices have skyrocketed this year due to surging demand from the auto sector. China remains the world's largest lithium processor, though proposed rival projects in the United States and European Union have faced a range of setbacks.

If Tesla's plan goes ahead, the carmaker could become the first in the sector to invest directly in lithium refining as automakers scramble to stitch up deals with miners and refiners.

""Car-makers are trying to ensure they have control over the supply of lithium, hedging for any geopolitical situation that might arise in future where the supply is disrupted,"" said Arpit Agarwal, director at venture capital firm Blume Ventures, which has backed EV startups such as Euler Motors and Yulu.

Tesla also stands to gain from lower logistics costs as well as incentives it may get from the U.S. government, he added.

Battery makers are also looking to increase production in the United States, where a shift toward EVs could increase as the country implements stricter regulation and tightens tax credit eligibility.

Tesla itself signed a five-year supply deal with Australia's Liontown Resources earlier this year, while rival EV makers Stellantis and Byd have invested in miners around the world.

956,BMW Unveils Plans to Use Cylindrical Batteries in New EVs From 2025,"By Scott Kanowsky

Investing.com -- Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (ETR:BMWG) has announced that it will use cylindrical battery cells to power its new electric vehicles set to debut in 2025, in a bid to accelerate charging times and increase the cars' driving range.

The German luxury carmaker said it has already awarded production contracts worth ""multibillion"" euros to China's CATL and EVE Energy. Both of these firms will manufacture the batteries at four gigafactories in China and Europe with a total annual capacity of up to 20 gigawatts hours, BMW added.

Two further sites are planned in the United States and Mexico, although BMW has yet to find a partner for these projects.

BMW called the cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells a ""huge leap in technology"" that will utilize more nickel and silicon to improve charging speed and driving range by up to 30%. Meanwhile, energy density will also be improved by over 20%, which will cut costs almost in half when compared to previous battery generations.

The company also pledged to bring manufacturing expenses for EVs down to the ""same level as vehicles with state-of-the-art combustion-engine technology.""

The shift to cylindrical battery cells, and away from the rectangular-shaped prismatic batteries it currently uses, follows a similar move by rival Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Supporters of cylindrical batteries say its format - which is larger than prismatic batteries - can raise energy density and, in turn, be more cost-effective.

Shares in BMW traded higher after the announcement on Friday.

The move comes as prices soared on other EV models. The surging lithium and nickel prices forced the automakers to bump the EV prices. Peer Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) explored setting up a lithium refinery on the gulf coast of Texas to secure its supply amid surging demand for EVs, Reuter reports. GM's electric Chevy Equinox will go on sale in the fall of 2023 and claims a total driving range of 300 miles on a single charge. The gas-powered Equinox, a compact SUV, is GM's No. 2 seller in the U.S., behind the Chevy Silverado pickup truck. U.S. car shoppers have been paying sharply higher EV prices amid an influx of new entries, with few choices below $35,000. ""We wanted to get into the heart of the market,"" said Doug Houlihan, the executive engineer in charge of the electric Equinox program. ""The more volume we can get, the lower we can get the price."" GM's higher-end models are likely to go well beyond $40,000. The Equinox's debut follows GM's recall of its last affordable EV offering, the Chevy Bolt, over problems with battery fires. GM subsequently slashed its prices to boost sales. Volkswagen AG's (OTC: VWAGY) ID.4 electric starts around $37,500. Kia's EV6 and Toyota Motor Corp's (NYSE: TM) bZ4X have base prices of just over $40,000, while Tesla's Model 3 sedan starts at around $47,000.

""The shift towards electromobility, but also government decisions, are driving demand for electric vehicles,"" SVOLT Chief Executive Hongxin Yang said. ""SVOLT is responding to this market dynamic with steady expansion by building additional local capacities.""

SVOLT in 2020 announced investments of up to 2 billion euros ($2.01 billion) to build a cell production facility as well as a module and pack factory in the south-western German state of Saarland with a planned production capacity of 24 GWh.

965,10 Best Autonomous Vehicle ETFs and Stocks to Invest In,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best autonomous vehicle ETFs and stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of these stocks and the AV sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Autonomous Vehicle ETFs and Stocks to Invest In.

With continuing development and innovation in emerging markets, alongside the rise of new technology, several industries across the globe have begun to be revolutionized. The automotive industry is no exception to this revolution, with the rise of autonomous driving and electrification. Traditional car makers are not the only ones with a stake in this new trend of autonomous driving either, as many tech companies are currently investing in, or setting up subsidiaries overseeing, autonomous driving.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) are two examples of the above. These tech giants are diving into the AV sector just as fast as companies like Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV), which is originally a traditional automotive parts manufacturer. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been dedicated to investing in the AV sector since 2009, and has continued to research autonomous driving over the years.  The automotive industry as a whole is thus benefitting from this rising interest in autonomous driving. With billions being invested in rising technological developments in this industry, the automotive revenue pool's additional revenue will increase by about 30% to $1.5 trillion by 2030, as noted by McKinsey & Company in a study on the automotive revolution. The study also mentioned that after major technological and regulatory issues surrounding AVs are resolved, as many as 15% of new cars sold in 2030 will be fully autonomous.

While autonomous driving may seem unrealistic and farfetched to some, major tech behemoths such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have continued to invest billions of dollars into the research and design of autonomous vehicles. According to CNBC this May, the AV market is expected to make up 12% of all new car registrations by 2030. In 2021, equity funding in autonomous vehicles reached $12 billion, showcasing a 50% increase in investment when compared to 2020. In the US, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary company, Waymo, was the leading investor with $5.5 billion being poured into AV development and research. Many startups in the AV sector today have been supported by major traditional automakers looking to make autonomous driving a reality in the near future. Motional is one example of such a startup set up last year in a joint venture with Hyundai and pilots with Lyft.

The interest and investment in the AV sector have continued well into 2022. This July, according to Reuters, the US company State Farm joined with the Japanese Tokio Marine to pledge $111 million in funding for the AV tech startup May Mobility. Both auto insurers from the two countries have begun to provide crucial support to the AV sector with this move. The $111 million figure will aid May Mobility in its continuing work with Toyota Motor Corp. The startup has commented that it aims to rid cars of human drivers by next year, through its commercial operation to make autonomous vehicles widely available on the market.

Aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies, components, and wiring. The large exposure of APTV to EVs should lead to long-term value as EVs continue their growth, boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near-historic highs.”

966,Rivian Gets a $3 Billion Boost From Making Mercedes a Frenemy,"(Bloomberg) --

Most Read from Bloomberg

Charles Becomes King as the Face of a Nation Changes Double Rainbow Appears Over Buckingham Palace as Crowd Gathers to Mourn Queen Queen Elizabeth’s Doctors Are Concerned for Her Health Queen Elizabeth II, Britain’s Longest-Reigning Monarch, Dies at 96 Ukraine Army’s Breakthrough in North Threatens Russian Grip

Rivian just added almost $3 billion to its market capitalization in a day, and all it took was a fairly bare-bones deal with a new frenemy.

The upstart and Mercedes-Benz will join forces to build big electric vans in Europe “in a few years,” the two revealed Thursday, sending Rivian shares soaring 11%, their biggest jump in four months. Thin as the announcement was on detail, it sent an obvious signal. Yes, this young plug-in pickup maker is having trouble ramping up production, but one of the most storied manufacturers in the world still sees real potential.

A friendship with a competitor is nothing new for Rivian. One of the reasons investors were so high on the company when it was preparing to go public a year ago was the way General Motors and Ford raced one another to strike a strategic partnership with the up-and-comer around the time it was in the process of securing major backing from Amazon. One of Ford’s senior-most executives at the time later bragged about “stealing” a promising investment from its Detroit-based nemesis at the 11th hour.

There’s another “blast from the past” element to this from Mercedes’s perspective, as Baird analyst Ben Kallo put it in a note to clients Friday. Daimler played a critical role in helping Tesla get off the ground by acquiring a stake during the great financial crisis and buying drivetrains from the company to power Mercedes hatchbacks. Elon Musk has described that deal as fundamental to Tesla surviving its early struggles.

There’s a lot left to unpack about this new tie-up — how and why it came together, what it means and who wins and loses. Here are a few thoughts and questions to ponder:

Story continues

Conserving Cash

In the months before and after its blockbuster initial public offering in November, Rivian was furiously hiring and building out its sales and service operations to support its growth ambitions. Those have been held up by the company’s plant in Normal, Illinois, which isn’t assembling nearly as many R1T trucks, R1S SUVs and Amazon delivery vehicles as hoped. Supply chain woes are plaguing all of the auto industry but hitting inexperienced companies particularly hard.

While Rivian still had $15.5 billion in the bank at the end of June, management has made several moves lately to be more capital-efficient amid rising costs and concern about a global downturn. The joint venture with Mercedes will be a cheaper way to enter the European market and boost the company’s credibility with suppliers and prospective customers that might otherwise have been skittish.

A lot of Rivian’s cash is also already earmarked for other expensive projects. It has yet to break ground on a $5 billion factory near Atlanta, and executives have said the amount the company has on hand offers just enough runway to get to the start of production of the mid-price car to be built at that plant by 2025.

Burden-sharing with Mercedes may also reflect how difficult it’s become for companies in the EV sector to raise capital, D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Shlisky wrote in an email. In a July memo to staff about cutting 6% of Rivian’s workforce, CEO RJ Scaringe noted that global capital markets were tightening. “We need to be able to continue to grow and scale without additional financing in this macro environment,” he wrote.

Ford Ties

After Ford worked so hard years ago to beat GM to the punch in linking up with Rivian, their relationship has taken many curious twists and turns.

First, Joe Hinrichs, the former Ford president who played a leading role in brokering the partnership, abruptly retired and left Rivian’s board. Soon thereafter, the companies called off plans that had been announced three months earlier to jointly develop Lincoln’s first fully electric model. Alexandra Ford English, the great-great granddaughter of founder Henry Ford, replaced Hinrichs as a Rivian director, but didn’t stay on for long. Yet another replacement stepped down leading up to Rivian’s IPO, leaving Ford without a board seat.

Ford and Rivian have been relatively mum about their future together. Now the former, which still owns a 9.6% stake in the latter, may end up with more formidable competition in the commercial vehicle business that is a huge point of pride and emphasis for Ford CEO Jim Farley. The automaker announced plans just this week to start selling the electric version of its best-selling European delivery van, the E-Transit Custom, roughly a year from now.

Upside for Amazon

What Rivian, Mercedes and Ford all have in common is Amazon.

The e-commerce giant has a contract with Rivian for 100,000 electric vans due to be delivered by the end of the decade. It also buys vans from Ford, Mercedes and others. Given the size of Amazon’s global fleet and its ambitious sustainability targets, it has to look beyond just Rivian for electric last-mile delivery options.

Amazon has exclusive rights to Rivian’s delivery vehicles for four years after receiving its first one, as well as the right of first refusal to buy its vans for two years after that. It’s surely hoping the Rivian-Mercedes deal will mean more electric van availability, and ideally at lower costs.

Carry On

Rivian seeking to establish production in Europe is not a surprise: executives have had their eye on the market for some time.

The company scouted locations for a potential factory in locations including the UK, Germany and Hungary, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg in February last year. Rivian opting to set up shop with Mercedes somewhere in central or eastern Europe will be a letdown to those who courted the company.

In one indication of just how eager leaders were to land the investment, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson tried to woo Scaringe himself, Sky News reported late last year.

The announcement follows Stellantis Dodge’s recent unveiling of the Dodge Charger Daytona SRT, a high-performance EV concept. The vehicle has improved performance measures like enhanced aerodynamics and an 800V powertrain with four-wheel drive. The Dodge Charger is expected to be a breakthrough in the world of battery-electric vehicles (BEV).

Earlier in the year, Stellantis’ Ram broke the news that it was working on an all-electric full-size pickup truck for which production is slated to commence in 2024. Ram will share the details of the much-awaited Ram Revolution EV news in November. The brand aims to serve the next generation of Ram customers with a range of products that caters to real-world demands. The RAM electric pickup truck will be designed on a new STLA Frame architecture that will be able to support a mighty 500-mile driving range. The anticipated vehicle promises more range, power, productivity and convenience.

The Chrysler brand has also announced that it will launch its first BEV by 2025 and offer an all-electric Chrysler vehicle lineup by 2028.

This recent announcement is part of its sustainable transformation to emerge as the world's leading electrified SUV brand.

In July 2021, Stellantis announced ambitious plans to invest more than €30 billion between 2021 and 2025 in electrification and software development.

It aims to cover 40% of sales in the United States and 70% of sales in Europe from low-emission vehicles by 2030. It also targets 50% of passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States and 100% of passenger car BEV sales mix in Europe by the end of this decade.

Stellantis has been focused on expediting its electrification plans in recent months.

It has launched the Dare Forward 2030 plan to aid its transition to a carbon net-zero entity by 2038, with a 50% reduction by 2030. The auto giant aims to double net revenues to $335 billion annually by 2030 and maintain double-digit profit margins as it looks to ramp up efforts to bring electrified versions of its cars. The Dodge muscle car and the Ram pickup had been mentioned in the plan. It also intends to have more than 75 BEVs and reach global annual BEV sales of 5 million vehicles by 2030.

It is remarkable that Stellantis, with an impressive portfolio of 14 renowned brands, is set to rev up the electrification journey with exhilarating product offerings. The recent development by the Jeep brand is in line with STLA’s vision of an electrified future.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22

Redburn analyst Tony Jones improved his ratings for PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) from ""Neutral"" to ""Buy"" on Tuesday, September 6, 2022. Jones thinks the underperformance by paints and coatings stocks is over and they are set to make a rebound.

Story continues

PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) is a leading supplier of paints and coatings. The company was founded way back in 1883, making it one of the oldest players in the markets it operates. Moreover, it has decades-long experience in progressing in tough times like these.

Earlier this year, investment management firm ClearBridge Investments also discussed PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) in its first-quarter 2022 investor letter, stating:

""While commodities-exposed areas of the materials sector such as mining and steel fared well in the quarter, we tend to have less direct exposure to commodities across our portfolio. Holdings like paint and coating company PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) that use natural gas and oil related products as feedstock into their products faced sharp input cost escalation, driving meaningful margin compression, which was not well-received by investors. While negative in the short term, we remain confident that the company will be able to adjust pricing accordingly and recover margins over the medium term.""

Like PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG), analysts also raised their ratings for Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), in September.

8. Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25

7. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26

Goldman Sachs turned bullish on First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) on Wednesday, September 7, 2022. The research firm upgraded the solar technology company from ""Sell"" to ""Buy"" and lifted its price target from $60 per share to $172 per share.

Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee thinks First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) would benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). First Solar shares rose over three percent in pre-market trading Thursday, September 8, following the upgrade.

Overall, First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) shares have jumped more than 30 percent over the last month. Much of that gain has been attributed to the approval of the climate-focused IRA bill in August. The IRA bill includes a hefty amount of $369 billion primarily for reducing carbon footprint.

Following the bill's approval, First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) announced that it would build a new panel facility in the U.S. for roughly $1.2 billion. The announcement was intended to avail new tax credits from the government under IRA.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Jim Farley will go to Las Vegas next week to roll the dice on a strategy to convince dealers to cut as much as $2,000 from the cost of delivering an electric vehicle to a customer.

Ford has told dealers that one key topic for the meetings will be a discussion of new agreements that would govern how dealers sell Ford's expanding lineup of electric vehicles.

Farley told analysts in July that Ford needs to cut $2,000 a vehicle out of selling and distribution costs to be competitive with Tesla Inc and other electric vehicle startups that sell directly to consumers without franchised dealers.

About a third of those savings could come from what Farley called a ""low inventory model,"" where customers order a vehicle and Ford ships it to the customer, rather than stocking vehicles on dealer lots for weeks or months.

""We think that's about -- worth maybe $600, $700 in our system,"" Farley told analysts. Tesla can also adjust prices rapidly on its website, and keep most of the gain from a price increase.

Ford declined to comment other than to say “we are excited to meet next week with our North America dealers to grow and win together.”

Dealers said they expect Ford to outline minimum investments for charging stations and other equipment to support electric vehicle customers.

A key question will be how quickly dealers will be required to install chargers, which dealers said can cost as much as $500,000.

""The manufacturers so far have let us scale into it and I think Ford will hopefully do the same thing. You just can't say, 'Listen, we're going to sell 2 million electric cars five years from now and we expect you to put in five superchargers,'"" said Rhett Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford, a large dealership in Columbus, Ohio.

Tesla's success at selling electric vehicles without franchised dealers is putting pressure on all established automakers to overhaul their retail networks.

A shift by Ford to a Tesla-style build to order system could come with caps on the profit margins dealers can earn on a new vehicle sale, some dealers said.

""I see dealer margins still being very competitive, but they are going to shift,"" Farley said in July. Ford intends to put more emphasis on selling products and services after the initial vehicle sale, he said.

Dealers said state franchise laws could give dealers leverage to resist efforts by Ford to set fixed prices or fixed fees for delivering electric vehicles.

Rival General Motors Co last week said it would offer buyouts to U.S. Buick dealers who did not want to make required investments as the brand shifted to an all-electric lineup. GM has already spent $274 million to reduce the ranks of U.S. Cadillac dealers.

Josh Sloan, the general manager who oversees two Ford stores and one Lincoln store for Michigan's LaFontaine Automotive Group, said his company is prepared to spend what it takes to shift to electric vehicles.

""I was surprised there weren't higher standards from Ford sooner,"" Sloan said. ""We're moving into this really fast. If you're not all-in, you're going to lose.""

973,"Tesla watch: New leadership at Gigafactory, lithium refinery proposed","Tesla (TSLA) stock is climbing today in midday trade, up over 2% and up nearly 10% for the week. Here are two big stories driving shares today:

Tesla shuffles staff at Giga Nevada, reveals new data

In leaked audio of a Thursday meeting obtained by CNBC, Tesla revealed it has reshuffled its leadership at its Gigafactory in Nevada, where it produces powertrains and batteries for its various operations, and noted some production data.

The audio revealed Chris Lister, former VP of Gigafactory Operations has left the company and has been replaced by Hrushikesh “Hrushi” Sagar, who will oversee operations at Giga Nevada, and continue to oversee operations at the Fremont factory as well. Other new leaders at the Gigafactory include Energy Leader Matt Reddick, Site Leader Eric Montgomery who will handle day-to-day operations, and Jeff Jackson, who will lead infrastructure at Nevada.

In the meeting attended by hundreds of Gigafactory employees, CNBC notes Sagar also discussed new factory milestones and current production data across Nevada and the Fremont plant. Tesla Gigafactory Nevada - December 2019 (credit: Smnt Wikimedia Commons under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license)

Sagar said the Gigafactory Nevada produced 283,473 powertrains in Q2, which were then fed to Fremont and Giga Austin. Montgomery said the factory will need to increase output to 8,800 high voltage battery packs to support Fremont’s new production goals, and “maximize all-wheel-drive builds.”

Speaking of Fremont, Sagar revealed Fremont produced around 134,000 cars in Q2, and August was one of Fremont’s record months of production. Sagar said Fremont is producing around 12,000 cars a week, with 14,000 cars a week as its next goal. That would put Fremont production around 500K to 600K cars a year, allowing for factory downtime.

Tesla looks into lithium refining

On Tesla’s Q1 earnings call earlier this year, CEO Elon Musk joked to investors, “do you like minting money? Well, the lithium business is for you.”

Well, it seems Tesla is following its CEO’s advice, according to a recent application with the Texas Comptroller’s office.

Story continues

Tesla is looking into setting up a lithium refinery in Texas on the gulf coast, where it intends to process “raw ore material into a usable state for battery production,"" it said in the application. SpaceX founder and Tesla CEO Elon Musk looks on as he visits the construction site of Tesla's gigafactory in Gruenheide, near Berlin, Germany, May 17, 2021. REUTERS/Michele Tantussi

Reuters notes Tesla would be the first automaker to invest directly in lithium mining. This comes after many automakers like Tesla, Ford (F), GM (GM), and Stellantis (STLA) invested directly into acquiring raw lithium.

Tesla signed a supply deal with Australia-based Liontown Resources (LTR.AX) earlier this year.

The reason why automakers are getting involved is the lack of battery materials like raw and refined lithium needed for production, especially when looking at the expanded EV production plans the traditional automakers are all pushing by the end of the decade.

“We think that by 2030, about 2/3 of all new global auto production will be electrified, whether that's going to be a hybrid or a battery electric vehicle,” Morningstar Chief US market strategist Dave Sekura said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “So when we look at the amount of lithium that's being produced today and how much they expect to come online over the next decade, we think the lithium market is going to be pretty significantly undersupplied over the next decade.”

Currently, most of the refined lithium used by the automotive industry is coming from China. With new incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act for batteries produced in the U.S., and expanded consumer tax credits for cars with domestic battery materials, other automakers and suppliers are likely to invest more in lithium production and refining here at home.

978,Tap Into the Supercharged EV Industry With These 3 Stocks,"With a growth potential that seems impossible to measure, the EV market is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating and exciting stories being told over the last several years.

Simply put, the future is finally here.

And, it goes without saying that investors have a massive opportunity to reap tremendous gains from the industry’s growth trajectory over the next decade.

For investors looking to get in on the space, a few companies that are investing heavily within the EV industry include Ford Motor F, General Motors GM, and of course, the poster-child for the industry – Tesla TSLA.

Undoubtedly a major positive, all three stocks have soared over the last three months, crushing the S&P 500’s performance and indicating that buyers have been out in full force. This is shown in the chart below. Zacks Investment Research

Let’s take a deeper dive into each company.

Ford Motor

Ford F, an absolute titan in the automotive space, designs, manufactures, markets, and services cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles.

The company has aggressively pushed its EV growth – Ford is planning to spend nearly $50 billion on the segment by 2026, with a target production of over two million EVs by the end of said year.

The plan is expected to grow at a 49% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over the span of 2023 – 2026, undoubtedly boding well for long-term growth.

Even more impressive, Ford expects EVs to account for half of its global sales by 2030, solidifying its stance in a booming industry.

In addition, another major perk is that Ford pays out a rock-solid dividend – the company’s annual dividend yields 3.9%, well above its Zacks Sector average.

F has upped its dividend payout twice over the last five years, and its payout ratio sits sustainably at 22% of earnings. Zacks Investment Research

General Motors

General Motors GM is one of the world’s largest automakers, accounting for nearly 15% of the industry’s total sales in 2021.

Story continues

Like Ford, General Motors has focused on its EV operations – GM plans to roll out a whopping total of 30 brand-new EV models by the end of 2025. A few of its vital EV launches include the GMC Hummer, Cadillac Lyriq, Equinox, Silverado, and Blazer.

Further, the company’s BrightDrop and Ultium Charge 360 ventures bode well for future growth.

BrightDrop is aimed at offering an integrated ecosystem of electric first-to-last-mile products, and its Ultium Charge 360 focuses on improving the EV charging experience.

In addition, GM shares trade at a 5.9X forward earnings multiple, well below its five-year median of 6.6X and representing a steep 74% discount relative to its Zacks Sector. Zacks Investment Research

Tesla

Tesla TSLA is the poster child for the EV industry. However, Tesla is much more than a car company, offering many products outside its vehicles and evolving into a dynamic technology innovator over the last several years.

Of course, Tesla has already fully established its EV operations, thrusting it years ahead of its competitors. The company is the market leader in battery-powered EV sales in the US, with a market share of a steep 70%.

Tesla’s EV catalog includes the Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y. In addition, the company unveiled its Cybertruck in 2019, which is expected to be available in mid-2023.

It’s no secret that Tesla has found significant success - deliveries of Tesla Model 3/Y displayed a CAGR of more than 74% between 2019 and 2021.

Looking forward, Zacks expects an annualized growth rate of 45-50% in deliveries over the next three years, undoubtedly supercharged upticks.

In addition, Tesla carries stellar growth prospects – earnings are forecasted to soar nearly 80% in FY22 and an additional 30% in FY23. Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

The EV boom is finally here. And after years of speculation, it’s never felt more real.

It goes without saying that investors have a chance to reap unbelievable gains from the industry’s growth as we wade deeper and deeper into the waters.

The undisputed leader in the realm, Tesla TSLA, has already fully established its EV operations and is seen as the crown jewel.

However, Ford Motor F and General Motors GM have recently dove headfirst into EVs with enormous investment plans, boding well for their future growth.

All three companies above deserve a spot on any EV stock watchlist for investors looking to tap into a supercharged industry.

980,"Tesla considers opening lithium refinery in Texas, users vote on supercharger locations","Automotive reporter Pras Subramanian outlines Tesla's proposed plans to build a lithium refinery for their EV batteries and the vote between Tesla owners to decide the locations of supercharger stations.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Tesla looking to gain more control over its supply chain, specifically when it comes to one particular material. Pras Subramanian has the details on that. Pras.

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Seana. Elon Musk on the Q1 earnings call asked investors, do you like minting money? Then the lithium business is for you. Well, he actually is taking a page out of his own book. It seems Tesla filed an application with the Texas comptroller to build a lithium refinery on the Gulf Coast. It would process raw material for battery production, and they would ship that to other factories in Fremont and Texas.

Tesla said the decision will be based on tax credits received by the Texas government. And if approved, it would start building that refinery at the end of Q4, and then production of lithium would happen in 2024. So I want to note that Tesla-- many automakers have actually invested in lithium, actually the raw materials, but Tesla will be the first to build their own refinery that would directly refine lithium here in the United States.

- And Pras, Tesla is taking an unusual approach to map out its upcoming charging locations. What do we know about that?

PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, when this story came out, it was kind of shot down originally that Tesla was not going to allow people to vote on these supercharger locations. But then actually, Tesla tweeted out to users, supercharger voting coming soon. Reply with location suggestions. Replies the most likes will be included in the poll. So there's [? going to ?] be a two-stage process here where we'll take those most voted locations and have people vote on those.

So it's great news for Tesla owners if Tesla actually follows through on this. They don't actually have to. But they have around 3,600 locations worldwide. And at these locations, you'll have anywhere from 5 to 10 to 20 different plugs to charge. So it definitely depends on how many stalls you'll have at these locations.

So you got to ask, though, is this happening because there's now money involved because the White House is now offering $7.5 billion earmarked for a US charger network? And then also the bigger news, Rachelle, is will Tesla actually open up their network to non-Tesla owners? That's a huge thing people are watching, because their network as of right now is the most extensive.

SEANA SMITH: Pras we'll wait and see whether or not Tesla follows through. Only time will tell. Pras Subramanian, have a great weekend.",2022-09-09T19:40:39+00:00,2022-09-09

996,California's Green Dreams Mean Adding More EVs to a Rickety Grid,"(Bloomberg) -- California’s fight against global warming is on a collision course with its rickety grid. The state aims to end net greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, forcing many things that burn fossil fuels — particularly vehicles, factories and buildings — to switch to electricity. And yet California, the world’s fifth-largest economy, struggles to keep the lights on during its increasingly severe heat waves.

The state legislature recently voted to keep California’s last nuclear plant open past its planned 2025 retirement after projections showed years of tight power supplies to come. But even with the plant running, power demand will stretch the limits of supply — and that’s before millions of electric vehicles plug into the grid.

California wants most new cars to run on electricity by 2035 and may require new houses to contain all-electric appliances, perhaps as soon as 2026. EVs accounted for 15% of new car sales in the state this year, though only 800,000 of the 30 million vehicles on the state’s roads are EVs (plus about 400,000 plug-in hybrids).

“The state’s ambitions are way ahead of reality,” said Gary Ackerman, founder of the Western Power Trading Forum, a coalition of more than 100 companies advocating for competition in Western electricity markets. “You can glorify a zero-carbon world, but the reality is going to be much different and the timeline is going much slower.”

Conservative commentators have pointed with glee to California’s brushes with blackouts this week — the state on Friday canceled an emergency without having to resort to outages — coming so soon after finalizing rules for phasing out sales of new, gas-burning cars. But beneath the snark lies a real issue: California’s climate policies will increase electricity demand. They will require a grid that carries far more power than it does today, perhaps 80% more by 2045, according to a recent estimate from the California Air Resources Board.

Story continues

New solar and wind farms plus large-scale batteries are being plugged into the grid as fast as supply chains will allow, with renewables last year supplying a third of California’s electricity. Modeling from the Energy Innovation Policy & Technology research firm shows electricity demand could grow 18% from 2020 levels by 2030, as vehicles and buildings start to electrify.

Keeping up with that growth is quite doable, said Michael O’Boyle, the firm’s director of electricity policy. “We can maintain reliability and start to wind down the gas fleet, but we really need to maintain focus on execution and building out a diverse clean-energy portfolio,” he said. That includes the California Energy Commission’s new target of installing 2 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts of offshore wind turbines by 2030, a technology not yet deployed on the West Coast.

As for those electric cars, they could become a powerful tool for stabilizing the grid, rather than crushing it. Their batteries could supply power back to the grid in times of need, then recharge later, when electricity supplies rise.

“They’re giant batteries,” said Leah Stokes, a longtime climate advocate and a political scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. “It makes the grid more resilient, not less.”

The state and its electric utilities just need to ensure that drivers know not to recharge when they first get home in the evening — the same time they typically crank up their air conditioners and turn on the lights.

The drive to electrify everything still carries risks. While EV charging can be shifted to the middle of the night, much of the electricity needed for air conditioning or heating can’t. Californians will still need to use those systems at the same time, and they’ll need them more in an era of extreme temperatures, said Severin Borenstein, an energy economist at the University of California at Berkeley. He serves on the board of governors of the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state’s grid. Climate models suggest the state may receive less rainfall in the future, even after the current drought ends. That means hydropower dams, once a major source of clean energy for California, won’t generate much power.

Meanwhile, California’s growing dependence on solar power is leaving it vulnerable on hot evenings after the sun sets. The state has turned to large-scale batteries to cover the gap, with enough of them installed in recent years to supply 3.3 gigawatts of electricity. But they typically discharge for just four hours at a time, not enough to replace the gas-burning plants that currently keep the lights on at night. Longer-term energy storage is needed, but the only kind widely used in the state is pumped-hydro storage, which requires building pairs of reservoirs at different elevations in hilly or mountainous terrain.

Michael Wara, director of Stanford University’s climate and energy policy program says the transition to a more electrified future can work so long as the state accelerates deployment.

“We’re changing all of the parts of the airplane while it’s in midair. That airplane has to not crash,” he said.
